18 th Dynasty Amenhotep III Ancient Egyptian jmntp.w Amntp IPA amanutpu45 Amun is satisfied6 also known as Amenhotep the Magnificent or Amenhotep the Great and Hellenized as Amenophis III was the ninth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty. According to different authors he ruled Egypt from June 1386 to 1349 BC or from June 1388 BC to December 1351 BC1350 BC7 after his father Thutmose IV died. Amenhotep was Thutmoses son by a minor wife Mutemwiya.8 His reign was a period of unprecedented prosperity and splendour when Egypt reached the peak of its artistic and international power and as such he is considered one of ancient Egypts greatest pharaohs.91011 When he died in the 
38 th or 
39 th year of his reign he was succeeded by his son Amenhotep IV who later changed his name to Akhenaten. Family and early lifeedit Amenhotep and Tiye with one of their daughters Amenhotep was the son of Thutmose IV and his minor wife Mutemwiya. He was born probably around 1401 BC.12 Later in his life Amenhotep commissioned the depiction of his divine birth to be displayed at Luxor Temple. Amenhotep claimed that his true father was the god Amun who had taken the form of Thutmose IV to father a child with Mutemwiya.1314 In Regnal Year 2 Amenhotep married Tiye the daughter of Yuya and Thuya. Tiye was Great Royal Wife throughout Amenhoteps reign. Many commemorative scarabs were commissioned and distributed during Amenhoteps reign. On the marriage scarabs Amenhotep affirmed his divine power and the legitimacy of his wife. With Tiye Amenhotep fathered at least two sons Crown Prince Thutmose and Amenhotep IV later called Akhenaten. In addition several daughters are frequently credited to the couple Sitamun Henuttaneb Iset Nebetah and Beketaten.15 Most of the daughters appear frequently on statues and reliefs from Amenhoteps reign.16 However Nebetah is attested only once on a colossal limestone group of statues from Medinet Habu1517 and Beketaten only appears in Amarna.18 One of the many commemorative marriage scarabs of Amenhotep which affirm the divine power of the king and the legitimacy of his wife Tiye. Walters Art Museum Baltimore. Amenhotep is also sometimes credited as the father of Smenkhkare or Tutankhamun with varying proposals for their mothers but these theories are not as accepted as his other known children. In addition to Tiye Amenhotep had several other wives. In Regnal Year 10 Amenhotep married Gilukhepa the daughter of Shuttarna II of Mitanni.19 He later married Tadukhepa daughter of Tushratta of Mitanni in or around Regnal Year 36 of his reign.2021 Other wives whose names are unknown included a daughter of Kurigalzu king of Babylon a daughter of KadashmanEnlil king of Babylon a daughter of Tarhundaradu ruler of Arzawa and a daughter of the ruler of Ammia modernday Syria.21 Finally he married at least two of his daughters Sitamun and Iset in the last decade of his reign. Jarlabel inscriptions from Regnal Year 30 indicate that Sitamun was elevated to the status of Great Royal Wife by that time.15 Although shunned by common Egyptians incest was not uncommon among royalty.22 A sculpture restored by Amenhotep for his grandfather Amenhotep II shows Sitamun with a young prince beside her.22 This has led to theories that Sitamun was the mother of Smekhkare andor Tutankhamun. Life and reignedit Queen Tiye Great Royal Wife of Amenhotep Amenhotep probably became pharaoh when he was between the ages of 6 and 12. While it is likely that a regent would have ruled until he came of age none is attested in the surviving records. In Regnal Year 11 Amenhotep commanded the construction of an artificial lake at Tiyes hometown of Djakaru. He then celebrated a Festival of Opening the Lake in the third month of Inundation day sixteen and rowed the royal barge Atentjehen on the lake. This event was commemorated on at least eleven commemorative scarabs.23 From other scarabs Amenhotep is known to have killed either 102 or 110 lions in the first ten years of his reign.24 Despite the martial prowess Amenhotep displayed during the hunt he is known to have participated in only one military incident. In Regnal Year Five he led a victorious campaign against a rebellion in Kush. This victory was commemorated by three rockcarved stelae found near Aswan and Sa in Nubia. The official account of Amenhoteps military victory emphasizes his martial prowess with the hyperbole typical of the period.25 Court of Amenhotep IIIedit There is a significant attestation for the court officials who served during Amenhoteps reign primarily through the discovery of their tombs in the Theban Necropolis. Among these court officials were the viziers Ramose Amenhotep Aperel and Ptahmose. Other officials included the treasurers Ptahmose and Merire the high stewards Amenemhat Surer and Amenhotep Huy and the Viceroy of Kush Merimose. Amenhotep son of Hapu held many offices during the reign of Amenhotep the pharaoh but is best known for receiving the right to build his mortuary temple behind that of the king.26 Amenhotep son of Hapu was deified after his death and was one of the few nonroyals to be worshiped in such a manner.2728 Malkata Palaceedit The palace of Malkata was built in the 
14 th century BC and its ancient name was PerHay House of Rejoicing. Originally the palace was known as the Palace of the Dazzling Aten. Built mostly out of mudbrick it was Amenhoteps residence throughout most of the later part of his reign. Construction began around Regnal Year 11 and continued until the king moved to the palace permanently around Regnal Year 29. Once completed it was the largest royal residence in Egypt. Sed festivalsedit Amenhotep celebrated three Sed festivals in Regnal Years 30 34 and 37 each at Malkata palace in Western Thebes.29 A temple of Amun and festival hall were built especially for the celebrations.30 The Sed festival was a tradition that dated to the Old Kingdom31 consisting of a series of tests that demonstrated the pharaohs fitness for continuing as ruler of Egypt. Based on indications left by Queen Tiyes steward Khenruef the festival may have lasted two to eight months.32 Amenhotep wanted his Sed Festivals to be far more spectacular than those of the past.33 He appointed Amenhotep son of Hapu to plan the ceremony potentially because he was one of the few courtiers still alive to have served at the last Sed Festival held for Amenhotep II.33 In preparation for the first Sed Festival Amenhotep son of Hapu enlisted scribes to gather information from records and inscriptions most found in ancient funerary temples33 describing the appropriate rituals and costumes. Temples were built and statues erected up and down the Nile. Craftsmen and jewelers created ornaments commentating the event including jewelry ornaments and stelae.33 The scribe Nebmerutef coordinated every step of the event.34 He directed Amenhotep to use his mace to knock on the temple doors. Beside him AmenhotepHapu mirrored his effort like a royal shadow.34 The king was followed by Queen Tiye and the royal daughters. When moving to another venue the banner of the jackal god Wepwawet Opener of Ways preceded the King. The king changed his costume at each major activity of the celebration.34 One of the major highlights of the festival was the kings dual coronation. He was enthroned separately for Upper and Lower Egypt. For Upper Egypt Amenhotep wore the white crown but changed to the red crown for the Lower Egypt coronation.35 After the Sed festival Amenhotep transcended from being a neargod to one divine.36 The king may have later traveled across Egypt following the festival potentially reenacting the ceremony for different audiences.32 Few Egyptian kings lived long enough for their own celebration. Those who survived used the celebration as the affirmation of transition to divinity. International relationsedit Amarna letter. Letter from Labayu ruler of Shechem to the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III or his son Akhenaten. 
14 th century BCE. From Tell elAmarna Egypt. Diplomatic correspondence from Amenhoteps reign are partially preserved in the Amarna Letters a collection of documents found near the city of Amarna. The letters come from the rulers of Assyria Mitanni Babylon Hatti and other states typically including requests by those rulers for gold and other gifts from Amenhotep. The letters cover the period from Year 30 of Amenhotep until at least the end of Akhenatens reign. In Amarna Letter EA 4 Amenhotep is quoted by the Babylonian king KadashmanEnlil I in firmly rejecting the latters entreaty to marry one of this pharaohs daughters From time immemorial no daughter of the king of Egypt is given to anyone.37 Amenhoteps refusal to allow one of his daughters to be married to the Babylonian monarch may indeed have followed from Egyptian royal custom which allowed a claim upon the throne through descent from a royal princess. It could also be viewed as a diplomatic stratagem to enhance Egypts prestige as Amenhotep himself married the daughters of several foreign rulers while refusing them his own daughters. The Amarna Letters also reference the exchange between Amenhotep and the Mitanni King Tushratta of the statue of a healing goddess Ishtar of Nineveh late in Amenhoteps reign. Scholars have generally assumed that the statues sojourn to Egypt was requested by Amenhotep in order to cure him of his various ailments which included painful abscesses in his teeth.38 However William L. Morans analysis of Amarna Letter EA 23 relating to the dispatch of the statue to Thebes discounts this theory. The arrival of the statue is known to have coincided with Amenhoteps marriage with Tadukhepa Tushrattas daughter in the pharaohs 
36 th year letter EA 
23 s arrival in Egypt is dated to regnal year 36 the fourth month of winter day 1 of his reign.39 Furthermore Tushratta never mentions in EA 23 that the statues dispatch was meant to heal Amenhotep of his maladies. Instead Tushratta writes in part ... Thus auka of Nineveh mistress of all lands I wish to go to Egypt a country that I love and then return. Now I herewith send her and she is on her way. Now in the time too of my father...she went to this country and just as earlier she dwelt there and they honored her may my brother now honor her 10 times more than before. May my brother honor her then at his pleasure let her go so that she may come back. May auka i.e. Ishtar the mistress of heaven protect us my brother and me a 100000 years and may our mistress grant both of us great joy. And let us act as friends. Is auka for me alone my goddess and for my brother not his goddess40 The likeliest explanation is that the statue was sent to Egypt to shed her blessings on the wedding of Amenhotep and Tadukhepa as she had been sent previously for Amenhotep and Gilukhepa.41 Moran agrees that this explanation was more likely.42 Further Moran argues that the contents of Amarna Letter EA 21 support this claim wherein Tushratta asks the gods including Ishtar for their blessing of the marriage. 43 In the 
14 th century BCE the pharaoh sent an expedition to Cyprus to establish Egyptian control over the island which was subsequently maintained for several centuries. During this time the Egyptians established a number of settlements on the island and they exported copper and other raw materials from Cyprus to Egypt in exchange for luxury goods and other commodities.

Successionedit Thutmose the eldest son of Amenhotep III with his wife Tiye became Crown Prince46 but died before his father. Amenhotep was ultimately succeeded by his second son who ascended the throne as Amenhotep IV and later took the name Akhenaten. Proposed coregency with Amenhotep IV  Akhenatenedit It has long been theorized that Amenhotep III shared a coregency with his son Amenhotep IV. Lawrence Berman has claimed that proponents of the coregency theory tended to be art historians while historians remained unconvinced.47 Eric Cline Nicholas Reeves Peter Dorman and other scholars argue strongly against the establishment of a long coregency between the two rulers and in favor of either no coregency or one of at most two years.48 Donald B. Redford William J. Murnane Alan Gardiner and Lawrence Berman contest the view of any coregency whatsoever between Akhenaten and his father. A statue head of Amenhotep III collected by the Cleveland Museum of Art. The image was created during his reign. Evidence against a coregency includes Amarna Letter EA 27 which is dated to Regnal Year 2 of Amenhotep IV. The subject of the letter involves a complaint from the Mitannian king Tushratta claiming that Amenhotep IV did not honor his fathers promise to send Tushratta gold statues as part of the marriage arrangement between Tadukhepa and Amenhotep III.49 This correspondence implies that if any coregency occurred between Amenhotep and Akhenaten it lasted no more than a year.50 However in February 2014 Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced that findings from the tomb of Vizier AmenhotepHuy gave conclusive evidence of a coregency that lasted at least eight years.5152 In the tomb the cartouches of the two pharaohs were carved side by side. However this conclusion has since been called into question by other egyptologists according to whom the inscription means only that construction on AmenhotepHuys tomb started during Amenhotep IIIs reign and ended under Akhenatens and AmenhotepHuy thus simply wanted to pay his respects to both rulers carving their names separately rather than simultaneously. Later lifeedit Amenhotep and Sobek from Dahamsha now in the Luxor Museum Health and deathedit Amenhoteps greatest attested regnal date is Year 38 which appears on wine jarlabel dockets from Malkata.53 He may have lived briefly into an unrecorded Year 39 and died before the wine harvest of that year.54 Reliefs from the wall of the temple of Soleb in Nubia and scenes from the Theban tomb of Kheruef Steward of the Kings Great Wife Tiye depict Amenhotep as a visibly weak and sick figure.55 Scientists believe that in his final years he suffered from arthritis and obesity. Further a forensic examination of his mummy revealed worn and cavitypitted teeth which must have inflicted constant pain. An examination of the mummy by the Australian anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith concluded that the pharaoh had died at between the age of 40 and 
50.5 6 He was survived by at least one child his successor Amenhotep IV. His wife Tiye is known to have outlived him by at least twelve years as she is mentioned in several Amarna letters dated from her sons reign as well as depicted at the royal dinner table in Akhenatens years 9 and 12 in scenes from the tomb of Huya.5747 Foreign leaders communicated their grief at the pharaohs death with Tushratta saying When I heard that my brother Nimmureya had gone to his fate on that day I sat down and wept. On that day I took no food I took no water.58 Burial and mummyedit The mummy of Amenhotep III during unwrapping Amenhotep was buried in tomb WV22 in the Western Valley of the Valley of the Kings outside of Thebes. The tomb is the largest in the West Valley of the Kings and includes two side chambers for his Great Royal Wives Tiye and Sitamun. However it does not seem that either woman was buried there. During the reign of Smendes in the Third Intermediate Period Amenhoteps mummy was later moved to the mummy cache in KV35 along with several other pharaohs of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties where it lay until discovered by Victor Loret in 18

These statues provide a series of portraits covering the entire length of his reign. When Amenhotep died he left behind a country at the very height of its power and influence commanding immense respect in the international world. However it was a country wedded to ageold political and religious certainties under the Amun priesthood.63 The resulting upheavals from his son Akhenatens reforming zeal shook these old certainties to their foundations and forced the momentous question whether a pharaoh was more powerful than his society as represented in the worship of Amun. Akhenaten even moved the capital away from Thebes the center of Amuns worship and built Amarna a city dedicated to his new deity the Aten.64 Amenhotep built extensively at the temple of Karnak including the Luxor temple with two pylons a colonnade behind the new temple entrance and a new temple to the goddess Maat. Amenhotep dismantled the Fourth Pylon of the Temple of Amun at Karnak to construct a new Third Pylon  and created a new entrance to this structure where he erected two rows of columns with open papyrus capitals down the centre of this newly formed forecourt.citation needed The forecourt between the Third and Fourth Pylons sometimes called an obelisk court was also decorated with scenes of the sacred funerary barques of the deities Amun Mut and Khonsu.65 The king also started work on the Tenth Pylon at the Temple of Amun. Amenhoteps first recorded act as king  in his Years 1 and 2  was to open new limestone quarries at Tura just south of Cairo and at Dayr alBarsha in Middle Egypt to undertake his great building projects.66 He virtually covered Nubia with new monuments ...including a small temple with a colonnade dedicated to Thutmose III at Elephantine a rock temple dedicated to Amun Lord of the Ways at Wadi esSebuam and the temple of Horus of Miam at Aniba...as well as founding additional temples at Kawa and Sesebi.67 Luxor Temple of Amenhotep His enormous mortuary temple on the west bank of the Nile was in its day the largest religious complex in Thebes but the king built too close to the floodplain and less than two hundred years later it was reduced to ruins. Much of the masonry was purloined by Merneptah and later pharaohs for their own construction projects.68 All that remained standing was the gateway with the Colossi of Memnon  two massive stone statues depicting Amenhotep18 m 59 ft high. Amenhotep also built the Third Pylon at Karnak and erected 600 statues of the goddess Sekhmet in the Temple of Mut to the south.69 Some of the most magnificent statues of New Kingdom Egypt date to his reign such as the two outstanding couchant rose granite lions originally set before the temple at Soleb in Nubia as well as a large series of royal sculptures.70 Several black granite seated statues of Amenhotep wearing the nemes headress have come from excavations behind the Colossi of Memnon as well as from Tanis in the Delta.70 In 2014 two giant statues of Amenhotep toppled by an earthquake in 1200 BC were reconstructed from more than 200 fragments and reerected at the northern gate of the kings funerary temple.71 One of the most stunning finds of royal statues dating to his reign was made as recently as 1989 in the courtyard of Amenhotep s colonnade of the Temple of Luxor. The cache of statues included a nearly undamaged 6 feet 
1.8  mhigh pink quartzite statue of the king wearing the Double Crown.70 It was mounted on a sled and may have been a cult statue.70 Only the name of the god Amun had been hacked out wherever it appeared in the pharaohs cartouche clearly part of Akhenatens campaign against the god of his father.70 Obverse The Stela of Amenhotep. back raised by Merenptah 12131203 a.c.

A Sed Festival Stela of Amenhotep III was taken from Egypt to Europe by an art dealer.

Cassirer suggests this was another example of Akhenatens vandalism against Amun76 Other gods displayed on the stela Re and Maat showed no damage.76 The altered stela may then have been displayed by Akhenaten. Another striking characteristic of Amenhoteps reign is the series of over 200 large commemorative stone scarabs that have been discovered over a large geographic area ranging from Syria Ras Shamra through to Soleb in Nubia.77 Similarly five other scarabs state that his wife Gilukhepa of Mitanni arrived in Egypt with a retinue of 317 women. She was the first of many such princesses who would enter the pharaohs family.24 Ancestry and geneticsedit Ancestors of Amenhotep III 16. Thutmose II 8. Thutmose III 17. Iset 4. Amenhotep II 9.

Although only a partial profile was obtained he shares his YDNA haplogroup R
1 b with his son and grandson upholding the family tree outlined in the earlier study. However the specific clade of R
1 b was not determined. The mitochondrial haplogroup of Amenhotep III was found to be H
2 b79 which is associated with migrations from the PonticCaspian steppe to South Asia and the spread of IndoIranian languages.8081 In 2022 S.O.Y. Keita analysed 8 Short Tandem loci STR published data from studies by Hawass et al. 201020128283 which sought to determine familial relations and research pathological features such as potential infectious diseases among the New Kingdom royal mummies including Tutankhamun Amenhotep III and Rameses III. Keita used the Popaffiliator algorithm which differentiates Eurasians SubSaharan Africans and East Asians he concluded that a majority have an affinity with SubSaharan Africans in one affinity analysis. However he emphasized the complexity of ethnic attributions cautioning that the royal mummies may have had other affiliations obscured by the typological categories and that different data and algorithms might give different results.84 According to historian William Stiebling and archaeologist Susan N. Helft conflicting DNA analyses by different research teams have thusfar failed to establish consensus on the genetic makeup of the ancient Egyptians and their geographic origins.85 Galleryedit Granodiorite seated statue of Amenhotep at the British Museum from its left side.

2 b is a minor branch. It contains several ancient samples from Russia all basal to the rest of the branch including one individual from the Yamnaya culture and one from the Late Bronze Age Srubnaya culture both from the PonticCaspian Steppe region and five other Bronze Age samples from east of the Volga river three from Sintashta and two from Krasnoyarsk. Also in a basal position there are three modern Russian samples two from the Altai region and one Danish sequence. Interestingly while the vast majority 70 of H2 modern sequences in our dataset are of European origin H
2 b displays a strong South Asian component with seven samples from Pakistan India and Sri Lanka. The newly published Sintashta and Middle Bronze Age Krasnoyarsk Russian sequences Narasimhan et al.2018 together with the previously released Yamnaya and Srubnaya span a period from 5 to 
3.5  ka. These plus the modern South Asian sequences support our earlier suggestion that H
2 b was involved in movements east and southwards from the PonticCaspian region into South Asia by documenting its progress eastwards across the Eurasian Steppe. The Sintashta culture in the Ural Mountains or a Sintashtaderived culture such as the Andronovo is thought to have expanded eastwards into Central Asia
