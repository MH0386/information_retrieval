Howard Carter opens the coffin of the Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh Tutankhamun Egyptology from Egypt and Greek  logia Arabic   is the scientific study of ancient Egypt. The topics studied include ancient Egyptian history language literature religion architecture and art from the 
5 th millennium BC until the end of its native religious practices in the 
4 th century AD. Historyedit First explorersedit The earliest explorers of ancient Egypt were the ancient Egyptians themselves. Inspired by a dream he had Thutmose IV led an excavation of the Great Sphinx of Giza and inscribed a description of the dream on the Dream Stele. Less than two centuries later Prince Khaemweset fourth son of Ramesses II would gain fame for identifying and restoring historic buildings tombs and temples including pyramids and has subsequently been described as the first Egyptologist.1 GraecoRoman Periodedit Some of the first historical accounts of Egypt were given by Herodotus Strabo Diodorus Siculus and the largely lost work of Manetho an Egyptian priest during the reign of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II in the 
3 rd century BC. The Ptolemies were very interested in the work of the ancient Egyptians and many of the Egyptian monuments including the pyramids were restored by them. The Ptolemies also built many new temples in the Egyptian style. The Romans also carried out restoration work in Egypt. Middle Agesedit Throughout the Middle Ages travelers on pilgrimages to the Holy Land would occasionally detour to visit sites in Egypt. Destinations would include Cairo and its environs where the Holy Family was thought to have fled and the great Pyramids which were thought to be Josephs Granaries built by the Hebrew patriarch to store grain during the years of plenty. A number of their accounts Itineraria have survived and offer insights into conditions in their respective time periods.2 Ibn Wahshiyyas 985 CE incorrect translation of the Ancient Egyptian hieroglyph alphabet Abdul Latif alBaghdadi a teacher at Cairos AlAzhar University in the 
13 th century wrote detailed descriptions of ancient Egyptian monuments.3 Similarly the 
15 thcentury Egyptian historian alMaqrizi wrote detailed accounts of Egyptian antiquities.4 European explorersedit European exploration and travel writings of ancient Egypt commenced in the 
13 th century with only occasional detours into what could be considered a scientific approach notably by Claude Sicard Benot de Maillet Frederic Louis Norden and Richard Pococke. In the early 
17 th century John Greaves measured the pyramids having inspected the broken Obelisk of Domitian in Rome then intended for Lord Arundels collection in London.5 He went on to publish the illustrated Pyramidographia in 1646. The Jesuit scientistpriest Athanasius Kircher was perhaps the first to hint at the phonetic importance of Egyptian hieroglyphs demonstrating Coptic as a vestige of early Egyptian for which he is considered a founder of Egyptology.6 Modern Egyptologyedit See also Pyramidology  History JeanBaptiste Bourguignon dAnvilles 1765 map of Ancient Egypt was a significant advance in the cartography of the subject allowing readers to understand ancient and modern sites more clearly than previously. It was the primary map used in the 18091829 Description de lgypte.7 The gold funerary mask of Tutankhamun one of the most symbolic artifacts representing ancient Egypt and Egyptology today Hieroglyphs and depictions transcribed by Ippolito Rosellini in 1832 Egyptologys modern history begins with the invasion of Egypt by Napoleon Bonaparte in the late 
18 th century. The Rosetta Stone was discovered in 1799. The study of many aspects of ancient Egypt became more scientifically oriented with the publication of Mmoires sur lgypte in 1800 and the more comprehensive Description de lEgypte between 1809 and 1829. These recorded Egyptian flora fauna and historymaking numerous ancient Egyptian source materials available to Europeans for the first time.8 The British captured Egypt from the French and gained the Rosetta Stone in 1801 the Greek script of which was translated by 1803. In 1822 the corresponding Egyptian hieroglyphs were deciphered by JeanFranois Champollion marking the beginning of modern Egyptology. With increasing knowledge of Egyptian writing the study of ancient Egypt was able to proceed with greater academic rigour. Champollion Thomas Young and Ippolito Rosellini were some of the first Egyptologists of wide acclaim. The German Karl Richard Lepsius was an early participant in the investigations of Egyptmapping excavating and recording several sites. English Egyptologist Flinders Petrie 18531942 introduced archaeological techniques of field preservation recording and excavation to the field. Many highly educated amateurs also travelled to Egypt including women such as Harriet Martineau and Florence Nightingale. Both of these left accounts of their travels which revealed learned familiarity with all of the latest European Egyptology.9 Howard Carters 1922 discovery of the tomb of 
18 th Dynasty King Tutankhamun brought a greater understanding of Egyptian relics and wide acclaim to the field. In the modern era the Ministry of State for Antiquities10 controls excavation permits for Egyptologists to conduct their work. The field can now use geophysical methods and other applications of modern sensing techniques. In June 200011 the European Institute for Underwater Archaeology IEASM directed by Franck Goddio in cooperation with the Egyptian Ministry for Antiquities discovered the ancient sunken city of ThonisHeracleion in todays Abu Qir Bay. The statues of a colossal King and Queen are on display at the Grand Egyptian Museum. Other discovered artefacts are exhibited at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina and Alexandria National Museum ANM. The excavations are documented through several publications1213 In March 2017 the EgyptianGerman team of archaeologists unearthed an eightmeter 30
00 yearold statue that included a head and a torso thought to depict Pharaoh Ramses II. According to Khaled ElEnany the Egyptian Antiquities Minister the statue was more likely thought to be King Psammetich I. Excavators also revealed an 80 cmlong part of a limestone statue of Pharaoh Seti II while excavating the site.1415161718 In August 2017 archaeologists from the Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of five mudbrick tombs at Bir eshShaghala dating back nearly 2000 years. Researchers also revealed worn masks gilded with gold several large jars and a piece of pottery with unsolved ancient Egyptian writing on it.192021 In November 2017 25 October 2000 the Egyptian mission in cooperation with the European Institute for Underwater Archaeology announced the discovery of 20
00 yearold three sunken shipwrecks dated back to the Roman Era in Alexandrias Abu Qir Bay.2223 The sunken cargo included a royal head of crystal perhaps belong to the commander of the Roman armies of Antonio three gold coins from the era of Emperor Octavius Augustus large wooden planks and pottery vessels.24 In April 2018 the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of the head of the bust of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius at the Temple of Kom Ombo in Aswan during work to protect the site from groundwater.2526 In April 2018 the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of the shrine of god Osiris Ptah Neb dating back to the 
25 th dynasty in the Temple of Karnak in Luxor. According to archaeologist Essam Nagy the material remains from the area contained clay pots the lower part of a sitting statue and part of a stone panel showing an offering table filled with a sheep and a goose which were the symbols of the god Amun.27 In July 2018 GermanEgyptian researchers team head by Ramadan Badry Hussein of the University of Tbingen reported the discovery of an extremely rare gilded burial mask that probably dates from the SaitePersian period in a partly damaged wooden coffin in Saqqara. The last time a similar mask was found was in 1939. The eyes were covered with obsidian calcite and black hued gemstone possibly onyx. The finding of this mask could be called a sensation. Very few masks of precious metal have been preserved to the present day because the tombs of most Ancient Egyptian dignitaries were looted in ancient times. said Hussein.2829 In July 2018 archaeologists led by Zeinab Hashish announced the discovery of a 20
00 yearold 
30 ton black granite sarcophagus in Alexandria. It contained three damaged skeletons in redbrown sewage water. According to archaeologist Mostafa Waziri the skeletons looked like a family burial with a middleaged woman and two men. Researchers also revealed a small gold artifact and three thin sheets of gold.303132 In September 2018 a sandstone sphinx statue was discovered at the temple of Kom Ombo. The statue measuring approximately 28 cm 11 in in width and 38 cm 15 in in height likely dates to the Ptolemaic Dynasty.333435 In September 2018 several dozen cache of mummies dating 2000 years back were found in Saqqara by a team of Polish archaeologists led by Kamil Kuraszkiewicz from the Faculty of Oriental Studies of the University of Warsaw.36 In November 2018 an Egyptian archaeological mission located seven ancient Egyptian tombs at the ancient necropolis of Saqqara containing a collection of scarab and cat mummies dating back to the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties. Three of the tombs were used for cats some dating back more than 6000 years while one of four other sarcophagi was unsealed. With the remains of cat mummies were unearthed gilded and 100 wooden statues of cats and one in bronze dedicated to the cat goddess Bastet. In addition funerary items dating back to the 
12 th Dynasty were found besides the skeletal remains of cats.3738 In midDecember 2018 the Egyptian government announced the discovery at Saqqara of a previously unknown 44
00 yearold tomb containing paintings and more than fifty sculptures. It belongs to Wahtye a highranking priest who served under King Neferirkare Kakai during the Fifth Dynasty. The tomb also contains four shafts that lead to a sarcophagus below.39 According to the AlAhram in January 2019 archaeologists headed by Mostafa Waziri revealed a collection of 20 tombs dated back to the Second Intermediate Period in Kom AlKhelgan. The burials contained the remains of animals amulets and scarabs carved from faience round and oval pots with handholds flint knives broken and burned pottery. All burials included skulls and skeletons in the bending position and were not very wellpreserved.4041 In April 2019 archaeologists discovered 35 mummified remains of Egyptians in a tomb in Aswan. Italian archaeologist Patrizia Piacentini professor of Egyptology at the University of Milan and Khaled ElEnany the Egyptian minister of antiquities reported that the tomb where the remains of ancient men women and children were found dates back to the GrecoRoman period between 332 BC and 395 AD. While the findings assumed belonging to a mother and a child were well preserved others had suffered major destruction. Beside the mummies artefacts including painted funerary masks vases of bitumen used in mummification pottery and wooden figurines were revealed. Thanks to the hieroglyphics on the tomb it was detected that the tomb belongs to a tradesman named Tjit.424344 On 13 April 2019 an expedition led by a member of the Czech Institute of Egyptology Mohamed Megahed discovered a 40
00 yearold tomb near Egypts Saqqara Necropolis in Saqqara. Archaeologists confirmed that the tomb belonged to an influential person named Khuwy who lived in Egypt during the 
5 th Dynasty. The Lshaped Khuwy tomb starts with a small corridor heading downwards into an antechamber and from there a larger chamber with painted reliefs depicting the tomb owner seated at an offerings table reported Megahed. Some paintings maintained their brightness over a long time in the tomb. Mainly made of white limestone bricks the tomb had a tunnel entrance generally typical for pyramids. Archaeologists say that there might be a connection between Khuwy and pharaoh because the mausoleum was found near the pyramid of Egyptian Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi who ruled during that time.454647 In July 2019 ancient granite columns and a smaller Greek temple treasureladen ships along with bronze coins from the reign of Ptolemy II pottery dating back to the third and fourth centuries BC were found at the sunken city of Heracleion. The investigations were conducted by Egyptian and European divers led by underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio. They also uncovered the ruins of the citys main temple off of Egypts north coast.48495051 In September 2019 archaeologists announced the discovery of a 22
00 yearold temple believed to belong to the Ptolemy IV Philosopher of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Kom Shakau village of Tama township. Researchers also revealed limestone walls carved with inscriptions of Hapi the Nile god and inscriptions with fragments of text featuring the name of Ptolemy IV.525354 In May 2020 EgyptianSpanish archaeological mission head by Esther Ponce uncovered a unique cemetery dating back to the 
26 th Dynasty socalled the ElSawi era at the site of ancient Oxyrhynchus. Archaeologists found tombstones bronze coins small crosses and clay seals inside eight Romanera tombs with domed and unmarked roofs.5556 On 3 October 2020 Khalid elAnany Egypts tourism and antiquities minister announced the discovery of at least 59 sealed sarcophagi with mummies more than 2600 years old in Saqqara. Archaeologists also revealed the 20 statues of PtahSoker and a carved 
35 centimeter tall bronze statue of god Nefertem.575859 On 19 October 2020 the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced the discovery of more than 2500 years of colorful sealed sarcophagi in Saqqara. The archaeological team unearthed gilded wooden statues and more than 80 coffins.6061 In November 2020 archaeologists unearthed more than 100 delicately painted wooden coffins and 40 funeral statues. The sealed wooden coffins some containing mummies date as far back as 2500 years. Other artifacts discovered include funeral masks canopic jars and amulets. According to Khaled elAnany tourism and antiquities minister the items date back to the Ptolemaic dynasty. One of the coffins was opened and a mummy was scanned with an Xray determining it was most likely a man about the age of 
40.6 26364 In January 2021 the Tourism and Antiquities Ministry announced the discovery of more than 50 wooden sarcophagi in 52 burial shafts which date back to the New Kingdom period and a 13 ftlong papyrus that contains texts from the Book of the Dead. Archaeologists led by Zahi Hawass also found the funerary temple of Naert and warehouses made of bricks in Saqqara.6566 In January 2021 EgyptianDominican researchers led by Kathleen Martinez have announced the discovery of 20
00 yearold ancient tombs with golden tongues dating to the Greek and Roman periods at Taposiris Magna. The team also unearthed gold leaf amulets in the form of tongues placed for speaking with God Osiris afterlife. The mummies were depicted in different forms one of them was wearing a crown decorated with horns and the cobra snake at the forehead and the other was depicted with gilded decorations representing the wide necklace.67686970 A team of archaeologists led by Zahi Hawass also found the funerary temple of Naert or Narat and warehouses made of bricks in Saqqara. Researchers also revealed that Narats name engraved on a fallen obelisk near the main entrance. Previously unknown to researchers Naert was a wife of Teti the first king of the sixth dynasty.717273 In February 2021 archaeologists from the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced the discovery of a Ptolemaic period temple a Roman fort an early Coptic church and an inscription written in hieratic script at an archaeological site called Shiha Fort in Aswan. According to Mostafa Waziri the crumbling temple was decorated with palm leaf carvings and an incomplete sandstone panel that described a Roman emperor. According to researcher Abdel Badie generally the church with about 
2.1  meters width contained oven that were used to bake pottery four rooms a long hall stairs and stone tiles.7475 In April 2021 Egyptian archeologists announced the discovery of 110 burial tombs at the Koum elKhulgan archeological site in Dakahlia Governorate. 68 ovalshaped tombs of them dated back to the Predynastic Period and 37 rectangularshaped tombs were from Second Intermediate Period. Rest of them dated back to the Naqada III period. The tombs also contained the remains of adults and a baby buried in a jar a group of ovens stoves remnants of mudbrick foundations funerary equipment cylindrical pearshaped vessels and a bowl with geometric designs.767778 In September 2021 archaeologists announce the discovery of ritualistic tools used in religious rituals at the ancient site of Tel alFara in the Kafr ElSheikh Governorate. Remains included a limestone pillar depicting goddess Hathor some incense burners with the head of the god Horus. Hossam Ghanim said The mission also discovered a huge building of polished limestone from the inside representing a well for holy water used in daily rituals.7980 In May 2022 the discovery of the nearly 43
00 yearold tomb of an ancient Egyptian highranked person who handled royal sealed documents of pharaoh was announced at Saqqara Egypt. According to University of Warsaws Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology the elaborately decorated tomb belonged to a man named Mehtjetju who served as a priest and an inspector of the royal property. Kamil O. Kuraszkiewicz expedition director stated that Mehtjetju most likely lived at about the same time at some point during the reigns of the first three rulers of the Sixth Dynasty Teti Userkare and Pepy I.8182 In June 2022 archaeologists from The Cairo Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of an alabaster bust of Alexander the Great as well as molds and other materials for creating amulets for warriors and for statues of Alexander the Great.8384 In July 2022 archaeologists from the Pragues Charles University led by Miroslav Brta discovered the robbed tomb of an ancient Egyptian military official named WahibremeryNeith and a scarab in Gizas Abusir necropolis 12 km southeast of the Pyramids of Giza. He commanded battalions of nonlocal soldiers and likely lived in the late 
26 th and early 
27 th dynasties around 500 BC according to the Egyptian Antiquities Ministry. The tombs main well was about 6 meters deep and it was divided into separate parts by narrow bridges cut into the natural rock. Inside the main well there was a smaller and deeper shaft which contained two sarcophagi one inside the other where WahibremeryNeith was buried. The external sarcophagus was made of white limestone while the internal coffin was made out of basalt rock measures 
2.3 0 meters long and 
1.9 8 meters wide. The inner sarcophagus contained an inscription from the 
72 nd chapter of the Egyptian Book of Dead said Marslav Barta.858687 In August 2022 archaeologists from the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw announced the discovery of a 45
00 yearold temple dedicated to the Egyptian sun god Ra. The recently discovered sun temple was made from mud bricks and was about 60 meters long by 20 m wide. According to Massimiliano Nuzzolo codirector of the excavation storage rooms and other rooms may have been served for cultic purposes and the walls of the building were all plastered in black and white. The Lshaped entrance portico had two limestone columns and was partly made of white limestone. Dozens of wellpreserved beer jars and several wellmade and redlined vessels seal impressions including seals of the pharaohs who ruled during the fifth and sixth dynasties were also uncovered. One of the earliest seals might belonged to pharaoh Shepseskare who ruled Egypt before Nyuserre.88 Bias in Egyptologyedit Various scholars have highlighted the role of colonial racism in shaping the attitudes of early Egyptologists and criticised the continued overrepresentation of North American and European perspectives in the field.8990919293 Cheikh Anta Diop in his work The African Origin of Civilization argued that the prevailing views in Egyptology were driven by biased scholarship and colonial attitudes.9495 Similarly Bruce Trigger wrote that early modern scholarship on the Nile Valley populations had been marred by a confusion of race language and culture and by an accompanying racism.96 British Africanist Basil Davidson wrote in 1995 that a number of unsatisfactory labels are often attachedsuch as Bushmen Negro or Negroidto indigenous African populations. He was also critical of the Hamitic hypothesis and other categorisations of North African stocks as white. Davidson further added that the ancient Egyptians belonged that is not to any specific Egyptian region or Near Eastern heritage but to that wide community of peoples who lived between the Red Sea and the Atlantic Ocean shared a common SaharanSudanese culture and drew their reinforcements from the same great source even though as time went by they also absorbed a number of wanderers from the Near East.97 In 2018 Stuart Tyson Smith argued that a common practice among Egyptologists was to divorce Egypt from its proper northeast African context instead framing it as fundamentally part of a Near Eastern or Mediterranean economic social and political sphere hardly African at all or at best a crossroad between the Near East the eastern Mediterranean and Africa which carries with it the implication that it is ultimately not really part of Africa. He explicitly criticised the view that ancient Egypt was clearly in Africa it was not so clearly of Africa as reflecting longstanding Egyptological biases. He concluded that the interrelated cultural features shared between northeast African dynamic and Pharaonic Egypt are not survivals or coincidence but shared traditions with common origins in the deep past.98 In 2021 Marc Van De Mieroop stated that It was only recently that traditional scholarship started to acknowledge the African background of Egyptian culture partly in response to world historys aim to replace dominant westerncentered narratives with others than focused more on the contributions of other regions including Africa. At the same time primarily African diaspora communities wanted the continents ancient history to be approached outside a Eurocentric context and insisted for example on the use of ancient Egyptian term kemet instead of the European one.99 In 2022 Andrea Manzo argued that early Egyptologists had situated the origins of dynastic Egypt within a broad Hamitic horizon that characterised several regions of Africa and that these views had continued to dominate in the second half of the twentieth century. Manzo stated more recent studies had pointed out the relevance of African elements to the rise of Egyptian culture following earlier suggestions on Egyptian kingship and religion by Henri Frankfort which countered the traditional view that considered Egypt more closely linked to the Near East than to the rest of Africa.100 In 2023 Christopher Ehret outlined that the previous two centuries of Western scholarship had presented Egypt as an offshoot of earlier Middle Eastern developments. Although he acknowledged that recent generations of scholars in Egypt and Nubia have been uncovering extensive new bodies of evidence which have dispelled older assumptions. However Ehret continued to argue that these old ideas had influenced the attitudes of scholars in other disciplines such as genetics. Ehret reported that the physical anthropological findings from the major burial sites of those founding locales of ancient Egypt in the fourth millennium BCE notably ElBadari as well as Naqada show no demographic indebtedness to the Levant. Ehret specified that these studies revealed cranial and dental affinities with closest parallels to other longtime populations in the surrounding areas of Northeastern Africa such as Nubia and the northern Horn of Africa. He further commented that the Naqada and Badarian populations did not migrate from somewhere else but were descendants of the longterm inhabitants of these portions of Africa going back many millennia. Ehret also cited supporting archaeological and linguistic evidence which situated ancient Egypt in a northeastern African context.101 Academic disciplineedit Egyptology was established as an academic discipline through the research of Ippolito Rosellini in Italy Emmanuel de Roug in France Samuel Birch in England and Heinrich Brugsch in Germany. In 1880 Flinders Petrie another British Egyptologist revolutionised the field of archaeology through controlled and scientifically recorded excavations. Petries work determined that Egyptian culture dated back as early as 4500 BC. The British Egypt Exploration Fund founded in 1882 and other Egyptologists promoted Petries methods. Other scholars worked on producing a hieroglyphic dictionary developing a Demotic lexicon and establishing an outline of ancient Egyptian history.8 In the United States the founding of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago and the expedition of James Henry Breasted to Egypt and Nubia established Egyptology as a legitimate field of study. In 1924 Breasted also started the Epigraphic Survey to make and publish accurate copies of monuments. In the late 
19 th and early 
20 th century the Metropolitan Museum of Art the University of Pennsylvania the Museum of Fine Arts Boston the Brooklyn Institute of Fine Arts and the Institute of Fine Arts New York University also conducted excavations in Egypt expanding American collections.8 In 1999 under the leadership of Prof. Ioannis Liritzis Egyptology was introduced as an academic discipline in Greece specifically in the Department of Mediterranean Studies DMS of the University of the Aegean.102103104105106 Beginning in 1998 Prof. Liritzis has collaborated with Egyptian authorities to encourage research fieldwork and education all supported by Greek and European funding.106107108109 The HellenicEgyptian relationship in Egyptological studies has been successful largely due to Prof. Liritzis and the result is a plethora of publications and interactions.110111109112 Some universities and colleges offer degrees in Egyptology. In the United States these include the University of Chicago Brown University New York University Yale University and Indiana University  Bloomington and California State University San Bernardino. There are also many programmes in the United Kingdom including those at the University of Oxford the University of Cambridge Swansea University the University of Liverpool the University of Manchester and the University of London. While Egyptology is widely studied in continental Europe113 only twoLeiden University and Uppsala Universityoffer degree programs taught in English.114 The professional organisation of scholars in Egyptology is the International Association of Egyptologists IAE under whose auspices an International Congress of Egyptologists ICE is held every four years. Societies for Egyptology include The Society for the Study of Ancient Egypt115 The Society for the Study of Ancient Egyptian Antiquities Canada116 Sussex Egyptology Society Online117 Egypt Exploration Society118 According to UCLA the standard text that scholars referenced for studies of Egyptology was for three decades or more the Lexikon der gyptologie L. The first volume published in 1975 containing largely Germanlanguage articles with a few in English and French.119 See alsoedit Archaeology of Ancient Egypt Artifact archaeology Assyriology Coptology Cultural tourism in Egypt Egyptomania Ethnoarchaeology Excavation archaeology Iranology List of Egyptologists Nubiology Referencesedit   Greg Reeder Archived 23 September 2010 at the Wayback Machine retrieved GMT23

Thompson 2015 p. 85 Ancient and modern Egypt became easier to conceptualize because of the prolific French cartographer JeanBaptiste Bourguignon dAnville 16971782. The greatest mapmaker of his age Bourguignon dAnville also had a special interest in ancient geography one that he wrote would not permit me to neglect Egypt this country so celebrated in antiquity. Instead of copying older maps and blindly replicating their errors and speculations as had long been the practice he sought reliable data and was content to leave spaces blank rather than fill them with conjectural features. He had no firsthand experience with Egypt but he carefully pored over every available source modern ancient and Arab as he explained in his Memoires sur lEgypte ancienne et moderne 1766. Bourguignon dAnvilles map of Egypt allowed readers to see the relationship of ancient and modern sites much more clearly than before. It continued in use well into the nineteenth century. Although the cartographers of Napoleons Egyptian expedition made a more accurate map it was declared a state secret and Bourguignon dAnvilles map was printed in its place in the great Description de lEgypte.  a b c Egyptology PDF.
