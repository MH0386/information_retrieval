Roxana Marriage of Alexander and Roxana by Il Sodoma Born Bactria Died 310 BC Amphipolis Macedon Ancient Greece Spouse Alexander the Great Issue Alexander IV Father Oxyartes Religion Zoroastrianism Roxana dead 310 BC1 Ancient Greek  Old Iranian Raxn shining radiant brilliant sometimes Roxanne Roxanna Rukhsana Roxandra and Roxane was a Sogdian23 or a Bactrian4 princess who Alexander the Great married after defeating Darius ruler of the Achaemenid Empire and invading Persia. The exact date of her birth is unknown but she was probably in her early teens at the time of her wedding. Alexander the Great and Roxana a 1756 painting by Pietro Rotari. The Wedding of Alexander and Roxane 18981899 an engraving by Andr Castaigne. Biographyedit Roxana was born as the daughter of a Bactrian nobleman named Oxyartes who served Bessus the satrap of Bactria and Sogdia.1 He was thus probably also involved in the murder of the last Achaemenid king Darius III. After Bessus was captured by the Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great Oxyartes and his family continued to resist the Macedonians and along with other notables such as the Sogdian warlord Spitamenes took up a defensive position in a fortress known as the Sogdian Rock.5 They were eventually defeated by Alexander who attended a celebration6 and reportedly fell in love with Roxana on sight.7 The location of the celebration took place is disputed6 possibly in the Sogdian Rock or another fortress of Chorienes also called Sisimithres by Quintus Rufus Curtius but according to the Metz Epitome it was in the house of Chorienes in which Roxana was introduced to Alexander as the daughter of Oxyartes.86 Curtius apparently misrepresented Roxana as a daughter of Chorienes.6 Arrian states that Oxyartes surrendered to Alexander when he became aware of the good reception Alexander awarded his daughter Roxana.6 A.B. Bosworth mentions the possibility of Roxana being captured at the Sogdian Rock but that the two married at the fortress of Chorienes.6 The marriage was in 327 BC and according to the majority of the sources it was in the Macedonian rite rather than the Persian.9 Alexander married Roxana despite opposition from his companions109 who would have preferred a Macedonian or other Greek to become queen.11 However the marriage was also politically advantageous as it made the Sogdian army more loyal towards Alexander and less rebellious after their defeat.12 Alexander thereafter made an expedition into India and while there he appointed Oxyartes as the governor of the Hindu Kush region adjoining India.1 Roxana accompanied Alexander into India where her first son died at or soon after birth near the banks of the Acesines River 13 in November 326 BC. When Alexander returned to Susa in spring 324 BC he promoted a brother of Roxana to the elite cavalry.51 To encourage a better acceptance of his government among the Persians Alexander also married Stateira II the daughter of the deposed Persian king Darius III.1 After Alexanders sudden death at Babylon in 323 BC Roxana is believed to have murdered Stateira. According to Plutarch she also had Stateiras sister Drypetis murdered with the consent of Perdiccas.14 Roxana was pregnant which caused some discussions between Alexanders loyalists around Perdiccas15 and Ptolemy16 who suggested waiting to see if Alexanders posthumous child was a son and naming either a caretaker regent or a council to govern on his behalf and the Macedonian soldiers who opposed a socalled persianization of the Macedonian court.15 For the Macedonian succession a temporary compromise was found as Philip Arrhidaeus was declared king of Macedon if the unborn child was a son he was to become a king as well.17 By 317 though Roxanas son called Alexander IV lost his kingship as a result of intrigues started by Philip Arrhidaeus wife Eurydice II.1 Afterwards Roxana and the young Alexander were protected by Alexander the Greats mother Olympias in Macedonia.18 Following Olympias assassination in 316 BC Cassander imprisoned Roxana and her son in the citadel of Amphipolis.19 Their detention was condemned by the Macedonian general Antigonus in 315 BC.20 In 311 BC a peace treaty between Antigonus and Cassander confirmed the kingship of Alexander IV but also Cassander as his guardian20 following which the Macedonians demanded his release.21 However Cassander ordered Glaucias of Macedon to kill Alexander and Roxana.22 It is assumed that they were murdered in spring 310 BC but their death was concealed until the summer.23 The two were killed after Heracles a son of Alexander the Greats mistress Barsine was murdered bringing the Argead dynasty to an end.19 Legacyedit Asteroid 317 Roxane is named in her honor.24 At the Acropolis there were found inscriptions of offerings Roxana shall have dedicated as Alexanders wife to Athena.25 Lucian describes a painting of Roxanas marriage to Alexander by the Greek painter Echion also known as Aetion which won the painter the consent of the Olympic Hellanodike Proxenidas to marry his daughter.25 In one of the versions of the Alexander Romances Darius III is her father and dying gives his consent to the marriage in which she wears the royal jewelry Alexander had asked for at his mother Olympias. The marriage takes then place in Darius palace.25 See alsoedit Alexandre et Roxane an opera that Mozart planned to write Ancient history of Afghanistan Balkh Roshanak Global Royal intermarriage Referencesedit  a b c d e f Badian Ernst.
