18 th Dynasty white background style Ancient Egyptian pottery includes all objects of fired clay from ancient Egypt.1 First and foremost ceramics served as household wares for the storage preparation transport and consumption of food drink and raw materials. Such items include beer and wine mugs and water jugs but also bread moulds fire pits lamps and stands for holding round vessels which were all commonly used in the Egyptian household. Other types of pottery served ritual purposes. Ceramics are often found as grave goods. Specialists in ancient Egyptian pottery draw a fundamental distinction between ceramics made of Nile clay and those made of marl clay based on chemical and mineralogical composition and ceramic properties. Nile clay is the result of eroded material in the Ethiopian mountains which was transported into Egypt by the Nile. This clay has deposited on the banks of the Nile in Egypt since the Late Pleistocene by the flooding of the Nile. Marl clay is a yellowwhite stone which occurs in limestone deposits. These deposits were created in the Pleistocene when the primordial waters of the Nile and its tributaries brought sediment into Egypt and deposited in on what was then the desert edge. Our understanding of the nature and organisation of ancient Egyptian pottery manufacture is based on tomb paintings models and archaeological remains of pottery workshops. A characteristic of the development of Egyptian ceramics is that the new methods of production which were developed over time never entirely replaced older methods but expanded the repertoire instead so that eventually each group of objects had its own manufacturing technique. Egyptian potters employed a wide variety of decoration techniques and motifs most of which are associated with specific periods of time such as the creation of unusual shapes decoration with incisions various different firing processes and painting techniques. An important classification system for Egyptian pottery is the Vienna system which was developed by Dorothea Arnold Manfred Bietak Janine Bourriau Helen and Jean Jacquet and Hanske Nordstrm at a meeting in Vienna in 1980. Seriation of Egyptian pottery has proven useful for the relative chronology of ancient Egypt. This method was invented by Flinders Petrie in 1899. It is based on the changes of vessel types and the proliferation and decline of different types over time. Materialedit Understanding of the raw material is essential for understanding the development production and typology of Egyptian ceramics. In Egyptian archaeology the distinction between Nile clay and marl clay is fundamental. Mixtures of the two types of clay can be seen as a third group.2 Nile clayedit Glazed vessel made from Nile clay with white painted details White Crosslined style Nile clay is the result of eroded material in the Ethiopian mountains which was transported into Egypt by the Nile. This clay was deposited on the banks of the Nile in Egypt since the Late Pleistocene by the cyclic Nile floods. As a result deposits can be found far from the modern floodplain as well as within the level covered by the flood in modern times. Chemically the clay is characterised by high silicon content and a high level of iron oxide. Mineralogically it is micacaeous illiterich sediment clay containing many different sand and stone particles brought from the various contexts through which the Nile flows.23 The clay turns a red or brown colour when it is fired in an oxygenrich oven. When unfired it varies in colour from grey to nearly black.4 Marl clayedit Cylinder vessel made from marl clay from the 
1 st dynasty The marl clay or desert clay is found along the Nile valley from Esna to Cairo in the oases and at the edges of the Nile Delta. It is a yellowwhite stone which is found in limestone deposits. The deposits were created in the Pleistocene when the original Nile river and its tributaries deposited this clay in what had previously been desert.5 Marl clay includes a range of kinds of clay based on their base substance. In general they have a lower percentage of silica and significantly higher calcium content.6 The most important subtypes of marl clay are4 Qena clay secondary deposits like that at Wadi Qena. This clay comes from sediments which were washed down the wadi and mixed with local slate and limestone. Marl clay from slate and limestone which is found along the Nile between Esna and Cairo. Marl clay is normally cream or white in colour when it is fired in an oxygenrich oven. Cuts can reveal pink or orange areas. It is rich in mineral salts so the outer surface often has a thin layer of weathered salt which forms a white surface layer when fired which can be mistaken for a glaze by the unwary. At higher firing temperature c. 1000 C this layer becomes olivegreen and resembles a green glaze.7 Dry clayfilled Nile mud in an area near Karima Sudan which is flooded annually. Mineral clay after collection Productionedit Depiction of ceramic production in the Old Kingdom Mastaba of Ti Selection of materialedit The selection of material was based on local conditions and the function of the object being manufactured. Nile clay was principally used for household crockery and containers as well as ceramics for ritual use. Marl clay was principally used for storage and prestige objects like figural vessels.8 Gathering the clayedit There is little precise information on how and where Egyptian potters got their raw material how clay pits were run how it was transported and how it was assigned to individual potters.8 In general it seems that the clay came from three different places the shore of the Nile or irrigation canals the desert near the fields and the hills of the desert itself. A depiction in the tomb of Rekhmire TT100 shows workers in the process of building up pile of Nile mud with hoes in order to make mudbricks. Clay for pottery production might have been gathered in a similar way. The scene also shows that Nile clay did not absolutely have to be taken from the fields. Piles of Nile clay were built up in the process of digging irrigation canals  as still happens today.9 Gathering Nile mud in order to make mudbricks. Use of hoes to gather loess in Tibet photo from 1938 Preparation of the clayedit Working up the clay in an image in a tomb in Beni Hasan from the Middle Kingdom Tomb of Baket III. Kneading the clay Beni Hasan Tomb of Baket III Egyptian tomb paintings often show the preparation of the clay. There are also models which provide some other details. Clear archaeological remains of pottery workshops however are rare. It is possible that they were very ephemeral structures.8 Clay which is exposed to air dries very quickly. As a result clay often reached the potter as dry stony clumps especially the marl clay from the desert which first had to be cleaned and mixed with water in order to make it possible to shape it.10 The raw clay was also dried and crushed in order to remove any large impurities like stones by passing it through a sieve. Another possibility was the elutriation of the clay by repeatedly immersing hard clay pellets in water and skimming the fine clay off the top. There is no evidence for such a process in the pottery workshop in Ayn Asil Dakhla Oasis11 but there is some possible evidence at Hieraconpolis.12 This elutriation would have to have been carried out in one or more pits or watering holes. Even before these finds the depictions of potters in the tomb of Kenamun de TT93 had been interpreted as depicting elutriation in a watering hole. At least for the clay used in Meidumware in the Old Kingdom and the remarkably homogeneous Nile clay used from the beginning of the 
18 th dynasty some kind of refining technology must have been used.13 Standard images show one or two men involved in preparing the clay once they had softened it by treading it with their feet in order to turn it into a malleable mass. At this stage the clay might be supplemented with temper if it was decided that it did not already contain sufficient fine impurities like sand. It was important that these not be too big or sharp excessively large temper can make the walls of pottery vessels unstable since the clay will not be able to mesh together properly. Sharp particles like stones could hurt the potter when kneading the clay and forming the vessels and prevent the creation of a smooth surface. Through the addition of balanced temper the clay could be made more malleable and stable during production and also more porous which made it easier to dry bake and use the finished vessel.14 After the clay had been mixed with water it would be full of air bubbles. To prevent cracking during the firing process the clay had to be kneaded. In this process two halves of a lump of clay were beaten against one another with significant force. In the tomb paintings a worker in a bent position is shown working the clay with his hands before handing the kneaded balls directly over to the potter.15 Shapingedit There were five different techniques for shaping clay in ancient Egypt16 by hand using a rotatable pilaster using a potters wheel operated by one of the potters hands using a mould on a rapidly spinning potters wheel operated by an assistant or the potters foot. Characteristic of the development of ceramics is that although new methods were developed over time they never entirely replaced older ones. Rather they expanded the repertoire so that at the high point in the history of Egyptian pottery each type of object had its own manufacturing technique. Handshapingedit Hopi woman making clay coil pottery photo from 1899 There were several different techniques for making pottery by hand stacking a number of coils on a flat clay base weaving and free modelling. These three techniques were used from the predynastic period until at least the Old Kingdom.16 Free modelling by kneading and pulling at the clay with the hands is the oldest and most enduring technique for shaping clay. It was employed for all vessels in the Faiyum A culture in the Merimde culture and probably also in the Badari culture. In the Old Kingdom it was used for the most important types and it was used for figures and models in all periods.17 The resulting product had thick walls. The technique is recognisable by pressure marks where individual bits of clay have been pressed together.16 In the weaving technique flat rectangular pieces of clay were woven together. The technique can be recognised by the fact that the broken vessels tend to form rectangular sherds. The technique seems to have come into widespread use in early Egypt from the time when larger pottery vessels began to be made at the latest. Throughout the whole Pharaonic period and down to Roman times large basins and tubs were made using this technique.81618 In the clay coil method a series of coils of clay were stacked one on top of the other to form the walls of a pot. This technique is seen in late predynastic pottery from Heliopolis.81619 Rotating pilasteredit Creation of a vase using a rotating pedestal from a depiction in the Mastaba of Ti During the Chalcolithic the rotating pilaster came into use for the manufacture of ceramics. This may have arisen from the desire to make the body and especially the opening of the vessel being made symmetrical. The technique can be clearly recognised from a horizontal rotation mark in the opening of the vessel.16 Unlike the potters wheel there was no fixed axis around which rotations were centred.20 The pilaster used in this technique could by a bowl plate basket mat textile or even a pottery sherd. This pilaster was rotated along with the vessel as the potter shaped it. The rotation technique was used only for the creation of the vessels shell. The earlier techniques were also used for other parts of the manufacturing process. Thus on finished vessels traces of free modelling are found especially in the lower parts but the edges were turned after the completion of the whole vessel.816 Handoperated potters wheeledit An important advance was the invention of the potters wheel which rotated on a central axis. This enabled the potter to rotate the wheel and the vessel with one hand while shaping the vessel with the other hand.21 According to Dorothea Arnold the slow potters wheel was invented some time during the Fourth Dynasty.22 Eva Christiana Khler de has subsequently argued that this should be corrected to a substantially earlier period the invention of the potters wheel is a development which generally accompanied a certain form of massproduction. It enabled standardisation and the rapid production of finished vessels.21 According to her this development can clearly be traced back to the massproduced conical bowls of the Mesopotamian Uruk culture at Habuba Kabira.23 In production first a large clay cone was shaped on the disc. The peak of the cone was the actual point of rotation around which the bowl was to be formed. It was then sliced off with a wire or a cord. The resulting bowls had a relatively thick wall near the base and marks from rotation and pulling on the underside of the base. Christiana Khler detected such marks on vessels of the predynastic period which makes it fairly likely that the slow potters wheel was in use in this period.21 Creation of a vessel on a handoperated potters wheel Swiveling potters wheel Creation of potter with a potters wheel in Indonesia c. 1930 Moldedit It is assumed that baking pans for conical bread were made with the help of a mold. It is possible that they were shaped around a conical wooden core which had the shape of the conical bread which would eventually be baked in the pans.21 Fast potters wheeledit Depiction of ceramic production from the New Kingdom grave of Kenamun. Manufacture on the fast potters wheel operated by an assistant or the foot of the potter was a relatively late development which took place in the New Kingdom at the earliest. The earliest depiction comes from the Tomb of Kenamun from the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty in which an assistant grips the wheel and thereby helps the potter to use the wheel while the potter himself uses his foot to stabilise it.24 Surface treatmentedit Shaping the round base of a bowl in a depiction from Beni Hasan Scraping away excess clay on the base of a pottery vessel. Photo of ceramic production in Liberia in 1968. The shaped vessel first had to be dried enough that the walls would be stable for further work. The clay was brought to roughly the consistency of leather remaining damp enough that it could still be moulded and shaped. At this point paint glaze and slip could be added if desired. After further drying the vessel was polished.25 There were two techniques for polishing the vessels surface17 Polishing by rubbing without pressure produced a consistent light sheen. Examples include jugs from the Old Kingdom jugs and dishes from the First Intermediate Period and possibly the Middle Kingdom. Polishing with a burnish or significant pressure on the vessels surface. This results in very shiny surfaces but only in rare cases of especially careful work such as Meidum bowls of the Old Kingdom are no polishing marks left behind. In the Thinis period and the Seventeenth and Eighteenth dynasties potters made decorative patterns with the marks left by this polishing process. At this stage impressions or incisions could also be made in the clay when the clay was still damp enough that it would not break in the process but was dry enough that no raised areas would be left in the incisions. This was done with various tools including bone or wooden nails combs made from bone or shellfish and flint knives.25 After an initial drying phase the round base was finished. This was done by hand until the seventeenth dynasty using a flat tool to cut and smooth the base. A foot was also cut by hand or molded from an additional lump of clay. After the beginning of the seventeenth dynasty the foot was instead made on the potters wheel from the mass of clay used for the creation of the base of the vessel. At this point bases and stands increasingly have rotation marks on the outside.26 Dryingedit In the drying process the vessel had to be kept under controlled conditions such that all parts of the vessel dried equally and no shrinking took place.27 In this process a lot of water had to evaporate since the remaining water would boil at the beginning of the firing process which led the water vapour to expand in volume leading to explosions if it could not escape.28 The vessel was left to dry in direct sunlight when the light was weak in the shade when it was strong or in a closed room when it was raining or cold. The drying process could take several days depending on the humidity the size wallthickness and porosity of the vessel. Even when drying was complete vessels remained between 35 saturated with water which was only expelled during the firing process.25 Firingedit Firing pottery on an open fire in a village on the Niger in Mali photo from 2009. Reconstruction of a kiln in Thebes New Kingdom In the firing process the clay is transformed from a malleable material to a rigid one. Up to this point it is possible to make the clay malleable again by making it wet. After firing damaged vessels like misfirings are nearly unfixable.29 In order for the transformation of the clay into this final and moistureless form it must be heated to a temperature of 550600 C. Before this at around 100 C residual moisture escapes into the air and at 300 C the chemically bonded water of crystallization also escapes. The supply of oxygen during the firing process is critical since it is used up as the fuel is burnt. If more is not supplied e.g. through a vent an atmosphere rich in carbon monoxide or free carbon will develop and it will create a black or brownblack ironII oxide which gives the fired pottery a grey or dark brown colour. This is called a reducing firing. In an oxidating firing by contrast a continuous supply of oxygen is maintained. The iron in the clay absorbs oxygen and becomes the red or redbrown ironIII oxide. The resulting pottery has a redbrown colour.25 The simplest and earliest firing method is the open fire. The vessel to be fired is covered and filled with flammable material. It is placed on a flat piece of ground surrounded by a low wall or put in a pit. During the firing process the potter has relatively little control. The vessel is in direct contact with the flames and the fuel which heats quickly and then cools down again quickly.2529 Optimisation of the firing process became possible once the pottery was placed inside a chamber with a vent and separated from the fuel of the fire i.e. a kiln. This technological leap was made in the early Old Kingdom at the latest but possibly in the Early Dynastic or late Predynastic period.30 The simplest form of a kiln was a shaft with no separation of the area where the fuel was burnt from the chamber where the ceramics were placed. This could be loaded through a shaft and then set on fire through an opening on the ground. This opening enabled a continuous supply of oxygen which could be used to create an oxidising atmosphere. The oven now had to reach a set firing temperature in order to heat the clay in the firing chamber. As a result the fire lasted longer and burnt more consistently.30 The next technological advance was the introduction of a grating which separated the fuel from the pottery being fired. This prevented smoky flames and carbonised fuel from coming in contact with the ceramics and leaving flecks and smudges on it.30 The vessels being fired were placed in the upper part with the opening underneath. The hot air rose up to the vessels and circulated around them indirectly firing the clay.31 Shaft ovens of this type with a grating are attested in Egyptian art and by archaeology from the Old Kingdom onwards.

There are three points in the manufacturing process in which decoration could be added before during or after the firing process. Since the predynastic period potters added decorative elements in the molding stage creating unusual shapes or imitating other materials like basketwork metal wood or stone. The majority of the fancy features32 were created during the process of shaping the vessel and smoothing its surfaces long before it was fired. The elements were either shaped from a piece of clay by hand or impressed into the clay while it was still malleable  often causing fingerprints to be left on the inside of the vessel. In figural vessels these were often parts of a human or animal body or the face of the god Bes or the goddess Hathor. It was also common to cut out parts of the vessel in order to imitate another type of material.33 Even in the earliest Egyptian pottery produced by an early phase of the Merimde culture there are incised decorations like the herringbone pattern. In this technique the surface of the pot was scratched with a sharp instrument like a twig knife nail or fingernail before it was fired.34 Pots fired in a firing pit often have a black upper rim. These black rims were increasingly a decorative feature which required technical knowledge to produce consistently. In combination with a darkred colour and polish this blacktopped ware was one of the most fashionable and popular types of pottery. The black colour was a result of carbonisation created by the introduction of smoke particles to the oven during the firing process for example. Some aspects of this special process are still unclear.35 Painted decoration could be added with a brush before or after firing. For specific patters paint might be sprayed on the surface of a vessel or it might be dipped in the paint. There are eight major types of painted pottery from ancient Egypt36 Petries whitecrosslined style this pottery is found only in Upper Egypt in the Naqada I culture c. 40003500 BC. It s usually made from Nile clay Nile clay A. The surface is a dark red or reddish brown and is polished. The characteristic feature of this style is the white or cream coloured painting of geometric patterns or occasionally animals plants people and boats. Petries decorated style this pottery is typical of the Naqada II and Naqada III cultures c. 35003000 BC. It is usually made of marl clay marl clay A1. The surface is thoroughly smoothed but not polished and its colour varies from light red to yellowy grey. Redbrown paint was used to paint a number of motifs  most commonly ships deserts flamingos people spirals wavy lines and Zshaped lines. White background style this style was made in the First Intermediate Period early Middle Kingdom New Kingdom and the Late Period c. 2200300 BC. The surfaces of this style were decorated with various colours on a white background after firing. The decoration normally depicts carefully designed offering scenes. The scenic style this style occurred sporadically in all periods. It is very similar to the white background style except that the scenes were painted directly onto the surface of the vessel without a white background. The bluepainted style this style occurred from the middle of the 
18 th dynasty until the end of the 
20 th Dynasty c. 15001000 BC. It is characterised by the use of blue pigments along with black red and occasionally yellow. The main motif is floral decorations lotus flowers and buds and individual petals of various flowers painted as if they were on a thread draped around the neck and shoulders of the vase. Depictions of young animals and symbols of Hathor and Bes are also encountered. The vessels are usually made of Nile clay. The brownandred painted style this style developed at the beginning of the 
18 th Dynasty c. 1500 BC from the decorative use of lines in the late Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate period. Unlike the bluepainted style this pottery is usually made from marl clay. The style is characterised by very specific decorative patters a group of two to four parallel lines with various elements like dots zigzag lines wavy lines and the like painted in between them. These were painted in different colours either brown elements and red lines or vice versa. The lotusflowerandcrosslinedband style.

Depiction of wine production in the tomb of Nakht TT52 with typical wine jugs Wine jugs from Abydos early dynastic. In Egyptology the term pottery is used to refer to all nonfigural objects made from fired clay. The majority of pottery vessels surely served as household wares and were used for the storage preparation transport and consumption of food and other raw materials. In addition to this there were other objects frequently used in the household like bread moulds fireboxes lamps and stands for vessels with round bases. Other types of pottery served ritual purposes. Sometimes water pipes were constructed from amphorae laid backtoback but actual ceramic water pipes were only introduced in the Roman period. Musical instruments like rattles could also be made from ceramics in the form of bottles filled with pebbles and then sealed before being fired.3738 Evidence for the function of individual pottery types is given by depictions in tombs textual descriptions their shape and design remains of their contents and the archaeological context in which they are found. In tombs pottery is often only sketched out schematically. Nevertheless in some cases it is possible to identify the function of a vessel based on depictions in tombs. Examples include bread molds spinning weights and beer jugs. The shapes of beer jugs make it possible to link them with scenes of beer manufacture such as the Mastaba of Ti they are ovoid roundbodied bottles often with weakly defined lips which are generally roughly shaped and are made of clay with a lot of organic matter mixed in.3839 Inscriptions giving the contents of the vessel are not unusual in the New Kingdom. As a result wine jugs and fish kettles can be identified although wine jugs were also used for other raw materials like oil and honey. One of the largest finds of inscribed wine vessels came from the tomb of Tutankhamun KV62. The inscriptions on the 26 inscribed wine jugs provide more information about the wine they contain than most modern wine labels. The year of the lees was recorded in the kings regnal years. The quality the origin of the grapes the owner of the winery and the name of the vintner who was responsible for the actual product were all recorded.40 See also Wine in ancient Egypt de. The vessels themselves provide evidence for their purpose for example by the type of clay used the treatment of the outer surface and the shape of the vessel. Among the significant factors is whether porosity was desirable or not. Thus in modern water jugs like zirs and gullas the water seeps through the walls so that the contents can be cooled through evaporation.41 This effect can be best achieved with a bright clay or coating. Thus Christiana Khler in her study of the Early dynastic pottery from Buto was able to identify bottles or jugs with a white coating or light largegrained marl clay as water containers. An opposite effect could be created with a dark overcoat. By this the pores of the outer surface were filled and the walls of the vessel were made impermeable to liquids. This made a vessel lowmaintenance and hygienic since no lowgrade food residue would sick to the walls of the vessel. This can be seen since no drink and food trays and plates can be detected.39 Social context of productionedit Statue of a potter The place of the ceramic industry in the wider social and economic context of ancient Egyptian society has been treated only cursorily in research to date.42 Tomb decorations and pottery models provide only a few pieces of evidence for the context of pottery production. Depictions from the Old Kingdom are closely linked with brewery and bakery scenes although these are also depicted separately at times. This indicates that pottery production was an independent part of food production. However the inhabitants of tombs desired food and drink in the afterlife not empty vessels.43 Models of pottery workshops from the First Intermediate period and the Middle Kingdom give only a little indication of where the production took place. In all cases they are depicted in the open air  sometimes in a courtyard. More information is offered by the Middle Kingdom scenes in the tombs at Beni Hasan. Here pottery production is shown taking place alongside other crafts like carpentry metalworking textile production and the manufacturing of stone vases  and much less frequently with food production. This trend continues in the only depictions we have from the New Kingdom in the tomb of Kenamun in Thebes.44 The models only ever show one or two men at work which might indicate that production was carried out on a small scale. In almost all depictions the works are male. There are a few examples from the Old Kingdom of women participating in the production process e.g. helping to load the kiln. Little is known about the individual workers but they were surely of low social status. That they were not part of higher society is also indicated by the absence of epigraphic evidence for this vocation.44 This is also illustrated by the Satire of the Occupations The potter is beneath the earth although his lifetime is beneath the living. He rummages in the mud more than pigs in order to burn his pots. His loincloth is stiff from the clay his belt is a rag. The air in his nose actually comes from his kiln. Satire of the Trades45 The ramheaded potter god Khnum makes the divine child Ihy Horusthe king on a potters wheel and IsisHathor fills him with life. On the other hand pottery production had an important place in Egyptian culture. As part of everyday life it belonged to a level where perfection did not matter. From that point of view it was less about social stratification than about a stratification of the value which people attach to things.46 It would therefore be wrong to say that Egyptian potters were despised. There was a strong sense that the process was a creative one. Thus the word for potter qd is the same one used for building walls and structures. Even the activities of creator gods were depicted using the image of the potter. The ramheaded creator god Khnum was shown creating gods men animals and plants on the potters wheel. This suggests high esteem for ceramic production.47 Stephan Seidlmayer de investigated the social and organisational circumstances of pottery production in the transitional period from the Old Kingdom to the Middle Kingdom asking how the archaeological evidence can be connected to the image of the historical situation which we have built up from other sources. He concludes that the economic situation in the Old Kingdom favoured a centralised standardised and specialised production in great quantities using complicated procedures. The organisational capacity of the state enabled focused production with highquality pottery suitable for storage and transport in the context of the extensive distribution of goods by a centralised system. In the late Old Kingdom and the First Intermediate period the centralised system deteriorated. It was replaced by decentralised production in small quantities for the circulation of goods within relatively small areas. In order to achieve high output it was necessary to compromise on the quality of the wares. The profound transformation of the archaeological material indicates the extent of the social transformation which affected the whole cultural system at this time.48 Economic context of productionedit Reconstruction of a pottery workshop from AynAsil of the First Intermediate Period E. Christiana Khler has shown that a nonindustrial system of pottery production based in individual households developed in late predynastic Buto in particular as a result of the unfavourable climatic conditions of the Nile delta. At the same time specialisation can already be seen in pottery production in the late Naqada I and early Naqada II cultures in Upper Egypt where the typical pottery found in settlements is a simple tempered weak Nileclay pottery Rough ware. However the typical red ware for cemeteries the Redpolished and Blacktopped ware was made entirely differently whereas the rough ware of the settlements was fired at only c. 500800 C temperatures of up to 1000 C were used for the red wares. Although the red ware had a finegrained thick fabric it was only occasionally tempered and it required a controlled firing process. This situation suggests that two different systems of manufacture already existed a professional specialised industry making funerary pottery and household production of rough wares.49 The environment of Upper Egypt seems to have been more conducive to specialised pottery production. In densely settled areas like Hierakonpolis and Naqada there was also heavy demand for pottery. In the course of Naqada II a society developed in Upper Egypt which placed significant value in their burials and the grave goods that they included in them so that the demand for highvalue pottery quickly increased. Only for funerary pottery does there seem to have been any demand for professional pottery since the fine wares are regularly found in graves and very rarely in settlement contexts.50 The best archaeological evidence for pottery production is provided by kilns51 Even in the predynastic period pottery production in Hierakonpolis had reached amazing heights. Fifteen kiln complexes have been identified. The excavated kilns are not very technologically advanced but they produced at least three different kinds of ware in many different forms for both household and funerary use.52 In the late 
5 th or early 
6 th Dynasty pottery was manufactured in the Mortuary temple of the Pyramid of Khentkaus II in Abusir. It was a small worship dated rather later than the actual establishment. Inside the temple there was a manufacturing area a storage space and a kiln. Possibly vessels were manufactured here for cult purposes.53 Near the mortuary temple of Menkaure at Giza an industrial area has been excavated which included kilns. Mark Lehner also identified possible locations for the mixing of the clay. All food production and pottery production was subordinate to worship.54 In Elephantine there were kilns outside the walls of the city which were established in the Old Kingdom. They date to the middle of the 
4 th C BC through to the early 
5 th century BC and were part of a substantial industry.55 The best example of a workshop in a settlement context comes from Ayn Asil in the Dakhla Oasis. These workshops produced pottery from the end of the Old Kingdom into the First Intermediate Period and were located outside the settlements walls like the kilns in Elephantine. It is estimated that they were operated by teams of five to ten workers working with a wide variety of clays and producing a number of different forms. The presence of bread moulds in these workshops led the excavators to conclude that there was no household pottery production in the community since these would be the most likely things to be produced in individual households. However not all the citys needs were met by this production and only a little locally produced pottery was found in the citys cemetery.56 In Nag elBaba in Nubia a pottery workshop has been uncovered which was active from the 
12 th Dynasty to the Second Intermediate Period. It was a compound with several rooms including some for the preparation of the clay and one with a simple oven. Some tools were also identified including probable fragments of a potters wheel.57 Several kilns have been identified in Akhenatens capital city of Amarna as well as traces of both industrial and household pottery production.58 Remains of workshops from about the same time as those at Amarna have been found at Harube in north Sinai. They were located outside the settlement near the granaries and contained areas for preparing the clay and for kilns. They fulfilled the demand of nearby garrisons and official convoys passing through the area.59 Classification and analysisedit Various methods have been developed in archaeology for the classification of Egyptian pottery. The most important is called the Vienna system. This system is based on the following terms60 Fabric this indicates the type of clay and whether it consists of a combination of types of clay and temper or additives. Form this includes changes to the mixture introduced by the potter such as temperadditives and surface treatments. Ware this can encompass a number of different styles with the same claymixture. Fracturefracturing this refers to the assessment of the way in which sherds break. The Vienna systemedit The Vienna System is a classification system for Egyptian pottery which was developed by Dorothea Arnold Manfred Bietak Janine Bourriau Helen and Jean Jacquet and Hanske Nordstrm at a conference in Vienna in 1980. All of them brought sherds from their own excavations which formed the basis for the classification system with a few exceptions. As a result the system is mainly based on find spots of the classic periods and regions of Egypt. According to the group who developed it the system was only intended as a departure point a guide for the description of pottery. The classification of the various wares is based on the measurement of the size of the organic and nonorganic components of the pottery fabric.61 The components are divided into three groups according to their size. Mineral particles like sand and limestone are classified as fine 60250 m medium 250500 m and large larger than 500 m while straw is categorised as fine smaller than 2 mm medium 25 mm and large over 5 mm.62 The meaningfulness of the system is limited somewhat by the caprice of the potter and a degree of accident during manufacture. The system also provides various criteria for the subdivision of Nile clay and marl clay thus the marl clay consists of naturally occurring geological groupings but with Nile clay the different mixtures were created artificially. The system does not take account of surface treatment.63 The system is only of limited use for predynastic pottery and pottery that postdates the New Kingdom. This shows the uncertain state of published research on these periods and the large variation in technique distribution and raw material which occurred in both of these periods.64 Nile clay Aedit Nile clay A Blacktopped pottery Naqada IcIIb The fabric consists of a fine homogeneous clay and a significant proportion of loam. Components are fine sand a conspicuous amount of mediumgrained sand and occasionally large grains of sand. Mica also occurs. Small amounts of tiny straw particles can occur but they are not typical of this form. The quantity of clay and loam and the fine particles suggests that the sand is a natural component not an addition for tempering.65 Nile clay Bedit Nile clay B is subdivided into B1 and B2 B1 The fabric is relatively muddy and not as fine as Nile clay A. There is a lot of fine sand with isolated particles of medium and large grains of sand. Mica particles are common. Isolated fine particles of straw also occur. Surfaces and incisions are often in the original redbrown but blackgray or blackred areas can occur. This type is common from the Old Kingdom until the beginning of the 
18 th dynasty. It is the raw material for the spherical bowls and cups of the Middle Kingdom and especially characteristic of the fine wares of the Delta and the region of MemphisFayyum in that period.66 B2 The fabric is similar to B1 but the mineral and organic components have larger grains and are more frequent. There are large amounts of fine sand and sand grains of medium size are common. Rounded grains of sandstone occur with limestone grains which show some signs of weathering. The demarcation between B and C is not very clear especially between B2 and C. One aid in distinguishing them is that sand is the main additive in type B rather than straw. Unlike B1 B2 is common in all periods and regions. For example Dorothea Arnold identified four varieties of it in LishtSouth. Manfred Bietak identified a largegrained variant from the Second Intermediate Period at Tell ElDaba. Other examples include the late 
12 th and 
13 th dynasties at Dahshur and the late 
18 th dynasty at Karnak.67 Nile clay B Nile clay B Nile clay B Nile clay Cedit This material consists of muddy clay with rough or smooth grains of sand which can vary from fine to large and in frequency from seldom to often. Additives like limestone and other minerals such as mica crushed sherds of pottery and mediumgrained stone particles can occur. Straw is the dominant additive and is often visible in incisions and on the surface. These straw particles range from fine to large with a large amount of large particles over 5 mm. The straw is preserved as charred particles appearing as white or grey silica and as impressions in the paste. Nile clay C occurs in all periods and regions and includes a wide variety of variants.68 Nile clay C1 Nile clay C2 Nile clay Dedit Nile clay D The main sign of Nile clay D is the conspicuous quantity of limestone which might be either a natural component or a tempering additive. Without this visible limestone component this type of clay would be classified differently as Nile clay A at Tell elDaba lightly fired Nile clay B at Dahshur or as Nile clay B2  C at Memphis.69 Nile clay Eedit This clay consists of a large amount of rounded sand particles ranging from fine to large grains which are clearly visible on the surface and in fractures. Aside from these diagnostic components the fabric can look characteristic of Nile clay B or Nile clay C. Nile clay E has so far only been identified in a few locations in the eastern Delta Tell elDaba and Qantir and the region of Memphis and the southern Fayyum.70 Nile clay E1 Nile clay E2 Marl clay Aedit Marl clay A1 This group is divided into four variants. The shared characteristics of Marl clay A are its compact and homogeneous fabric the fine mineral components and very low proportion of organic substances. Marl clay A1 The fabric consists of a relatively fine and homogeneous clay tempered with visible particles of finetomedium grained limestone. This is the most visible aspect in fractures and outer surfaces. The particles are sharp and vary in size from 60 to 400 m with occasional larger particles. Fine sand and dark mica particles are common. Organic additives straw occur occasionally. This clay was common from Naqada II to the Old Kingdom and is one of the fabrics of Meidum ware.71 Marl clay A2 In this variant the mineral additives are very fine and homogeneously distributed through the paste. Fine sand and limestone particles are present but do not dominate. Dark mica particles are present in small quantities. Marl clay A2 occurred from the Middle Kingdom but is most common between the late Second Intermediate period and the 
18 th dynasty mainly in Upper Egypt.71 Marl clay A3 This clay looks the most similar to modern Qena clay although we cannot be sure that it came from this same region. A few mineral additives are visible under magnification in fractures and there is little sign that these were added as temper. The past is extraordinarily fine and homogeneous which could indicate careful preparation of the clay probably with a mortar. Occasionally straw particles occur. This fabric occurs from the early Middle Kingdom into the New Kingdom and seems to stem from Upper Egypt. On the other hand it only rarely occurs in the eastern Delta Tell elDaba and Qantir and the MemphisFayyum region.72 Marl clay A4 Of all the variants of Marl clay A this has the greatest mix and quantity of fine and large sand particles. Mica particles and often straw particles can also occur. This clay already occurred in the Middle Kingdom but is most common in the New Kingdom Amarna Malqata Memphis Saqqara etc..73 Marl clay Bedit The fabric is homogeneous and very thick. The diagnostic feature of the fabric is its high sand content which makes up roughly 40 of the paste and was added as temper. The particles range from angular to vaguely rounded and from fine to large. As in Marl clay A4 limestone additives are visible under magnification appearing as a calcareous material in the clays fabric at 
45 x magnification. Marl clay B was mainly used for large and midsized vessels and seems to be very restricted in space and time to the Second Intermediate period and New Kingdom in Upper Egypt.74 Marl clay Cedit This group is divided into three types. The shared feature of all three is the presence of numerous limestone particles more or less ground down which range from medium to large in size and give the material a sparkly appearance. The fabric itself is fine and thick. Fine and medium sand particles added as temper are also encountered as well as light and dark mica. Marl clay C1 This variant is defined by the presence of fine to medium ground particles of limestone. Fractures are almost always composed of different zones each of which are red with a gray or black core and show many signs of prefatory glazing.75 Marl clay C2 Most of the limestone particles remain intact and fractures do not have zones but a uniform colour which ranges from red Munsell 
10 R 46 to brown Munsell 
5 YR 66. Another distinction from C1 is the sand temper in C2 the proportion of sand is larger than that of limestone.76 Marl clay C compact This clay has much less sand than C1 and C2 and is much thicker. This variant has thus far only been found in a single type of ware  large eggshaped flasks with grooved necks.77 Marl clay Dedit The fabric is fine and homogeneous. The characteristic feature is the limestone particles which were probably added as temper. They are smaller than those in Marl clay C and vary from fine to large in size forming around 25 of the material which is less than the limestone temper of Marl clay C. Fine and largegrained sand black mica and dark stone are also added as temper. Organic additives are very rare. The surface is notably sandy to the touch. This type of clay was very widespread in the Delta and the MemphisFayyum region in the 
18 th and 
19 th Dynasties and seems to appear in the south only as imports from the north.78 Marl clay Eedit The combination is similar to that in Marl clay B with the exception of the visible midtolarge particles of straw which were added as temper. Sand was also added medium to large particles 2040 of the mass of the clay as well as particles of mica. This type of clay is relatively rare but is known in Memphis and Upper Egypt Koptos and Deir elBallas during the short period between the Second Intermediate Period and the early 
18 th dynasty. It was used mainly for thickwalled vessels often handmolded bread tablets. This suggests that the intentional addition of straw might have been connected with this special function.79 Khler codeedit For the predynastic pottery from Buto and Helwan which only has limited overlap with the Vienna system E. Christiana Khler developed a typological code. These fivedigit codes are based on various criteria whereby each digit in the code refers to a particular aspect Appearance largeheavy medium and fine with the numbers 13 Clay type Nile clay  1 Marl clay  2 other clay  3 Surface treatment very rough  1 roughly smoothed  2 wellsmoothed  3 polished  4 Coating no coating  0 black  1 white coating  2 red  3 other colour  4 Presence of additives and tempering normal  1 mainly straw  2 mainly sand  3 significant limestone  4 very little or none  5 fibre  
6.8 0 Petrographic analysesedit Petrographic analysis has also proven useful as a complementary system of classification and analysis to that based on characteristics that are observable to the naked eye or a microscope.81 This technique examines thin slices of the ceramic material or of extracted mineral additives in order to get further information on them.82 It can identify various mineral and organic additives. The structure and porosity of the ceramic material can be precisely measured. The original firing temperature can be determined. The origin of the clay can be identified. It also makes it possible to work out whether other particles in the clay arrived their naturally or were added as temper. Chemical and mineralogical analysisedit Additionally chemical and mineralogical methods developed by archaeological science can be deployed to determine the composition of the clay. Such methods include83 Neutron activation analysis NAA Instrumental Neutron activation analysis INAA Xray fluorescence spectroscopy XRF spectroscopy Atomic emission spectroscopy AES sometimes also called Optical emission spectrometry OES Atomic absorption spectroscopy AAS Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ICPMS XRay diffraction XRD Pottery datingedit William Matthew Flinders Petrie who developed the method of pottery seriation. Pottery seriation has proven useful for constructing an archaeological relative chronology for Egypt. This method was invented in 1899 by Flinders Petrie. In the late twentieth century there was an enormous increase in the studies of Egyptian pottery with respect to the quantity of sherds which have been analysed from a large number of different excavation sites and the range of investigative techniques used to get information out of pottery remains. As a result the changes in the pottery types have become ever more accurately understood over time. For example the shape of breadmolds changed drastically at the end of the Old Kingdom but it is not clear whether this process resulted from social economic or technological causes or just fashion. Thus there are many causes of the changes observed in material culture and only a few can be linked to political changes which dominate traditional perspectives on Egyptian history. On the other hand for example links can be made between political and cultural changes and the changes in pottery from centralised production in the Old Kingdom to the revival of local pottery types during the politically decentralised First Intermediate period to the new unity in the reunified 
12 th Dynasty. Through the study of pottery along with other artifacts it is possible to create a holistic narrative of Egyptian history in which political developments are understood within the context of a long process of cultural change.84 Petries Sequence Datingedit Cylinder vessel with decorative band end of the wayhandled typology Naqada IIIC1 period 
1 st Dynasty King Aha W. M. Flinders Petrie was the first to attempt a pottery seriation which he called a Sequence dating focused on the pottery of the Naqada culture. He published his first study of the relative chronology of the Naqada culture in 18
99.8 5 His first predynastic corpus was based on the excavations of necropoleis at Naqada Deir elBallas86 and Hu.87 Originally he identified nine classes and over 700 pottery types. For this typology he selected 900 intact graves containing five or more types out of the over 4000 graves that he had excavated. He produced an index card for each of them and attempted to place these index cards in order. He made two important observations88 White crosslined potteryNote 1 practically never occurred with DecoratedNote 2 and Wavyhandled pottery.Note 3 The form of the wavyhandled types developed from a bulletshape to a more cylindrical one and from functional handles to decorative lines. After Petrie had arranged all his index cards he divided them into 50 groups each consisting of 18 tombs. He defined SD 30 as the starting point in order to give space for possible earlier cultures which had not then been discovered. He divided the 50 Sequence dates into three groups which he classified as archaeological cultural and chronological and named them after important find spots Amratian SD 3037 Gerzean SD 3860 and Semainean SD 60
75.8 9 Pietre produced a second corpus of protodynastic pottery90 based principally on the finds in the necropolis in Tarchan.91 In this case he identified 885 types but no classes which made it difficult for him to use this seriation. This second corpus partially overlapped with the earlier predynastic corpus. He started with SD 76 and continued to SD 86 with SD 8386 remaining very theoretical due to the shortage of material from the 
2 nd dynasty. This time Petrie based the transition to a new sequence date mainly on typological breaks which Petrie defined on the basis of the development of the Wavyhandled types. He also linked the sequence dates with the historically dated pottery and objects from the royal graves of the early dynasties at Abydos.92 There are some methodological issues with Petries classification93 There is no distinction between typology and chronology. The classes were very heterogeneously defined. The definitions are not based on strict rules. Since only tombs with five or more objects were used the early periods are underrepresented. Regional differences were not considered. The horizontal distribution of pottery within a cemetery was not treated as an important criterion. A systematic problem was that whenever new tombs were discovered new types would need to be defined. Typology of the wavyhandled pottery according to Petrie The evolution of the ceramics from round vessels with two functional handles... ... into cylindrical vessels with decorative bands. Kaisers Stagechronologyedit Typical decorated pottery of period II. The next person to undertake a relative chronology of the predynastic period was Werner Kaiser de arz. He largely accepted Petries typology and used the necropolis 14001500 at Armant as his starting point.94 At the same time Kaiser also paid attention to the horizontal divisions of the pottery record and if a period was not attested at Armant he also used pottery from other cemeteries. He identified three broad zones in the cemetery each of which was dominated by a specific group of pottery Blacktopped Rough wares and Late or WavyHandled wares. Within each of these periods he identified subdivisions which he called stages Stufen. These largely agreed with Petries divisions but not entirely.95 The following were the main stages according to Kaiser Stage I All findspots in Upper Egypt include this stage from the Badari regions to south of Aswan. Cemeteries were dominated by the Blacktopped potteryNote 4 which made up more than 50 of the total assemblage. The second most common types are RedpolishedNote 5 and White CrossLined pottery.96 Stage II According to Werner Kaisers definition this stage was dominated by the Rough pottery.Note 6 However in Stage IIa the Blacktopped pottery increasingly overtakes the Rough pottery. During the transition from Stage IIb to IIc the WavyHandled pottery came into use. Some new Decorated types also appeared at this point.97 Stage III In this stage the Late pottery occursNote 7 outnumbering the Rough pottery. This stage is particularly important for the relative chronology of the predynastic and early dynastic periods since it is contains the final stage of state formation and can partially be connected with the historical chronology of the First and Second dynasties.98 There were still some problems with this chronology99 It was almost entirely based on a single cemetery which made it impossible to detect regional differences. Stages Ia Ib and IIIb are pretty much hypothetical especially the development of the WavyHandled class. Kaiser published only a short summary in the form of an article which only illustrated the characteristic types for each stage. Stan Hendrickxedit Since the mid19
80 s Stan Hendrickx has extended and improved Werner Kaisers model. He based his work on the principle of studying groups of graves as a unit thus also respecting divisions of space within an individual cemetery rather than just studying individual graves and their contents. As a result he faced a conflict between developing a tight relative chronology of all individual pottery types and defining chronologically indicative assemblages. He could not accept a higher priority being given to either of these criteria.100 Computer seriationedit Barry Kemp undertook a multidimensional analysis of the tombs in Necropolis B at elAmrah and the Necropolis at elMahasna. These seriations were only used to evaluate Petries Sequence dating not Kaisers Stagechronology.101 Toby Wilkinson undertook a seriation of eight predynastic and early dynastic necropoleis based on 1420 types from Petries corpus out of a total of 1542 which he arranged into 141 groups. There were large problems with the newly defined groups since they were very heterogeneously defined. For example the cylindrical vessels with and without incised decoration were placed in the same group even though Kaiser had considered the presence of incision to be an important chronological indicator.102 Notesedit  White crosslined pottery mostly consists of Nile clay tempered with sand. The colour of the exterior surface ranges from dark red to reddish brown and is polished. Characteristically it is painted with white or cream coloured images geometric patterns animals plants people and ships.  Decorated pottery is mostly made of marl clay tempered with sand. The surface is wellsmoothed but not polished. The colour ranges from light red to yellowgray. The surface was painted with redbrown images. The most common motifs are ships desert creatures flamingos people spirals wavy lines and Zlines.  The WavyHandled pottery derives from the Naqada IIc period in appearance. In production and working they are identical with the Decorated ware. The outer surface ranges from light red to yellowgray. The characteristic feature is the wavyhandles.  Blacktopped pottery was made of Nile clay tempered with sand and is typical of Naqada I and IIab. Its key characteristics are a black rim and a dark red or reddish brown outer surface which is nearly always polished.  RedPolished pottery is identical to the Blacktopped pottery except that it lacks the black rim.  Rough pottery is made of Nile clay heavily tempered with straw. The outer surfaces are only roughly smoothed with a redbrown colour and no glaze.  Late pottery is made of the same material as the Decorated and WavyHandled wares and includes various kinds of vessel which only came into use in the later Naqada period. Aside from this some of it cannot be distinguished from Rough ware. Referencesedit  Dorothea Arnold excludes figural objects  Keramik Wolfgang Helck Wolfhart Westendorf Lexikon der gyptologie.
