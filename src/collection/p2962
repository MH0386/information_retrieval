29 th Dynasty Hakor or Hagar3 also known by the hellenized forms Achoris or Hakoris was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the 
29 th Dynasty. His reign marks the apex of this feeble and shortlived dynasty having ruled for 13 years  more than half of its entire duration.4 Reignedit Struggle for the accessionedit Hakors accession and relationships with his predecessor Nepherites I were long debated. After Nepherites death a dynastic struggle did seem to have occurred5 and the throne was claimed by two or maybe three pretenders Hakor Psammuthes and possibly a phantom figure called Muthis who was only mentioned in Eusebius epitome of Manethos Aegyptiaca. As a result Hakor was alternately considered Nepherites legitimate successor or an unrelated usurper. In 1986 John D. Ray suggested that Hakor was Nepherites heir who ruled undisturbed until his Year 2 when he was deposed by Psammuthes. After another year Hakor managed to retake his legitimate throne by overthrowing the usurper and continued to date his reign since his first coronation date simply pretending that this gap never occurred. The third pretender Muthis could be inserted within this struggle but his role  assuming that he really did exist  is unknown.6 Rays hypothesis is accepted by other Egyptologists such as Alan B. Lloyd7 and Toby Wilkinson.3 Shortly after his death Hakor was called an usurper by the founder of the subsequent dynasty Nectanebo I. However it has been suggested that Hakor and Nectanebo might have been relatives in some way possibly both related to Nepherites I but rivals to each other.5 Activities in Egyptedit Hakors chapel in Karnak Once reestablished Hakor made considerable exertions to affirm his legitimacy4 putting emphasis on his  real or fictional  descent from Nepherites.58 His building activity was remarkable and he also extensively restored many monuments of his royal predecessors.8 In Karnak Hakor finished the chapel for the sacred barque of AmunRa near the first pylon which was started by Psammuthes or possibly by Nepherites I9 he also possibly began a temple complex in northern Saqqara which was later further developed under Nectanebo II.10 His building activity is well attested in various places in Upper Egypt Luxor Medinet Habu ElKab ElTod Medamud Elephantine in the Temple of Hibis of Kharga Oasis as well as other locations in Middle Egypt.11 Foreign relationsedit Hakor apparently reprised Nepherites foreign policy. In Aristophanes comedy Plutus which was performed in 388 BCE an alliance between the Athenians and the Egyptians is mentioned though it was more likely intended to refer to the Athenian support for the rebellion of Evagoras I of Cyprus  himself allied with Hakor  against the Achaemenids. Theopompus also reported an alliance between Hakor and the Pisidians. The peace of Antalcidas between the Persians and Greeks 387 BCE was a turning point after that Egypt and Cyprus remained the only opponents of Artaxerxes II as reported by Theopompus and Orosius. The following years are quite obscure but it seems that the Persians first attacked Egypt in 385 BCE and after three years of war the Egyptians managed to defeat the invaders121314 The Athenian rhetorician Isocrates mentioned this war vaguely and disparagingly.15 In 381 BCE Hakor sent aid money and 50 triremes apparently without crew though to Evagoras in order to contribute to his resistance against the Great King who after the unsuccessful campaign in Egypt was now focusing on Cyprus. However when in 380 BCE Evagoras travelled to Egypt to beg for further aid Hakor saw no need to continue supporting him and sent him back to Cyprus with merely some more money.1617 Evagoras surrendered to Artaxerxes soon after but Hakor promptly joined a shortlived alliance with Sparta and with Glos son of the Egyptian admiral Tamos who was a supporter of the pretender Cyrus the Younger against Artaxerxes II. Hakor managed to get the Athenian general Chabrias into his service but the Persian general Pharnabazus II lobbied Athens seeking for them to repatriate him.16 Death and successionedit Hakor died in 3798 BCE2 leaving his throne to his son Nepherites II. However the latter was able to keep it for just four months before being overthrown and replaced by an army general from Sebennytos Nectanebo I.3 Referencesedit  Lloyd 1994 p. 358.  a b Depuydt 2006 p. 280.  a b c Wilkinson 2010 p. 456.  a b Lloyd 1994 p. 340.  a b c Grimal 1992 p. 373.
