He ruled Egypt for six to 11 years in the early 
23 rd century BC toward the end of the Old Kingdom period. He was the son of his predecessor Pepi I Meryre and queen Ankhesenpepi I and was in turn succeeded by Pepi II Neferkare who might have been his son or less probably his brother. Pepi I may have shared power with Merenre in a coregency at the very end of the formers reign. Merenres rule saw profound changes in the administration of the southern provinces of Egypt with a marked increase in the number of provincial administrators and a concurrent steep decline in the size of the central administration in the capital Memphis. As a consequence the provincial nobility became responsible for tax collection and resource management gaining in political independence and economic power. This led to the first provincial burials for the highest officials including viziers governors of Upper Egypt and nomarchs. Several trading and quarrying expeditions took place under Merenre in particular to Nubia where caravans numbering hundreds of donkeys were sent to fetch incense ebony animal skins ivory and exotic animals. Such was the interest in the region that Merenre had a canal dug to facilitate the navigation of the first cataract into Nubia. Trade with the Levantine coast for lapis lazuli silver bitumen and tin took place while quarrying for granite travertine and alabaster took place in the south and in the Eastern Desert. A pyramid complex was built for Merenre in Saqqara known as Khanefermerenre by the Ancient Egyptians meaning The appearance of the perfection of Merenre and likely completed prior to the kings death. The subterranean chambers were inscribed with the Pyramid Texts. In the burial chamber the black basalt sarcophagus of the king still held a mummy when it was entered in the 
19 th century. The identification of the mummy as Merenres is still uncertain. Following his death Merenre was the object of a funerary cult until at least the end of the Old Kingdom. During the New Kingdom period he was in a selection of past kings to be honoured. Familyedit Parents and siblingsedit Merenre was the son of king Pepi I Meryre and queen Ankhesenpepi I also called Ankhesenmeryre.56 Pepi I probably begot him in his old age.78 Ankhesenpepis motherhood is indicated by her titles. She bore the title of mother of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt of the pyramid of Merenre in tomb inscriptions9 a style which at the time indicated relation to the king.10 Ankhesenpepi was a daughter of the nomarch of Abydos Khui and his wife Nebet.711 Pepi I made her into a vizier the sole woman of the Old Kingdom period known to have held such a title.1213 Khui and Nebets son Merenres uncle Djau served in the position of vizier under Merenre and Pepi II Neferkare.14 Princess Neith was Merenres full sister.1415 The archaeologist Gustave Jquier has proposed that Neith was first married to Merenre then to Pepi II explaining the absence of her tomb near that of Merenre as would be expected of a royal spouse.16 The Egyptologist Vivienne Callender observes however that among Neiths titles presented in her tomb those referring to her relation to Merenre are now illegible. Consequently Callender states that whether or not she was married to Merenre cannot be ascertained beyond doubt.17 Probable children of Pepi I who might thus be at least halfsiblings of Merenre include princes Hornetjerkhet and Tetiankh and princess Meritites IV.1819 Consorts and childrenedit Sixth dynasty royal seals and stone blocks found at Saqqara demonstrate that Merenres aunt Ankhesenpepi IInote 3 who married Pepi I was also married to Merenre.21 She was the mother of the future pharaoh Pepi II. This is shown by her titles of royal wife of the pyramid of Meryre Royal wife of the pyramid of Merenre and royal mother of the pyramid of Neferkare Pepi II.22 Many Egyptologists favour Pepi I as the father of Pepi II.23 But the Egyptologist Philippe Collombert observes23 that since historical sources agree that Merenres reign intervened between those of Pepi I and Pepi II and lasted for around a decade and given that one source states that Pepi II acceded to the throne at the age of six24 then this indirectly indicates that Merenre I rather than Pepi I was Pepi IIs father.25 This opinion is shared by the Egyptologists Naguib Kanawati and Peter Brand.1321 Merenre had at least one daughter Ankhesenpepi III21 who became the wife of Pepi II.26 Merenre could also be the father of queen Iput II another wife of Pepi II.24 Reignedit Attestationsedit Merenre is well attested by archaeology not only through his pyramid complex but also through inscriptions and small artefacts bearing his name.

07.3 7 Chronologyedit Relativeedit Merenres cartouche on the Abydos King List The relative chronological position of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I within the Sixth Dynasty is certain. Historical sources and archaeological evidences agree that he succeeded Pepi I Meryre on the throne and was in turn succeeded by Pepi II Neferkare evidencing that he was the fourth king of the dynasty.38 The earliest historical source on the matter is the South Saqqara Stone a royal annal inscribed during the reign of either Merenre or Pepi II. An estimated 9239 of the text inscribed on the stone was lost when it was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid possibly in the late First Intermediate c. 21602055 BC to early Middle Kingdom period c. 20551650 BC.40 Nonetheless the few legible text fragments of the annal support the succession Teti  Userkare  Pepi I  Merenre I possibly followed by Pepi II making Merenre the fourth king of the Sixth Dynasty.41 Three more historical sources agree with this chronologynote 4 three of which date to the New Kingdom period. The Abydos King List written under Seti I fl. c.1290 BC places Merenre Is cartouche as the 
37 th entry between those of Pepi I and Pepi II.43 The Turin Canon a list of kings on papyrus dating to the reign of Ramses II fl. c.1250 BC probably records Merenre I in the fifth column fourth rownote 5 and may have supported his relative position within the dynasty although his name as well as those of his predecessor and successor is illegible.44 If the attribution of the entry is correct then Merenre is credited with a reign length ending with the number four45 perhaps some years and four months4647 or four or 14 years.4849 Also dating to the reign of Ramses II is the Saqqara Tablet explicitly relating the succession Pepi I  Merenre I  Pepi II with Merenre located on the 
24 th entry.
44 note 6 The latest historical source recording a similar information is the Aegyptiaca  a history of Egypt written in the third century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II 283246 BC by the priesthistorian Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. According to the Byzantine scholar George Syncellus Africanus wrote that the Aegyptiaca mentioned the succession Othos  Phius  Methusuphis  Phiops at the beginning of the Sixth Dynasty. Othos Phius Methusuphis in Greek  and Phiops are believed to be the Hellenised forms for Teti Pepi I Merenre and Pepi II respectively.50 The Aegyptiaca credits Methusuphis with seven years of reign.50 Absoluteedit Merenres reign is difficult to date precisely in absolute terms. An absolute chronology referring to dates in our modern calendar is estimated by Egyptologists working backwards by adding reign lengthsthemselves uncertain and inferred from historical sources and archaeological evidenceand in a few cases using ancient astronomical observations and radiocarbon dating.51 These methodologies do not agree perfectly and some uncertainty remains. As a result Merenres rule is generally dated to the early 
23 rd century BC.52 Various hypothesesnote 2 have been proposed by scholars though it is impossible to determine which one is right.52 Durationedit The South Saqqara Stone the royal annals of the Sixth Dynasty with register F at the bottom pertaining to Merenres reign69 During the Old Kingdom period Ancient Egyptians dated their documents and inscriptions by counting the years since the accession of the current king to the throne. These years were often referred to by the number of cattle counts which had taken place since the reigns start.70 The cattle count which involved counting cattle oxen and small livestock was an important event aimed at evaluating the amount of taxes to be levied on the population.71 During the early Sixth Dynasty this count was perhaps biennial72 occurring every two years.7073 The latest surviving inscription written during Merenres rule is located in a quarry at Hatnub mentioning the year after the 
5 th cattle count.74 If the cattle count was regular and purely biennial this might correspond to Merenres tenth year on the throne.74 Similarly for Baud and Dobrev a regular biennial count implies that the South Saqqara Stone recorded at least 11 to 13 years of reign for Merenre almost twice the figure of seven years attributed to him in the Aegyptiaca.75 For Baud such a reign length is consistent with the finished state of Merenres pyramid complex.76 In 1959 the Egyptologist and philologist Alan Gardiner proposed reading a now discounted 44 years figure on the Turin canon for Merenre4577 which the Egyptologist and art historian William Stevenson Smith later took to be 14 years instead of which he attributes nine to a coregency between Merenre and Pepi I.78 The Egyptologist Elmar Edel79 thought such lengths of reign would explain the time necessary for the peaceful relations that Egypt entertained with Lower Nubian chiefs under Merenre to switch to more adversarial ones under Pepi II.80 In contrast because of doubts on the regularity of the cattle count4781 and of the general paucity of monuments and documents datable to his reign Merenre is often credited with less than a decade on the throne by most modern Egyptologists somenote 7 give him nine to eleven years while othersnote 8 propose six or seven years of reign.44 Accession to the throne coregencyedit Merenres father Pepis rule seem to have been troubled at times with at least one conspiracy against him hatched by one of his harem consorts.87 This may have given him the impetus to ally himself with Khui the nomarch of Coptos by marrying his daughters queens Ankhesenpepi I and II.121388 The Egyptologist Naguib Kanawati conjectures that Pepi faced another conspiracy toward the end of his reign in which his vizier Rawer may have been involved. To support his theory Kanawati observes that Rawers image in his tomb has been desecrated with his name hands and feet chiselled off while this same tomb is dated to the second half of Pepis reign on stylistic grounds.89 Kanawati further posits that the conspiracy may have aimed at having someone else made heir to the throne at the expense of the designated heir Merenre. Because of this failed conspiracy Pepi I may have taken the drasticnote 9 step of crowning Merenre during his own reign93 possibly in an attempt to secure stability and continuity within the family as Miroslav Brta writes93 thereby creating the earliest documented coregency in the history of Egypt.89 The Egyptologists Jaromir Mlek and Miroslav Verner agree with this analysis54 Verner adds that Merenre acceded to the throne at an early age and died young.5494 That such a coregency took place was first proposed by tienne Drioton who pointed to a gold pendant bearing the names of both Pepi I and Merenre I as living kings implying that both ruled concurrently for some time.9596 In support of this hypothesis the Egyptologist Hans Goedicke mentions the inscription dated to Merenres year of the fifth cattle count from Hatnub which he takes to indicate ten years of rule hence contradicting Manethos figure of seven years. This could be evidence that Merenre dated the start of his reign before the end of his fathers reign as a coregency would permit.97 The smaller copper statue from Hierakonpolis representing Merenre or a young Pepi I98 A possible further piece of evidence for a coregency is given by two copper statues uncovered in an underground store beneath the floor of a Kachapel of Pepi in Hierakonpolis.99 There the Egyptologist James Quibell uncovered a statue of King Khasekhemwy of the Second Dynasty a terracotta lion cub made during the Thinite era100 a golden mask representing Horus and two copper statues.101 Originally fashioned by hammering plates of copper over a wooden base101102 these statues had been disassembled placed inside one another and then sealed with a thin layer of engraved copper bearing the titles and names of Pepi I on the first day of the Sed festival.100 The two statues were symbolically trampling underfoot the Nine bowsthe enemies of Egypta stylized representation of Egypts conquered foreign subjects.103 While the identity of the larger adult figure as Pepi I is revealed by the inscription the identity of the smaller statue showing a younger person remains unresolved.100 The most common hypothesis among Egyptologists is that the young man shown is Merenre.104 As Alessandro Bongioanni and Maria Croce write Merenre was publicly associated as his fathers successor on the occasion of the Jubilee the Sed festival. The placement of his copper effigy inside that of his father would therefore reflect the continuity of the royal succession and the passage of the royal sceptre from father to son before the death of the pharaoh could cause a dynastic split.105 Alternatively Bongioanni and Croce have also proposed the smaller statue may represent a more youthful Pepi I reinvigorated by the celebration of the Jubilee ceremonies.106 The smaller copper statue from Hierakonpolis representing Merenre or a young Pepi I98 The existence of the coregency remains uncertain lacking any definite proof.107 For Vassil Dobrev and Michel Baud who analysed the royal annals of the South Saqqara Stone Merenre directly succeeded his father in power. In particular the legible parts of the annals bear with no traces in direct support of an interregnum or coregency. More precisely the document preserves the record of Pepi Is final year and proceeds immediately to the first year of Merenre.108 Furthermore the shape and size of the stone on which the annals are inscribed makes it more probable that Merenre did not start to count his years of reign until soon after the death of his father.109 Furthermore William J. Murnane writes that the gold pendants context is unknown making its significance regarding the coregency difficult to appraise. The copper statues are similarly inconclusive as the identity of the smaller one and whether they originally formed a group remains uncertain.110 Domestic activitiesedit Administrationedit Provincial tomb of Heqaib near Aswan Developments of the provincial administration were undertaken during Merenres rule111 with a marked increase in the number of provincial administrators including newly created titles for granary and treasury overseers paralleled with a steep decline in the size of the central administration in Memphis.112113 For the Egyptologists Nigel Strudwick and Petra Andrassy this witnesses to an incessantly112 evolving domestic policy aimed at managing the remote southern provinces.114115 The motivations behind such changes are not clear. Either an attempt was made at improving the provincial administration or the goal was to disperse powerful nobles throughout the realm away from the royal court.112 Indeed the many marriages of Pepi I may have generated instability by creating competing groups and factions at court.116 In any case the reforms appear to have been implemented rather uniformly suggesting that the central executive authority of the state was still substantial at that time.115 With these changes provincial officials were now directly responsible for the collection of local tax and labour and dealt with all works in their nomes from then on.117114 The increasing political and economic importance of individual nomes and local centres is reflected in that even the highest ranking officials including the viziers and the overseers of Upper Egypt started to be abundantly buried in the provinces rather than close to the royal necropolis.93118119 For example the nomarch of the second nome Qar was buried in Edfu120 nomarchs Harkhuf and later Heqaib in Qubbet elHawa near Aswan121 vizier Idi near modernday Asyut and vizier Weni in the eighth nome at Abydos.122 More provincial burials of Upper Egyptian nomarchs from this time period have been uncovered in Elephantine Thebes fourth nome Coptos fifth nome Dendera sixth nome Qasr elSayed seventh nome Akhmim ninth nome Deir elGabrawi 
12 th nome Meir 
14 th nome El Sheikh Said 
15 th nome Zawyet elMaiyitin 
16 th nome Kom elAhmar 
18 th nome Deshasha 
20 th nome119 and Balat in the Dakhla Oasis.93 These rockcut tombs are markedly different from the mastabas of the royal necropolises.93 At the same time Pepi I Merenre and Pepi II deliberately set up cults for queens Ankhesenpepi I Ankhesenpepi II and later Iput II in the Qift province whence they originated. Richard Bumann says this was an effort to strengthen the kings ties to powerful families in Upper Egypt.123 At the personal level Merenre may have appointed Idi124 possibly a relative of Djau to the courtly rank of sole companion of the king and nomarch of the Upper Egyptian eighth nome.125 Idi later served Pepi II in the 
12 th nome.126 Another administrative official whom Merenre promoted was Weni. He was made leader of quarrying expeditions then a count and governor of Upper Egypt.127128 In this role Weni organised two censuses and two corves in the South on behalf of the court.129 Weni was then elevated to the highest offices those of vizier and chief judge130 and likely died during Merenres reign.131 Merenre appointed Qar nomarch of Edfu and overseer of Upper Egyptian grain and livestock resources.132 He was also appointed chief judge over the whole of Upper Egypt.133 Merenre also made Kaihap Tjeti a provincialborn young royal courtier under Pepi I134 into a stolist of the god Min. Kaihap Tjeti later became nomarch of the ninth Upper Egyptian nome under Merenre or Pepi II and was buried near Akhmim.135 Cultic activitiesedit Fragments of private stele bearing Merenres cartouche from Kom elSultan136 Religious activities dating to Merenres reign are recorded on the legible passages of the South Saqqara Stone early in his reign he offered 30 oxen to an unidentified god and five to Wadjet.137 To Seth he offered a lost number of oxen.138 A statue of the king might also have been erected in the first couple of years of his reign.139140 Additional offerings can be inferred from the surviving remnants of the texts numbering hundreds or even thousands141 of oxen lapislazuli141 loincloths incense to Ptah142 Heryshaf Nefertum and the Ennead143 hundreds of birds and perfumed oil to KhentiAmentiu144 and silver objects and kohl to Khentikheti. The list of offerings also mentions Djedkare Isesi143145 penultimate king of the Fifth Dynasty who seems to have been held in high esteem during Merenres reign.143 Merenre even chose to place his pyramid complex close to that of Djedkare.146 In addition to these activities Merenre made a decree pertaining to the funerary cult of Menkaure as shown by fragmentary inscriptions uncovered in the latters mortuary temple.147148 Construction worksedit The main monument dating to Merenres reign is his pyramid complex. Apart from this there are tentative indications that Merenre had work carried out in the temple of Osiris and KhentiAmentiu in modernday Kom elSultan near Abydos. There fragments of several private stelae dating to his reign were uncovered in the temples foundations which was completely renovated in the 
12 th dynasty c.19901800 BC. The nature and extent of the works undertaken at the time cannot be fully ascertained136 possibly Merenre had a Kachapel built there following his father who built such chapels extensively throughout Egypt.1
49 note 10 End of reignedit A second coregency between Merenre and Pepi II has been proposed by Stevenson Smith following the discovery of a cylinder seal in Tell elMaskhuta.78 The seal belonging to an administrative official is inscribed with the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Merenre living forever like Re and shows the king smiting an enemy and the Horus names of both Merenre and Pepi II in serekhs facing one another.81 This evidence for a shared reign is circumstantial and could equally well indicate that the official meant to convey that he served in the army under both kings151 or that the kings were close kin.152 Given Pepi IIs youth on acceding to the throne and Merenres likely short reign William J. Murnane and others after him including Anthony Spalinger80 and Nigel Strudwick152 have rejected the idea of a coregency between the two rulers.151 In contrast for Miroslav Brta the possibility of this coregency cannot be excluded.93 Foreign activitiesedit Inscription of Merenre from Hatnub153 Eastern Desert and Levantedit Merenre sent at least one mining expedition to Wadi Hammamat in the Eastern Desert to collect greywacke and siltstone.154 Weni who began his career under Teti rose through the ranks of the administration under Pepi I was the leader of this expedition and reported its goal His majesty sent me to Ibhatnote 11 especially to bring back the sarcophagus Chest of the living and its lid as well as a costly and noble pyramidion for the pyramid of Merenre my mistress.155 The expedition left two inscriptions in the Wadi156157 indicating that it took place on the year of the second cattle count probably Merenres fourth year on the throne.158 Alabaster was extracted from Hatnub87 also in the Eastern Desert a location where an expedition under the leadership of Weni was tasked with the quarrying of a very large travertine altar stone for the pyramid of Merenre74129159160161 Horus Ankhkhau the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Merenre. The Behdetite. The perfect god lord of the Two Lands. May all protection and life be behind him like Re for ever. Year after the fifth occasion. A mission which the Hatya overseer of Upper Egypt sole companion Weni carried out.162 While there is no direct evidence for Egyptian activity in Sinai specifically during Merenres reign frequent expeditions were sent in the region for turquoise and other resources during the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties. Egypt in all probability maintained diplomatic and trade relations with Byblos to procure cedar wood163 and with Canaan and the wider Levantthen in the Early Bronze Age IV to Middle Bronze Age I period1
64 as witnessed by imported jars found in the tombs of Idi and Weni.165 Further abroad the high official Iny who served under Pepi I Merenre and Pepi II either led or participated in a seaborne mission to SyriaPalestine possibly during Merenres rule to obtain lapis lazuli silver bitumen166 and lead or tin.167 In addition a possible military campaign in the southern Levant which Weni may have conducted under Pepi I shows the continuing interest in those regions to the east and northeast of the Nile Delta on behalf of the Egyptian state at the time.168169 Nubiaedit Drawing of a relief from Aswan showing Merenre receiving the submission of Lower Nubian chieftains possibly dated to his first regnal year80 During Merenres reign Lower Nubia was the focus of Egypts foreign policy interests. Two rock reliefs depict the king receiving the submission of Nubian chieftains the earlier of which located on the ancient route from Aswan to Philae near the First Cataract shows Merenre standing on the symbol for the union of the two lands suggesting that it was carved during his first year of reign.80170 Toward the end of the Old Kingdom period Nubia saw the arrival of the CGroup people from the south. Centred at Kerma they struggled intermittently with Egypt and its allies over control of the region which for the Egyptians was a source of incense ebony animal skins ivory and exotic animals.163 Three Egyptian hosts were sent in expeditions by Merenre to procure luxury goods from Lower Nubia171 where tribes had united to form a state172 into the land of Yam fr possibly modernday Dongola or Shendi.173 These expeditions took place under the direction of the caravan conductor and later nomarch of Elephantine Harkhuf.5 He claimed to have pacified the land South of Egypt but his expeditions likely constituted a labour force and a traders caravan above all. The aim of such expeditions was first and foremost to exploit resources the locals would not or could not use and only rarely did they had to fight.171 The first expedition during which Harkhuf was accompanied by his father the lector priest Iri174 lasted for seven months while the second took eight months.5 On the third expedition which took place at the end of Merenres reign or early in Pepi IIs47 Harkhuf was informed that the king of Yam had gone to war against the Tjemehu people possibly Libyans or people to the west of Nubia.175 He consequently either joined his forces with those of Yam in order to defeat their adversaries and gain riches5 or he caught up with the king of Yam to prevent the outbreak of hostilities.175 The ruler of Irtjet Setju and Wawat might have further threatened to interfere with Harkhufs return to Egypt but changed stance offering cattle and goats to Harkhuf. This was possibly after he had received gifts or because of Harkhufs strong escort.176177 At any rate Harkhuf went to great length to explain to the king his unexpected delays as the duration of these expeditions was a matter of pride to him.175 He was greeted in return by an envoy from the court bringing datewine cakes bread and beer.177 Such expeditions each of which represented a 20003000 kilometres 12001900 mi roundtrip journey178 took the form of large caravans of donkeys. The third one led by Harkhuf numbered three hundred asses carrying various goods including incense ebony and grain in large storage jars.179 To meet the demands of trade within Egypt and outside of Egypt for pack animals donkeys were raised in large numbers in Egypt since at least the Fourth Dynasty.180 Relief from ElHesseh depicting Merenre and mentioning the submission of Lower Nubia from his fifth year of reign181 In the year of the fifth cattle count since the beginning of his reign Merenre travelled south to Elephantine from his capital to receive the submission of Nubian chieftains.172 This is indicated by an inscription and relief located opposite the cataract island of ElHesseh near Philae183184 The king of Upper and Lower Egypt Merenre beloved of Khnum lord of the cataract region. Year of the fifth occasion second month of the Shemu season day 28. A visit from the king himself when he stood at the far end of the foreign lands the rulers of Medja Irertjt and Wawat kissed the ground and gave great praise.182 On the same occasion Merenre might also have visited the temple of Satet on Elephantine island to renew a naos erected by Pepi I.172 This is suggested by another inscription of Merenre on the rock face of a natural grotto in a niche of the temple185 Year of the fifth occasion second month of the Shemu season day 24. A visit from the king himself when he made prisoners of the rulers of the foreign lands the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Merenre may he live for ever.186 Besides Harkhuf another Egyptian high official who was active in Nubia at the time was Weni who had been promoted to commander of the army by Pepi I. As such Weni hired Nubian mercenaries for his military campaigns in Sinai and the Levant mercenaries which were also frequently employed as police force.163 Weni was also tasked with bringing back from Elephantine to Memphis a false door of granite and granite doorway and lintels for the upper chamber of the pyramid complex of Merenre.187 He did so sailing downstream with six cargoboats three tow boats and one warship188 finally mooring by the pyramid.187 The towboats were large barges capable of transporting heavy loads Wenis biography gives their dimensions as 31 m 102 ft in length and 
15.5  m 51 ftwide.189 Overall Egyptian activities in Lower Nubia were sufficiently important that Weni was directed to oversee the excavation of a fivechannels canal near modernday Shellal.129190 The canal ran parallel to the Nile in order to facilitate the navigation of the First Cataract.57163 On the same occasion Weni had seven boats of acacia built from timber he had received from Nubian chieftains.191 Pyramid complexedit Main article Pyramid of Merenre Main pyramidedit The ruined pyramid of Merenre The pyramid of Merenre was built at South Saqqara. The Ancient Egyptians named it Khanefermerenre which is variously translated as Merenre appears in glory and is beautiful192 The perfection of Merenre rises5 The appearance of the perfection of Merenre60 and Merenre appears and is beautiful.193 The pyramid is located 450 m 1480 ft to the southwest of the pyramid of Pepi I and a similar distance to the pyramid of Djedkare.83 The pyramid originally reached a height of 100 Egyptian cubits c. 
52.5  m 172 ft and had a square base sidelength of 150 cubits c. 79 m 259 ft.83 This would give the elevation of Merenres pyramid a hypotenuse of 125 cubits and consequently an elevation slope in the same proportion as Khafres pyramid at Giza. The triangle formed by half of the base the height and the hypotenuse 75 100 125 cubitsform a Pythagorean Triple reduceable to proportions of 345. It may have been accessed via a causeway starting from a harbour located on the nearby Wadi Tafla some 300 m 980 ft away but also 27 m 89 ft below.83 Fine limestone for the pyramid was quarried in Tura the quarries being administered from Saqqara or Memphis.194 The inner passages of the pyramid were laid out according to those found in Djedkare Isesis pyramid.195 They are inscribed with the Pyramid Texts.196 Discovered by the Egyptologist Gaston Maspero at the end of the nineteenth century197 the texts of the pyramid of Merenre were only published in full in 2019 by the Egyptologist Isabelle PierreCroisiau.198 The north wall of the burial chamber now completely ruined bore offering ritual formulae which continued onto the east wall as is the case in the pyramids of Unas Teti and Pepi I.199 The Pyramid Texts are made of hundreds of utterances organised in groups of inscriptions yet in different copies the utterances could be in varying position within a group and exchanged between groups. This reveals some editorial dynamism in the composition of the rites they represent.200 The south and west wall of the burial chamber of Merenre bear texts concerning the transfiguration of the king.201 On the east wall are utterances calling for the perpetuation of the cult of the deceased ruler while two further groups of texts on the resurrection of Horus and the protection of Nut are found on the opposite wall.202 The rest of the texts found in the burial chamber pertain to the anointing and wrapping of the king203 his provisioning204 summons by Isis and Nephthys205 and the ascent to the sky.206 Leading out of the sarcophagus chamber the walls of the antechamber bear texts calling for the kings joining the company of the gods and apotropaic formulae.207 The remaining corridors and vestibules of the tomb bear utterances on the celestial circuit of the king and gods.208 Mortuary templeedit The pyramid of Merenre is surrounded by a wider mortuary complex its offering chapel located on the north face of the pyramid. Fragments of reliefs showing the gods greeting the king in the afterlife have been uncovered there. The hall of the chapel is paved with limestone. Further on stands the base of a granite falsedoor. Some of the decoration of the complex was left unfinished as work likely stopped at the death of the king.209 Mummyedit Mummified head found in the burial chamber of the pyramid of Merenre In 1881 the Egyptologists mile and Heinrich Karl Brugsch managed to enter the burial chamber of Merenres pyramid via a robbers tunnel. They found its massive ceiling beams of limestone hanging dangerously as the lower retaining walls of the chamber had been removed by stone robbers.83 The black basalt sarcophagus was still intact its lid pushed back and in it lay the mummy of a 
1.6 6 m 
5.4  fttall man.83 The mummy was in a poor condition because ancient tomb robbers had partially torn off its wrappings. The Brugsch brothers decided to transport the mummy to Cairo in order to show it to Auguste Mariette head of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities and by then dying. During the transport the mummy suffered further damage problems with the railroads prevented the mummy from being taken to Cairo by train and the Brugschs took the decision to carry it on foot. After the wooden sarcophagus employed to that end had become too heavy they took out the mummy and broke it into two pieces. Parts of the mummy including the head remained in the Boulaq Cairo neighbourhood until they were moved to the nearby Egyptian Museum. mile Brugsch donated some of the rest a collarbone cervical vertebrae and a rib to the Egyptian Museum of Berlin. These have not been located since World War II.210211212 Preliminary forensic analyses of the mummy by Grafton Elliot Smith indicate that it is that of a young man as suggested by possible traces of a sidelock of youth.78213 The identity of the mummy remains uncertain as Elliot Smith observed that the technique employed for the wrapping was typical of the Eighteenth Dynasty fl.c.15501292 BC rather than the Sixth.15 Rewrapping of older mummies is known to have occurred so that this observation does not necessarily preclude that the mummy is that of Merenre.15 The mummy has not been properly studied since Elliott Smiths analyses in the early 
20 th century and its identification remains uncertain.83 Legacyedit Old Kingdomedit Like other kings of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties Merenre was the object of an official statesponsored funerary cult which took place in his pyramid complex. In the midSixth Dynasty nomarchs were overseer of the priests of such cults. For instance Qar nomarch of Edfu214 and Gegi nomarch of the Thinite nome were instructor of the priests of the pyramid Merenre appears and is beautiful193 Heqaib nomarch of the first nome of Upper Egypt under Pepi II was leader of the phylenote 12 of the pyramid of Merenre.216 Some of the priests serving the cult in the pyramid complex of Merenre are known by name including Iarti and his son Merenreseneb217 a certain Meru called Bebi218 and Nipepy who also officiated in the pyramid of Pepi I.219 Another piece of evidence concerning this cult comes from a decree of Pepi II exempting people living in the pyramid town of Merenre from tax or corve.220 A fragmentary papyrus letter from a certain Ankhpepynote 13 inspector of the royal granary at the pyramid town of Merenre further confirms its existence and prosperity at the time of Merenres and Pepi IIs reigns ...of the pyramid of Merenre which is made in excellent fashion ... of stone in accordance with my orders I have spent a year at the pyramid of Merenre which is indeed prospering...221 A few priests serving the funerary cult of Merenre during the later Sixth Dynasty are known for example the priest Idu Seneni served in both Merenres and Pepi IIs pyramids.133 The cult was active even outside of Merenres mortuary temple at Saqqara inscriptions in Elkab attest to the presence of priests of this cult officiating in or in the vicinity of the local temple of Nekhbet.222 This perhaps persisted into the First Intermediate Period as possibly witnessed by the career of Menankhpepy.note 14 Menankhpepy served as priest in the pyramid complex of Merenre but uncertainties on the precise dating of his lifetime hinder positive conclusions on the persistence of Merenres cult in the turmoil of the First Intermediate Period. The Egyptologists Henry George Fischer and Ludwig Borchardt proposed that Menankhpepy lived during the Ninth224 or Eleventh225 Dynasties respectively while recent reappraisals have led to a Sixth Dynasty dating.2262272
28 note 15 Later periodsedit The deposit of cultic objects comprising the two bronze statues of Pepi I and possibly Merenre uncovered by James Quibell in Hierakonpolis was in all probability placed there during building works in the early Middle Kingdom period.230 This deposit and others like it found in the temple area is composed of ceremonial objects and statuary dating from the earlier periods. This suggests some cultic practices with them up to that point.231 Similarly some cult of Merenre existed or was revived in the New Kingdom period as shown by the presence of his cartouche on the Karnak King List. The list was composed during the reign of Thutmosis III c. 14791425 BC with the purpose of honouring a selection of royal ancestors.42 Merenre is the name of the pharaoh and one of the main protagonists in the Frenchlanguage animated cartoon series Papyrus fr. The cartoon depicts him as a benevolent ruler father of the main heroine princess ThtiChri.232233 In the comics Papyrus the pharaoh is named after Merneptah instead.234 Notesedit  The box inventory N. 794 is inscribed with on the lid Horus Ankhkhau the king of Upper and Lower Egypt the Two Ladies Ankhkhau the double Golden Horus Merenre may he live for ever and on the front of the box Horus Ankhkhau. The king of Upper and Lower Egypt Merenre. The Two Ladies Ankhkhau. Given life for ever.1 The box might originate from Thebes and might have originally been part of the funerary equipment of a provincial official.2  a b List of dates proposed for Merenres reign 23612355 BC53 23102300 BC554 22872278 BC855565758 22852279 BC5960 22832278 BC4 22832269 BC61 22632257 BC62 22602254 BC63 22552246 BC326465 22522242 BC66 22352229 BC59 22272217 BC6667 22192212 BC.68  Ankhesenpepi II was either the full sister of the half sister of Ankhesenpepi I.20  In addition to these sources Merenres cartouche is also present on the Karnak King List composed during the reign of Thutmosis III c. 14791425 BC. The list was meant to present a selection of past kings that were to receive a cult. In particular the kings are given out of chronological order and therefore Merenres relative position within the Sixth Dynasty cannot be ascertained from this source.42  This corresponds to the fourth column fourth row in Gardiners reading of the canon.44  Also reported as
