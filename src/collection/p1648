22 nd Dynasty Usermaatre Osorkon IV was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh during the late Third Intermediate Period. Traditionally considered the last king of the 
22 nd Dynasty he was de facto little more than ruler in Tanis and Bubastis in Lower Egypt. He is generally  though not universally  identified with the King Shilkanni Akkadian  mentioned by Assyrian sources and with the biblical So King of Egypt Hebrew  S mentioned in the second Books of Kings 174. Osorkon ruled during one of the most chaotic and politically fragmented periods of ancient Egypt in which the Nile Delta was dotted with small Libyan kingdoms and principalities and Meshwesh dominions as the last heir of the Tanite rulers he inherited the easternmost parts of these kingdoms the most involved in all the political and military upheavals that soon would afflict the Near East. During his reign he had to face the power of and ultimately submit himself to the Kushite King Piye during Piyes conquest of Egypt. Osorkon IV also had to deal with the threatening NeoAssyrian Empire outside his eastern borders. Reignedit Early yearsedit Osorkon IV ascended to the throne of Tanis in c. 730 BC4 at the end of the long reign of his predecessor Shoshenq V of the 
22 nd Dynasty5678 who was possibly also his father.9 However this somewhat traditional collocation was first challenged in 1970 by KarlHeinz Priese who preferred to place Osorkon IV in a lowerEgyptian branch of the 
23 rd Dynasty right after the reign of the shadowy pharaoh Pedubast II10 this placement found the support of a certain number of scholars.11121314 Osorkons mother named on an electrum aegis of Sekhmet now in the Louvre was Tadibast III.15 Osorkon IVs realm was restricted only to the district of Tanis Rnfr and the territory of Bubastis both in the eastern Nile Delta.16 His neighbors were Libyan princes and Meshwesh chiefs who ruled their small realms outside of his authority.17 Closeup of the Victory Stela of Piye. Osorkon IV is the left one among the prostrating kings. Around 72928 BC soon after his accession Osorkon IV faced the crusade led by the Kushite pharaoh Piye of the Nubian 
25 th Dynasty. Along with other rulers of Lower and Middle Egypt  mainly Nimlot of Hermopolis and Iuput II of Leontopolis  Osorkon IV joined the coalition led by the Chief of the West Tefnakht in order to oppose the Nubian.18 However Piyes advance was unstoppable and the opposing rulers surrendered one after another Osorkon IV found it wise to reach the Temple of Ra at Heliopolis and pay homage to his new overlord Piye personally19 an action which was soon imitated by the other rulers. As reported on his Victory Stela Piye accepted their submission but Osorkon and most of the rulers were not allowed to enter the royal enclosure because they were not circumcised and had eaten fish both abominations in the eyes of the Nubian.2021 Nevertheless Osorkon IV and the others were allowed to keep their former domains and authority.2223 The Assyrian threatedit In 72625 BC Hoshea the last King of Israel rebelled against the Assyrian King Shalmaneser V who demanded an annual tribute and according to the second Book of Kings sought the support of So King of Egypt 2 Kings 174 who as already mentioned was most likely Osorkon IV see below. For reasons which remained unknown  possibly in order to remain neutral towards the powerful NeoAssyrian Empire or simply because he did not have enough power or resources  King So did not help Hoshea who was subsequently defeated and deposed by Shalmaneser V. The Kingdom of Israel ceased to exist many Israelites were brought to Assyria as exiles24 and Assyrian and Babylonian settlers occupied Israel.252627 Sargon II Osorkons Assyrian opponent. In 720 BC a revolt occurred in Palestine against the new Assyrian King Sargon II led by King Hanunu of Gaza who sought the help of Piru of Musri a term most probably meaning Pharaoh of Egypt and referring to Osorkon IV. Assyrian sources claim that this time the Egyptian king did send a turtanu an armycommander called Ree or Reu his Egyptian name was Raia though in the past it was read Sibe as well as troops in order to support his neighboring ally. However the coalition was defeated in battle at Raphia. Ree fled back to Egypt Raphia and Gaza were looted and Hanunu was burnt alive by the Assyrians.2829 In 716 BC Sargon II almost reached Egypts boundaries. Feeling directly threatened this time Osorkon IV here called Shilkanni by Assyrian sources see below was carefully diplomatic he personally met the Assyrian king at the Brook of Egypt most likely elArish and tributed him with a present which Sargon personally described as twelve large horses of Egypt without equals in Assyria. The Assyrian king appreciated his gifts and did not take action against Osorkon IV.30 Endedit No mention of Osorkon IV is known after 716 BC. Some archaeological findings31 suggest that shortly after this date Bocchoris Bakenrenef of the 
24 th Dynasty may have expanded his realm eastward supplanting Osorkon at Tanis. In 712 BC Piyes successor Shebitku marched northward and defeated Bocchoris.32 When around the same year King Iamani of Ashdod sought refuge from Sargon II in Egypt Shebitku was in fact the sole ruler of Egypt and returned Iamani to the Assyrians in chains.3334 In any case Osorkon IV was seemingly dead before that year.35 A few years later a man called Gemenefkhonsbak possibly a descendant of the nowdefunct 
22 nd Dynasty claimed for himself the pharaonic royal titles and ruled in Tanis as its prince.36 Identification with Shilkanni and Soedit It is believed that Shilkanni is a rendering of Ushilkan which in turn is derived from Osorkon  hence Osorkon IV  as first proposed by William F. Albright in 19
56.3 738 This identification is accepted by several scholars39404142434445 while others remain uncertain46 or even skeptical.47 Shilkanni is reported by Assyrians as King of Musri this location once believed to be a country in northern Arabia by the Orientalist Hans Alexander Winckler is certainly to be identified with Egypt instead.48 In the same way the Piru of Musri to whom Hanno of Gaza asked for help in 720 BC could only have been Osorkon IV.49 The identity of the biblical King So is somewhat less definite. Generally an abbreviation of Osorkon is again considered the most likely by several scholars5051525354555657 but the concurrent hypothesis which equates So with the city of Sais hence with King Tefnakht is supported by a certain number of scholars.58596061 Attestationsedit Small aegis of Sekhmet with the name of Osorkon and Tadibast in the Louvre. Osorkon IV is attested by Assyrian documents as Shilkanni and other epithets and probably also by the Books of Kings as King So while Manethos epitomes seem to have ignored him.62 He is undoubtedly attested by the wellknown Victory Stela of Piye63 on which he is depicted while prostrating in front of the owner of the stela along with other submitted rulers. Another finding almost certainly referring to him is the aforementioned aegis of Sekhmet found at Bubastis and mentioning a King Osorkon son of queen Tadibast whoas the name does not coincide with those of any of the other Osorkon kings motherscan only be Osorkon IVs mother.64 About the throne nameedit Osorkons throne name was thought to be Aakheperre Setepenamun from a few monuments naming a namesake pharaoh Osorkon such as a faience seal and a reliefblock both in the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden65 but this attribution was questioned by Frederic Payraudeau in 2000. According to him these findings could rather be assigned to an earlier Aakheperre Osorkon  i.e. the distant predecessor Osorkon the Elder of the 
21 st Dynasty  thus implying that Osorkon IVs real throne name was unknown.66 Furthermore in 201011 a French expedition discovered in the Temple of Mut at Tanis two blocks bearing a relief of a King Usermaatre Osorkonu depicted in a quite archaizing style which at first were attributed to Osorkon III.67 In 2014 on the basis of the style of both the relief and the royal name Aidan Dodson rejected the identification of this king with both the alreadyknown kings Usermaatre Osorkon Osorkon II and III and stated that he was rather Osorkon IV with his true throne name.68 A longknown archaizing glassy faience statuette fragment from Memphis now exhibited at the Petrie Museum UC13128 which is inscribed for one King Usermaatre had been tentatively attributed to several pharaohs from Piye to Rudamun of the Theban 
23 rd Dynasty and even to Amyrtaios of the 
28 th Dynasty but may in fact represent Osorkon IV.69 See alsoedit Pharaohs in the Bible for other historical or conjectural pharaohs cited in the Bible Referencesedit  Dodson 2014 pp. 78  Dodson 2014 pp. 910  Dodson 2014 pp. 910  Kitchen 1996 p. 92  Berlandini 1979 pp. 100101  Edwards 1982 p. 569  Schneider 1985 pp. 261263  Mitchell 1991 p. 340  Grimal 1992 pp. 330331  Priese 1970 p. 20 n. 23  Leahy 1990 p. 89  von Beckerath 1997 p. 99  see also JansenWinkeln 2006 pp. 24647 and references therein.
