13 th Dynasty during the late Middle Kingdom. He apparently had a short reign and is mainly attested in the MemphisFaiyum region in Egypt. Attestationsedit Imyremeshaw is mainly attested in the MemphisFaiyum region. Pair of Colossi Cairo JE 37466 and JE 374

3 wy.3 This is a Memphite epithet indicating that the statues must originally have been set up in the temple of Ptah in Memphis.1 During the 
15 th Dynasty the colossi were moved to Avaris by the Hyksos ruler Aqenenre Apepi during the Second Intermediate Period. Apepi added his name and a dedication to Seth Lord of Avaris on the right shoulder of each statue. In the 
19 th Dynasty during the New Kingdom both colossi were moved to PiRamesses by Ramses II who also had his name inscribed on them together with a further dedication to Seth. Syenite statue of Imyremeshaw photographed by Flinders Petrie during his excavations at Tanis Finally during the 
21 st Dynasty the statues were moved to Tanis. Here the colossi remained until the 1897 excavations under the direction of Flinders Petrie.145 Bead BM EA 741
85 edit Of Unknown Provenance a white steatite bead bearing the inscription The good god Smenkhkare beloved of Sobek Lord of Shedyt.6 Egyptologists Darrell Baker and Kim Ryholt propose that the reference to Shedyt Faiyum a town close to the Memphis region on the bead could indicate that the bead originates from this location. Statuette Cairo JE 54493 weakedit At Saqqara South the torso of a statuette was found in an unfinished pyramid dated to the 
13 th Dynasty.7 W. Davis 1981 proposed that the statuette belonged to a close successor of Khendjer which could be Imyremeshaw. The fragment however is uninscribed and Davies identification of the owner of the statuette as Imyremeshaw is based solely on grounds of provenance.48 NonContemporary Attestationsedit The Turin King List column 721 reads The Dual King ...kara Imyremeshaw x years x months and 4 days.910 In the list Imyremeshaw is preceded by Userkare Khendjer 719 and succeeded by Sehotepkare Intef 722. Theoriesedit Nameedit The nomen of Imyremeshaw is a well attested name in use during the Second Intermediate Period and means Overseer of troops or General. For this reason it has been assumed without further evidence that Imyremeshaw was a general before becoming king. Following this hypothesis egyptologists Alan Gardiner and William Hayes translated the entry of the Turin canon referring to Imyremeshaw as Smenkhkare the General i.e. understanding Imyremeshaw as a title rather than a name.4 Jrgen von Beckerath proposes that Imyremeshaw was of foreign origin and had a foreign name that could not be understood by the Egyptians and thus became known to them by his military title.111 Furthermore Imyremeshaw did not use any filiative nominathat is he was apparently not related to his predecessor Khendjer and certainly of nonroyal birth.1 Thus scholars suggested that he may have come to power by orchestrating a military coup against his predecessor Khendjer.4 Baker and Ryholt contest this hypothesis. They point to the lack of evidence for a military coup as one cannot rule out an usurpation by political means. Additionally they note that Imyremeshaw was a common personal name at the time. Similar common names based on titles include Imyrikhwe literally Overseer of cattle Imyreper Steward and Imyrekhenret Overseer of the compound.1 For these reasons Stephen Quirke suggests that the name of Imyremeshaw may simply reflect a family tradition and Ryholt adds that it could indicate a family with a military background.112 Chronological position and reign lengthedit The exact chronological position of Imyremeshaw in the 
13 th Dynasty is not known for certain owing to uncertainties affecting earlier kings of the dynasty. According to the Turin canon Imyremeshaw was the immediate successor of Khendjer. Baker makes him the twentysecond king of the dynasty Ryholt sees him as the twentythird king and Jrgen von Beckerath places him as the eighteenth pharaoh of the dynasty. The exact duration of the reign of Imyremeshaw is mostly lost in a lacuna of the Turin canon and cannot be recovered except for the end and 4 days. Ryholt proposes that the combined reigns of Imyremeshaw and his two successors Sehetepkare Intef and Seth Meribre amount to about 10 years. Another piece of evidence concerning the reign of Imyremeshaw is found in the 
13 th Dynasty Papyrus Boulaq 18 which reports among other things the composition of a royal family comprising ten kings sisters an unspecified number of kings brothers three daughters of the king a son named Redienef and a queen named Aya. Even though the kings name is lost in a lacuna Ryholts analysis of the papyrus only leaves Imyremeshaw and Sehetepkare Intef as possibilities.1 This is significant because the papyrus reports a year 3 and a year 5 dates for this king. Additionally a date regnal year 5 
3 rd month of Shemu 
18 th day is known from the unfinished pyramid complex neighboring that of Khendjer known as Southern South Saqqara pyramid which may thus have been built by the same person perhaps Imyremeshaw.1 The exact circumstances of the end of Imyremeshaws reign are unknown but the fact that his successor Sehetepkare Intef did not use filiative nomina points to a nonroyal birth. Consequently Ryholt proposes that Intef may have usurped the throne.1 Imyremeshaw reigned from Memphis starting in 1759 BC1 or 1711 BC.2 The length of his reign is not known for certain he may have reigned for five years and certainly less than ten years.1 Referencesedit  a b c d e f g h i j k l K.S.B.
