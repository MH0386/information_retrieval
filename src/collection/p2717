11 th dynasty Intef III was the third pharaoh of the Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt during the late First Intermediate Period in the 
21 st century BC at a time when Egypt was divided in two kingdoms. The son of his predecessor Intef II and father of his successor Mentuhotep II7 Intef III reigned for 8 years over Upper Egypt and extended his domain North against the 
10 th Dynasty state perhaps as far north as the 
17 th nome. He undertook some building activity on Elephantine.8 Intef III is buried in a large saff tomb at ElTarif known as Saff elBarqa.9 Familyedit See also Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt family tree Intef III was the son of his predecessor Intef II. This is indicated by the stela of Tjeti chief treasurer during the reigns of Intef II and Intef III. Tjetis stele mentions the death of Intef II and goes on describing how Tjeti served Intef IIs son who acceded to the throne upon the death of his father Then when his son assumed his place Horus NakhtnebTepnefer King of Upper and Lower Egypt Son of Re Intef fashioner of beauty living like Re forever I followed him to all his good seats of pleasure. Intef III possibly married his sister Iah described as a kings mother mwtnswt kings daughter stnswt and priestess of Hathor mtnrwtr.10 This indicates that Intef IIIs successor Mentuhotep II was his son. This is further confirmed by the stele of Henenu Cairo 36346 an official who served under Intef II Intef III and his son which the stele identifies as Horus Sankhibtawy snjbtwy1112 Mentuhotep IIs first Horus name. Another piece of evidence for this parentage is a relief on the Gebel elSilsileh in the Wadi Shatt erRigal known as the Silsileh petroglyph depicting Mentuhotep II surrounded by Iah and Intef III.8 Additionally Mentuhotep IIs royal wife Neferu II bore the title of kings daughter and an inscription in her tomb names her mother as Iah.13 This establishes that she was Intef IIIs daughter and the sister of Mentuhotep II.14 Reignedit Intef IIIs father and predecessor reigned for 49 years and Intef III might thus have acceded to the throne a middleaged8 or even elderly man.1 Although Intef IIIs name is lost in a lacuna of the Turin canon a king list compiled in the early Ramesside period its reign length is still readable on column 5 row 1515 and given as 8 years.81617 The relative chronological position of Intef III as the successor of Intef II and predecessor of Mentuhotep II is secured by his established parentage to these two kings as well as the Turin canon and two blocks from the temple of Montu at Tod.8 These blocks show the succession of kings from Intef I to Mentuhotep II and while Intef IIIs horus name is damaged its position is certain.8 The absolute dating of Intef IIIs reign is less certain and several dates have been proposed 20692061 BC1 20632055 BC4 and 20162009 BC.5 Military activitiesedit Intef III inherited a large and relatively peaceful domain in Upper Egypt.8 Over his 8 years of reign Intef was militarily active.1 He successfully defended the territory that his father Intef II had won as is attested by the tomb of an official of the time Nakhty located at Abydos and in which a doorjamb bearing Intef IIIs names was discovered.8 He also conquered territories north of Abydos in particular Asyut1 and extended his domain perhaps as far as the seventeenth nome of Upper Egypt thereby imposing his familys control over most of Upper Egypt.4 Alternatively this might have been achieved by his son Mentuhotep II early in his reign. Building activitiesedit A doorjamb bearing Intef IIIs name was uncovered on Elephantine in the sanctuary of Hekayeb a deified nomarch of the 
6 th Dynasty which shows that he must have ordered work there.18 Another doorjamb was discovered in the temple of Satet also on Elephantine which attests to building activity on the site.8 Tombedit Coordinates 2544

32.6 3639 Herbert Winlocks 1915 photography of the tomb of Intef III. The tomb was tentatively attributed to Intef II by Winlock and reattributed to Intef III by Arnold.19 The necropolis of the kings of the 
11 th Dynasty is located in ElTarif on the opposite bank of the Nile from Thebes. Several safftombs of imposing dimensions are found there but until the excavations of the German Archaeological Institute under the direction of Dieter Arnold from 1970 until 1974 it was unclear to whom some of these tombs belonged.9 Although no inscriptions could be found in the tombs except that of Intef II to confirm their ownership their positions together with the much laterattested chronological succession of the rulers of the 
11 th Dynasty led to the attribution of the tomb known today as Saff elBaqar9 to Intef III. The tomb resembles that of his predecessor Intef II8 and consists of a 75 m 246 ft wide and 8590 m 279295 ft long courtyard on a northwest  southeast axis facing a canal. The courtyard is surrounded on all sides but the east by many chambers dug into the rock.8920 The courtyard leads to a large doublepillared facade totalling 48 columns behind which many more chambers are located. In spite of the ruined state of the tomb the 19
70 s excavations have shown that its walls must once have been lined with sandstone and adorned with decorations.21 Nowadays the tomb lies beneath the constructions of a village.
