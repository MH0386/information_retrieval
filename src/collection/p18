Using templates Templates are a type of page that contain boilerplate text that is intended to be displayed on more than one page in Wikipedia. This Tip of the day box is an example of a template there are several versions actually and besides being displayed here it is displayed on many userpages as well. Template names start with the prefix Template followed by the page name. The main version of the template you are reading right now is called Templatetotd. To display a template on a page go to the target page click edit and add the templates name with or without the prefix surrounded by double curly brackets to the pages source text. The text you see in the edit box when you click edit this page is called source text because it is a lot like programming code which is called source code. Including a template on a page in this way is called transclusion.
