18 th Dynasty Tutankhamuna or Tutankhamenb c.1341 BC  c.1323 BC was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh who ruled c.1332  1323 BC during the late Eighteenth Dynasty of ancient Egypt. Born Tutankhaten he was likely a son of Akhenaten thought to be the KV55 mummy. His mother was identified through DNA testing as The Younger Lady buried in KV35 she was a full sister of her husband. Tutankhamun acceded to the throne around the age of nine following the short reigns of his predecessors Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten. He married his halfsister Ankhesenpaaten who was probably the mother of his two infant daughters. During his reign he restored the traditional polytheistic form of ancient Egyptian religion undoing the religious shift known as Atenism. His endowments and restorations of cults were recorded on the Restoration Stela. The cult of the god Amun at Thebes was restored to prominence and the royal couple changed their names to Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun removing the aten suffix. Additionally he moved the royal court away from Akhenatens capital Amarna and back to Memphis. He reestablished diplomatic relations with the Mitanni and carried out military campaigns in Nubia and the Near East. Tutankhamun was one of few kings worshipped as a deity during his lifetime. The young king likely began construction of a royal tomb in the Valley of the Kings and an accompanying mortuary temple but both were unfinished at the time of his death. Tutankhamun died unexpectedly aged about 18 his health and the cause of his death have been the subject of much debate. In 2012 it was suggested he died from a combination of malaria and a leg fracture. With his royal tomb incomplete he was instead buried in a small nonroyal tomb adapted for his use. He was succeeded by his vizier Ay. Likely an old man when he became king Ays reign was short being succeeded by Horemheb Tutankhamuns commanderinchief. Under Horemheb the restoration of the traditional ancient Egyptian religion was completed Ay and Tutankhamuns constructions were usurped and earlier Amarna Period rulers were erased. In modern times Tutankhamun is known for the 1922 discovery of his tomb by a team led by British Egyptologist Howard Carter sponsored by British aristocrat George Herbert. Although robbed anciently it retained much of its original contents including the kings undisturbed mummy. The discovery received worldwide press coverage with over 5000 artifacts it gave rise to renewed public interest in ancient Egypt for which Tutankhamuns mask now preserved at the Egyptian Museum remains a popular symbol. Some of his treasure has traveled worldwide with unprecedented response the Egyptian government allowed tours beginning in 1961. The deaths of some individuals who were involved in the excavation have been popularly attributed to the curse of the pharaohs due to the similarity of their circumstances. Since the discovery of his tomb he has been referred to colloquially as King Tut.8 Family See also Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt family tree Tutankhamun and his queen Ankhesenamun Tutankhamun was born in the reign of Akhenaten during the Amarna Period of the late Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. His original name was Tutankhaten or Tutankhuaten meaning living image of Atenc reflecting the shift in ancient Egyptian religion known as Atenism which characterized Akhenatens reign.1011 His parentage is debated as they are not attested in surviving inscriptions. He was certainly a prince as a fragmentary inscription from Hermopolis refers to Tutankhuaten as a kings son.12 He is generally thought to have been the son of Akhenaten12 or his successor Smenkhkare.13 Inscriptions from Tutankhamuns reign treat him as a son of Akhenatens father Amenhotep III but that is only possible if Akhenatens 
17 year reign included a long coregency with his father14 a possibility that many Egyptologists once supported but is now being abandoned.15 His mother has been variously suggested to be Akhenatens chief wife Nefertitid or Akhenatens daughters Meritatene or Meketaten.f Tutankhamun was wet nursed by a woman named Maia known from her tomb at Saqqara.2122 DNA testing identified his father as the mummy from tomb KV55 thought to be Akhenaten and his mother as The Younger Lady an anonymous mummy cached in tomb KV35. His parents were full siblings both being children of Amenhotep III and his chief wife Tiye.
23 g The identity of The Younger Lady is unknown but she cannot be Nefertiti as she was not known to be a sister of Akhenaten.26 However researchers such as Marc Gabolde and Aidan Dodson claim that Nefertiti was indeed Tutankhamuns mother. In this interpretation of the DNA results the genetic closeness is not due to a brothersister pairing but the result of three generations of firstcousin marriage making Nefertiti a first cousin of Akhenaten.27 The validity and reliability of the genetic data from mummified remains has been questioned due to possible degradation due to decay.28 When Tutankhaten became king he married Ankhesenpaaten one of Akhenatens daughters who later changed her name to Ankhesenamun.29 He fathered two daughters who died at or soon after birth and were buried with him in his tomb.23 Computed tomography studies published in 2011 revealed that one daughter was born prematurely at 56 months of pregnancy and the other at fullterm 9 months.30 DNA testing has suggested the anonymous mummy KV
21 A is their mother but the data is not statistically significant enough to allow her to be securely identified as his only known wife Ankhesenamun.23 Tutankhamuns death marked the end of the royal bloodline of the Eighteenth Dynasty.31 Genealogy and population affinities A genetic study published in 2020 revealed Tutankhamun had the haplogroups YDNA R
1 b which originated in western Asia and which today makes up 5060 of the genetic pool of modern Europeans and mtDNA K which originated in the Near East. He shares this Yhaplogroup with his father the KV55 mummy Akhenaten and grandfather Amenhotep III and his mtDNA haplogroup with his mother The Younger Lady his grandmother Tiye and his greatgrandmother Thuya. The profiles for Tutankhamun and Amenhotep III were incomplete and the analysis produced differing probability figures despite having concordant allele results. Because the relationships of these two mummies with the KV55 mummy had previously been confirmed in an earlier study the haplogroup prediction of both mummies could be derived from the full profile of the KV55 data3233 In 2022 S.O.Y. Keita analysed 8 Short Tandem loci STR data originally published by Hawass et al. in studies from 2010 and 2012. The first of these studies had investigated familial relationships among 11 royal mummies of the New Kingdom which included Tutankhamun and Amenhotep III as well as potential inherited disorders and infectious diseases.34 The second of these studies described above had investigated the Yhaplogroups and genetic kinship of Ramesses III and an unknown man buried along with him in the royal cache at Deir el Bahari.35 Keita analysed the STR data from these studies using an algorithm that only has three choices Eurasians subSaharan Africans and East Asians. Using these three options Keita concluded that the majority of the samples had a population affinity with subSaharan Africans in one affinity analysis. However Keita cautioned that this does not mean that the royal mummies lacked other affiliations which he argued had been obscured in typological thinking. Keita further added that different data and algorithms might give different results reflecting the complexity of biological heritage and the associated interpretation.36 Reign The throne of Tutankhamun the Aten depicted above Tutankhamun became pharaoh between eight and nine years of age37 following the short reigns of Akhenatens successors Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten. It is uncertain whether Smenkhkares reign outlasted Akhenatens the female ruler Neferneferuaten is now thought to have become coregent shortly before Akhenatens death and to have reigned for some time after it.3839 On acceding the throne Tutankhamun took the throne name Nebkheperure.40 He reigned for about nine years.41 During Tutankhamuns reign the position of Vizier was split between Upper and Lower Egypt. The principal vizier for Upper Egypt was Usermontu. Another figure named Pentju was also vizier but it is unclear of which lands. It is not entirely known if Ay Tutankhamuns successor actually held this position. A gold foil fragment from KV58 seems to indicate but not certainly that Ay was referred to as a Priest of Maat along with an epithet of vizier doer of maat. The epithet does not fit the usual description used by the regular vizier but might indicate an informal title. It might be that Ay used the title of vizier in an unprecedented manner.42 An Egyptian priest named Manetho wrote a comprehensive history of ancient Egypt where he refers to a king named Orus who ruled for 36 years and had a daughter named Acencheres who reigned twelve years and her brother Rathotis who ruled for only nine years.4344 The Amarna rulers are central in the list but which name corresponds with which historic figure is not agreed upon by researchers. Orus and Acencheres have been identified with Horemheb and Akhenaten and Rathotis with Tutankhamun. The names are also associated with Smenkhkare Amenhotep III Ay and the others in differing order.45 In order for the pharaoh who held divine office to be linked to the people and the gods special epithets were created for them at their accession to the throne. The ancient Egyptian titulary also served to demonstrate ones qualities and link them to the terrestrial realm. The five names were developed over the centuries beginning with the Horus name.h4647 Tutankhamunsi original nomen Tutankhaten48 did not have a Nebty namej or a Gold Falcon namek associated with it9 as nothing has been found with the full fivename protocol.l End of Amarna period Egyptian art of the Amarna period At the beginning of Tutankhatens reign the royal court was still located at Amarna and evidence from his tomb shows that the Aten was still acknowledged.49 But several pieces of evidence suggest that his court was trying to reconcile Atenism with the traditional religion505152 and activity at Amarna decreased during the first four years of his reign.53 These years saw dramatic reversals of Akhenatens policies which given the kings young age must have been instigated by his advisors.54 In the third year of Tutankhatens reign his name was changed to Tutankhamun and that of his queen to Akhesenamun.5556 The Restoration Stela which probably dates to Year 4 of Tutankhamuns reign characterizes the Amarna Period as a time of disaster saying temples and the estates of the gods and goddesses from Elephantine to the marshes of the Delta had fallen into ruin If you asked a god for advice he would not attend and if one spoke to a goddess likewise she would not attend.57 The stela proclaims the rebuilding of the traditional cults58 priests and other members of temple staffs were restored to their former positions.59 Around this time the royal court abandoned Amarna.60 Memphis became the main seat of royal administration60 continuing a trend that dated back to Akhenatens predecessors toward administering the country from that central location rather than the more outlying site of Thebes.61 With Amun restored as Egypts preeminent deity Thebes once again became its greatest center of religious activity.60 Military campaigns Tutankhamun charging enemies 
18 th dynasty The country was economically weak and in turmoil following the reign of Akhenaten. Diplomatic relations with other kingdoms had been neglected and Tutankhamun sought to restore them in particular with the Mitanni. Evidence of his success is suggested by the gifts from various countries found in his tomb. Despite his efforts for improved relations battles with Nubians and Asiatics were recorded in his mortuary temple at Thebes both victories for Egypt.62 Also as far as is known Tutankhamuns military reign was undefeated and is one of several other undefeated reigns in ancient Egypts history. Battle participation The extent to which Tutankhamun participated in battles is an open question and has yet to reach consensus among researchers. On one hand his tomb contained extensive military armament such as bows khopesh swords daggers wristguards maces shields and a club suggesting he had extensive weaponry training. Some imagery while likely figurative does depict Tutankhamun as directly participatory in warfare such as the graphic battle depictions on the painted treasure chest in his tomb. Other artifacts such as the Nine Bows footstool walking sticks and sandals depicting enemies and a gold leaf picture of him during chariot archery against enemies also suggest that he was actively engaged in Egypts international conflict.63 Egyptologist Bob Brier has argued leaning towards Tutankhamun being an actively participating warrior in his later years.64 On the other hand given Tutankhamuns youth and hypothesized physical disabilities like a speculated cane handicap some historians are skeptical that he participated in these battles.65 Yet some experts such as Sofia Aziz Campbell Price and Raksha Dave have taken the position that the speculations of Tutankhamuns physical frailty are overestimated arguing that mummy damage has led to misdiagnosis. Instead they argue that the more rigorous scientific view is that he was physically active and perhaps militarily participatory.66 Egyptologist Charlotte Booth states that Tutankhamun participated in at least two battles one Nubian battle and one Asiatic battle nevertheless noting that other researchers suggest that he may have only accompanied the army to the battlefield for moral support as opposed to actively participating.67 Monuments and construction Tutankhamun enriched and endowed the priestly orders of two important cults initiated a restoration process for old monuments that were damaged during the Amarna Period and reburied his fathers remains in the Valley of the Kings. Given his age the king probably had advisers which presumably included Ay who succeeded Tutankhamun and General Horemheb Ays possible son in law and successor. Horemheb records that the king appointed him lord of the land as hereditary prince to maintain law. He also noted his ability to calm the young king when his temper flared.67 Quartzite statue thought to be of Tutankhamun from temple complex at Medinet Habu In his third regnal year Tutankhamun reversed several changes made during his fathers reign. He ended the worship of the god Aten and restored the god Amun to supremacy. The ban on the cult of Amun was lifted and traditional privileges were restored to its priesthood. The capital was moved back to Thebes and the city of Akhetaten was abandoned.68 As part of the restoration of the traditional cults the king initiated building projects in particular at Karnak in Thebes where he laid out the sphinx avenue leading to the temple of Mut. The sphinxes were originally made for Akhenaten and Nefertiti they were given new ram heads and small statues of the king.69 At Luxor temple he completed the decoration of the entrance colonnade of Amenhotep III.70 Tutankhamun made several endowments that enriched and added to the priestly numbers of the cults of Amun and Ptah. He commissioned new statues of the deities from the best metals and stone and had new processional barques made of the finest cedar from Lebanon and had them embellished with gold and silver.71 A building called the TempleofNebkheperureBelovedofAmunWhoPutsThebesinOrder which may be identical to a building called TempleofNebkheperreinThebes a possible mortuary temple used recycled talatat from Akhenatens east Karnak Aten temples indicating that the dismantling of these temples was already underway.72 Many of Tutankhamuns construction projects were uncompleted at the time of his death and were completed by or usurped by his successors especially Horemheb. The sphinx avenue was completed by his successor Ay and the whole was usurped by Horemheb. The Restoration Stele was usurped by Horemheb pieces of the TempleofNebkheperureinThebes were recycled into Horemhebs own building projects.73 Lifetime deification Kings were venerated after their deaths through mortuary cults and associated temples. Tutankhamun was one of the few kings worshiped in this manner during his lifetime.74 A stela discovered at Karnak and dedicated to AmunRa and Tutankhamun indicates that the king could be appealed to in his deified state for forgiveness and to free the petitioner from an ailment caused by sin. Temples of his cult were built as far away as in Kawa and Faras in Nubia. The title of the sister of the Viceroy of Kush included a reference to the deified king indicative of the universality of his cult.75 Cartouche left Nomen Tutankhamun ruler of Upper Heliopolis.7677 Right Prenomen Nebkheperura.77 Personal life Health issues Scenes from the north wall of the burial chamber of Tutankhamun. On the left side Tutankhamun followed by his ka an aspect of his soul embraces the god of the dead Osiris. In the center Tutankhamun greeting the goddess Nut. On the right side Ay performing the opening of the mouth for Tutankhamun.78 A painted wooden figure of Tutankhamun suggested to be a mannequin for clothing Tutankhamuns health and early death are heavily debated. The most recent study suggests Tutankhamun had bone necrosis and a possible clubfoot which may have rendered him dependent on assistive canes. This theory is disputed as neither the canes nor his sandals show the kinds of the wear expected. He also had other health issues including scoliosis and had contracted several strains of malaria. He likely died of complications from a broken leg possibly compounded by malaria. Tutankhamun was slight of build and roughly 167 cm 5 ft 6 in tall.7980 CT investigations of Tutankhamuns skull revealed an excellent condition of his dentition. He had large front incisors and an overbite characteristic of the Thutmosid royal line to which he belonged.81 Analysis of the clothing found in his tomb particularly the dimensions of his loincloths and belts indicates that he had a narrow waist and rounded hips.82 In attempts to explain both his unusual depiction in art and his early death it has been theorised that Tutankhamun had gynecomastia83 Marfan syndrome WilsonTurner Xlinked intellectual disability syndrome Frhlich syndrome adiposogenital dystrophy Klinefelter syndrome84 androgen insensitivity syndrome aromatase excess syndrome in conjunction with sagittal craniosynostosis syndrome AntleyBixler syndrome or one of its variants.85 It has also been suggested that he had inherited temporal lobe epilepsy in a bid to explain the religiosity of his greatgrandfather Thutmose IV and father Akhenaten and their early deaths.86 However caution has been urged in this diagnosis.87 In January 2005 Tutankhamuns mummy was CT scanned. The results showed that the young king had a partially cleft hard palate and possibly a mild case of scoliosis.8889 Additionally he was diagnosed with a flat right foot with hypophalangism while his left foot was clubbed and had bone necrosis of the second and third metatarsals Freiberg disease or Khler disease II.90 However the clubfoot diagnosis is disputed.91 James Gamble instead suggests that the position is a result of Tutankhamun habitually walking on the outside of his foot due to the pain caused by Khler disease II92 this theory has been refuted by members of Hawass team.93 The condition may have forced Tutankhamun to walk with the use of a cane many of which were found in his tomb.23 However none of them show the wear expected of essential aids the wear on his sandals where present is also even on both feet.94 The presence of such a number of sticks is not unexpected as canes were a symbol of status in ancient Egypt.95 Genetic testing through STR analysis rejected the hypothesis of gynecomastia and craniosynostoses e.g. AntleyBixler syndrome or Marfan syndrome.65 Genetic testing for STEVOR AMA1 or MSP1 genes specific for Plasmodium falciparum revealed indications of malaria tropica in 4 mummies including Tutankhamuns.65 This is currently the oldest known genetic proof of the ailment.96 The team discovered DNA from several strains of the parasite indicating that he was repeatedly infected with the most severe strain of malaria. His malaria infections may have caused a fatal immune response in the body or triggered circulatory shock.97 The CT scan also showed that he had experienced a compound left leg fracture. This injury being the result of modern damage was ruled out based on the ragged edges of the fracture modern damage features sharp edges. Embalming substances were present within the fracture indicating that it was associated with an open wound no signs of healing were present.98 Facial reconstruction Closeup of Tutankhamuns mummified head A facial reconstruction of Tutankhamun was carried out in 2005 by the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities and National Geographic. Three separate teamsEgyptian French and Americanworked separately to approximate the face of the boy king. While the Egyptian and French teams knew their subject was Tutankhamun the American team worked blind. All teams produced very similar results but it was that of the French team that was ultimately cast in silicone.99100 Criticism Stuart Tyson Smith Egyptologist and professor of anthropology at University of California Santa Barbara in 2008 expressed criticism of the forensic reconstruction in a journal review. He noted that Tutankhamuns face was depicted as very lightskinned reflecting a bias among media outlets. Smith further added that Egyptologists have been strangely reluctant to admit that the ancient Egyptians were rather darkskinned Africans especially the farther south one goes.101 Death There are no surviving records of the circumstances of Tutankhamuns death it has been the subject of considerable debate and major studies.102 Hawass and his team postulate that his death was likely the result of the combination of his multiple weakening disorders a leg fracture perhaps as the result of a fall and a severe malarial infection.103 However Timmann and Meyer have argued that sickle cell anemia better fits the pathologies exhibited by the king104 a suggestion the Egyptian team has called interesting and plausible.105 Murder by a blow to the head was theorised as a result of the 1968 xray which showed two bone fragments inside the skull.106 This theory was disproved by further analysis of the xrays and the CT scan. The intercranial bone fragments were determined to be the result of the modern unwrapping of the mummy as they are loose and not adherent to the embalming resin.107 No evidence of bone thinning or calcified membranes which could be indicative of a fatal blow to the head were found.108 It has also been suggested that the young king was killed in a chariot accident due to a pattern of crushing injuries including the fact that the front part of his chest wall and ribs are missing.109110 However the missing ribs are unlikely to be a result of an injury sustained at the time of death photographs taken at the conclusion of Carters excavation in 1926 show that the chest wall of the king was intact still wearing a beaded collar with falconheaded terminals. The absence of both the collar and chest wall was noted in the 1968 xray111 and further confirmed by the CT scan.89 It is likely that the front part of his chest was removed by robbers during the theft of the beaded collar the intricate beaded skullcap the king was pictured wearing in 1926 was also missing by 19
68.1 12 Succession Since the two children of Tutankhamun and his sisterwife queen Ankhesenamun were both born stillborn and Tutankhamun was the last of the royal male siblings there was no immediate heir apparent to assume the throne as Ankhesenamuns husband. Records in Horemhebs tomb state that Tutankhamun appointed him lord of the land as Irypat heir designate which is essentially the designated hereditary prince to maintain law. However queen Ankhesenamun preferred to not marry someone of lesser status than royal queen status. Horemheb was a militaryman of peasant birth and was as the military commanderinchief technically a servant of queen Ankhesenamun. The vizier Ay while of some royal blood was an established vizier and also technically a servant of queen Ankhesenamun. Ankhesenamuns preference ignited a series of disruption in the fulfillment of king Tutankhamuns will on throne heirship.113 Reign of vizier Ay Ankhesenamun generated a predicament involving the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I and his son prince Zannanza known as the Zannanza affair. Meanwhile Tutankhamuns vizier maneuvered in the midst of Tutankhamuns death to intercept the throne circumventing Horemhebs rightful heirship marrying Ankhesenamun towards the onset of this HittiteEgyptian negotiation period unbeknownst to Hittites. The fact that Ay is depicted presiding over Tutankhamuns funeral which is customary for the successor pharaoh and the fact that Horemheb appears to have been absent at Tutankhamuns funeral aligns with this.114 The pharaoh Ays reign was abruptly short and his death again left a vacancy in the throne with no royal bloodline heir because Ay did not have children with queen Ankhesenamun. Despite the fact that toward the end of his reign Ay named his son military generalissimo Nakhtmin to be successor to the throne Nakhtmin never became pharaoh because he died before he could.115 Horemheb Irypat fulfillment Ultimately as prescribed by the will of Tutankhamun Horemheb succeeded the throne as pharaoh likely marrying Ankhesenamun. The marriage was brief as Ankhesenamun died only a couple years into Horemhebs lengthy reign. Horemheb never had any children with Ankhesenamun and with her death the royal bloodline of Tutankhamun had completely came to a halt. As pharaoh Horemheb saw to it that the restoration of the traditional ancient Egyptian religion that Tutankhamun was previously spearheading was completed restabilizing the nation. Notably during the standard damnatio memoriae process that each new Egyptian pharaoh undertakes Horemheb defaced Ays tomb but left Tutankhamuns untouched presumably out of respect.116 In due course Horemheb had selected then civilian military officer Ramesses I as heir to the throne who already had a grandson Ramesses II who would then go on to found the Ramesside dynasty and become the greatest pharaoh of ancient Egypt.116 This initiated a new royal bloodline that replaced the royal bloodline that ended with the death of Tutankhamun. Tomb Main article Tomb of Tutankhamun The wall decorations in KV
62 s burial chamber are modest in comparison with other royal tombs found in the Valley of the Kings Tutankhamun was buried in a tomb that was unusually small considering his status. His death may have occurred unexpectedly before the completion of a grander royal tomb causing his mummy to be buried in a tomb intended for someone else. This would preserve the observance of the customary 70 days between death and burial.117 His tomb was robbed at least twice in antiquity but based on the items taken including perishable oils and perfumes and the evidence of restoration of the tomb after the intrusions these robberies likely took place within several months at most of the initial burial. The location of the tomb was lost because it had come to be buried by debris from subsequent tombs and workers houses were built over the tomb entrance.118 Rediscovery Main article Discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun George Herbert 
5 th Earl of Carnarvon 1921 The concession rights for excavating the Valley of the Kings was held by Theodore Davis from 1905 until 1914. In that time he had unearthed ten tombs including the nearly intact but nonroyal tomb of Queen Tiyes parents Yuya and Thuya. As he continued working there in the later years he uncovered nothing of major significance.119 Davis did find several objects in KV58 referring to Tutankhamun which included knobs and handles bearing his name most significantly the embalming cache of the king KV54. He believed this to be the pharaohs lost tomb and published his findings as such with the line I fear the Valley of the Tombs is exhausted.120121 In 1907 Howard Carter was invited by William Garstin and Gaston Maspero to excavate for George Herbert 
5 th Earl of Carnarvon in the Valley. The Earl of Carnarvon and Carter had hoped this would lead to their gaining the concession when Davis gave it up but had to be satisfied with excavations in different parts of the Theban Necropolis for seven more years.122 After a systematic search beginning in 1915 Carter discovered the actual tomb of Tutankhamun KV62 in November 19
22.1 23 An ancient stroke of luck allowed the tomb to survive to modern times. The tombs entrance was buried by mounds of debris from the cutting of KV9 over 150 years after Tutankhamuns burial ancient workmens huts were also built on the site.124125 This area remained unexcavated until 1922 due to its proximity to KV9 as excavations would impede tourist access to that tomb.126 Carter commenced excavations in early November 1922 before the height of the tourist season.127 The first step of the tombs entrance staircase was uncovered on 4 November 1922. According to Carters account the workmen discovered the step while digging beneath the remains of the huts other accounts attribute the discovery to a boy digging outside the assigned work area.1
28 m By February 1923 the antechamber had been cleared of everything but two sentinel statues. A day and time were selected to unseal the tomb with about twenty appointed witnesses that included Lord Carnarvon several Egyptian officials museum representatives and the staff of the Government Press Bureau. On 17 February 1923 at just after two oclock the seal was broken.132 Letters published in 2022 of correspondence between Rex Engelbach and Alan Gardiner reveal that Howard Carter had stolen objects from the tomb such as a whm amulet before the tomb was officially opened. Rex Engelbach said in a letter to Gardiner about a whm amulet gifted to Gardiner from Carter that The whm amulet you showed me has been undoubtedly stolen from the tomb of Tutankhamun.133 Contents Main articles Mask of Tutankhamun and Tomb of Tutankhamun An alabaster stopper from his canopic chest Tutankhamuns tomb is the only royal tomb in the Valley of the Kings found in nearintact condition.134 There were 5398 items found in the tomb including a solid gold coffin face mask thrones archery bows trumpets a lotus chalice two Imiut fetishes gold toe stalls furniture food wine sandals and fresh linen underwear. Howard Carter took 10 years to catalog the items.135 Recent analysis suggests a dagger recovered from the tomb had an iron blade made from a meteorite study of artifacts of the time including other artifacts from Tutankhamuns tomb could provide valuable insights into metalworking technologies around the Mediterranean at the time.136137 Complete study of the iron artefacts from the tomb besides the blade of a richly decorated golden dagger small iron chisel blades set into wooden handles an Eye of Horus amulet and a miniature headrest demonstrated that all were made of similar material.138 Only in 2022 a complex technological and material study of the Tutankhamuns mask was published.139 Many of Tutankhamuns burial goods show signs of being adapted for his use after being originally made for earlier owners probably Smenkhkare or Neferneferuaten or both.140141142 On 4 November 2007 85 years to the day after Carters discovery Tutankhamuns mummy was placed on display in his underground tomb at Luxor when the linenwrapped mummy was removed from its golden sarcophagus to a climatecontrolled glass box. The case was designed to prevent the heightened rate of decomposition caused by the humidity and warmth from tourists visiting the tomb.143 In 2009 the tomb was closed for restoration by the Ministry of Antiquities and the Getty Conservation Institute. While the closure was originally planned for five years to restore the walls affected by humidity the Egyptian revolution of 2011 set the project back. The tomb reopened in February 20
19.1 44 Rumored curse Howard Carter examining the innermost coffin of Tutankhamun 1925 For many years rumors of a curse of the pharaohs probably fueled by newspapers seeking sales at the time of the discovery145 persisted emphasizing the early death of some of those who had entered the tomb. The most prominent was George Herbert 
5 th Earl of Carnarvon who died on 5 April 1923 five months after the discovery of the first step leading down to the tomb on 4 November 19
22.1 46 The cause of Carnarvons death was pneumonia supervening on facial erysipelas a streptococcal infection of the skin and underlying soft tissue.147 The Earl had been in an automobile accident in 1901 making him very unhealthy and frail. His doctor recommended a warmer climate so in 1903 the Carnarvons traveled to Egypt where the Earl became interested in Egyptology.146 Along with the stresses of the excavation Carnarvon was already in a weakened state when an infection led to pneumonia.148 A study showed that of the 58 people who were present when the tomb and sarcophagus were opened only eight died within a dozen years149 Howard Carter died of lymphoma in 1939 at the age of 
64.1 50 The last survivors included Lady Evelyn Herbert Lord Carnarvons daughter who was among the first people to enter the tomb after its discovery in November 1922 who lived for a further 57 years and died in 1980151 and American archaeologist J.O. Kinnaman who died in 1961 39 years after the event.152 Legacy The Egyptian Number of Life 19 April 1923 Tutankhamuns fame is primarily the result of his wellpreserved tomb and the global exhibitions of his associated artifacts. As Jon Manchip White writes in his foreword to the 1977 edition of Carters The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamun The pharaoh who in life was one of the least esteemed of Egypts Pharaohs has become in death the most renowned.153 The discoveries in the tomb were prominent news in the 19
20 s. Tutankhamen came to be called by a modern neologism King Tut. Ancient Egyptian references became common in popular culture including Tin Pan Alley songs the most popular of the latter was Old King Tut by Harry Von Tilzer from 1923154155 which was recorded by such prominent artists of the time as Jones  Hare156 and Sophie Tucker.154 King Tut became the name of products businesses and the pet dog of U.S. President Herbert Hoover.157 While The Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibit was touring the United States in 1978 comedian Steve Martin wrote a novelty song King Tut. Originally performed on Saturday Night Live the song was released as a single and sold over a million copies.158 In 2023 an extinct whale discovered in the Eocene deposits of Egypt was named Tutcetus after Tutankhamun due to the small size and immature age of the type specimen.159 International exhibitions Further information Exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun San Franciscos M. H. de Young Memorial Museum hosted an exhibition of Tutankhamun artifacts in 2009160 Tutankhamuns artifacts have traveled the world with unprecedented visitorship.161 The exhibitions began in 1962 when Algeria won its independence from France. With the ending of that conflict the Louvre Museum in Paris was quickly able to arrange an exhibition of Tutankhamuns treasures through Christiane Desroches Noblecourt. The French Egyptologist was already in Egypt as part of a UNESCO appointment. The French exhibit drew 
1.2  million visitors. Noblecourt had also convinced the Egyptian Minister of Culture to allow British photographer George Rainbird to rephotograph the collection in color. The new color photos as well as the Louvre exhibition began a Tutankhamun revival.162 In 1965 the Tutankhamun exhibit traveled to Tokyo National Museum in Tokyo Japan 21 August10 October163 where it garnered more visitors than the future New York exhibit in 1979. The exhibit next moved to the Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art in Kyoto 15 October28 November163 with almost 
1.7 5 million visitors and then to the Fukuoka Prefectural Cultural Hall in Fukuoka 3 December26 December.163 The blockbuster attraction exceeded all other exhibitions of Tutankhamuns treasures for the next 60 years.161164 The Treasures of Tutankhamun tour ran from 1972 to 1979. This exhibition was first shown in London at the British Museum from 30 March until 30 September 1972. More than 
1.6  million visitors saw the exhibition.161165 The exhibition moved on to many other countries including the United States Soviet Union Japan France Canada and West Germany. The Metropolitan Museum of Art organized the U.S. exhibition which ran from 17 November 1976 through 15 April 1979. More than eight million attended.166167 The showing in the United States was part of a diplomatic effort begun by Henry Kissinger to further convince Americans of the value of Egypt as an ally. It traveled first to Washington D.C. then Chicago New Orleans Los Angeles and Seattle and finished in New York.168 In 2005 Egypts Supreme Council of Antiquities in partnership with Arts and Exhibitions International and the National Geographic Society launched a tour of Tutankhamun treasures and other 
18 th Dynasty funerary objects this time called Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs. It featured the same exhibits as Tutankhamen The Golden Hereafter in a slightly different format. It was expected to draw more than three million people but exceeded that with almost four million people attending just the first four tour stops.169 The exhibition started in Los Angeles then moved to Fort Lauderdale Chicago Philadelphia and London before finally returning to Egypt in August 2008. An encore of the exhibition in the United States ran at the Dallas Museum of Art.170 After Dallas the exhibition moved to the de Young Museum in San Francisco followed by the Discovery Times Square Exposition in New York City.171 Tutankhamun exhibition in 2018 The exhibition visited Australia for the first time opening at the Melbourne Museum for its only Australian stop before Egypts treasures returned to Cairo in December 20
11.1 72 The exhibition included 80 exhibits from the reigns of Tutankhamuns immediate predecessors in the 
18 th Dynasty such as Hatshepsut whose trade policies greatly increased the wealth of that dynasty and enabled the lavish wealth of Tutankhamuns burial artifacts as well as 50 from Tutankhamuns tomb. The exhibition did not include the gold mask that was a feature of the 19721979 tour as the Egyptian government has decided that damage which occurred to previous artifacts on tours precludes this one from joining them.173 In 2018 it was announced that the largest collection of Tutankhamun artifacts amounting to forty percent of the entire collection would be leaving Egypt again in 2019 for an international tour entitled King Tut Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh.174 The 20192022 tour began with an exhibit called Tutankhamun Pharaohs Treasures which launched in Los Angeles and then traveled to Paris. The exhibit featured at the Grande Halle de la Villette in Paris ran from March to September 2019. The exhibit featured one hundred and fifty gold coins along with various pieces of jewelry sculpture and carvings as well as the renowned gold mask of Tutankhamun. Promotion of the exhibit filled the streets of Paris with posters of the event. The exhibit moved to London in November 2019 and was scheduled to travel to Boston and Sydney when the COVID19 pandemic interrupted the tour. On 28 August 2020 the artifacts that made up the temporary exhibition returned to the Egyptian Museum Cairo and other institutions.175 The treasures will be permanently housed in the new Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo expected to open between October 2023 and February 20

English Egyptologist Battiscombe Gunn believed that the older interpretation did not fit with Akhenatens theology. Gunn believed that such a name would have been blasphemous. He saw tut as a verb and not a noun and gave his translation in 1926 as ThelifeofAtenispleasing. Professor Gerhard Fecht also believed the word tut was a verb. He noted that Akhenaten used tit as a word for image not tut. Fecht translated the verb tut as To be perfectcomplete. Using Aten as the subject Fechts full translation was OneperfectoflifeisAten. The Hermopolis Block two carved block fragments discovered in Ashmunein has a unique spelling of the first nomen written as Tutankhuaten it uses ankh as a verb which does support the older translation of LivingimageofAten.9  Part of this interpretation is based on the inscribed block from Hermopolis which names a Kings Son in conjunction with a Kings Daughter.16 Princes were not commonly depicted in the Eighteenth Dynasty so it is argued depictions of daughters does not necessarily mean Nefertiti did not have a son.17  His parents are suggested to be Meritaten and her known husband Smenkhkare based on a reexamination of a box lid and coronation tunic found in his tomb.18  Meketatens candidacy is based on a relief from the Royal Tomb at Amarna which depicts a child in the arms of a nurse outside a chamber in which Meketaten is being mourned by her parents and siblings which has been interpreted to indicate she died in childbirth.19 This possibility has been deemed unlikely given that she was about 10 years old at the time of her death.20  The team reported it was over 
99.9 9 percent certain that Amenhotep III was the father of the individual in KV55 who was in turn the father of Tutankhamun.24 More recent genetic analysis published in 2020 revealed Tutankhamun shared his Yhaplogroup with his father the KV55 mummy Akhenaten and grandfather Amenhotep III and his mtDNA haplogroup with his mother The Younger Lady his grandmother Tiye and his greatgrandmother Thuya upholding the results of the earlier genetic study.25  Tutankhamuns Horus Name was Ka nakht tut mesut3 translated as Victorious bull the very image of rebirth.5  His second full nomen also called the Son of Re Name was Tut ankh imen heqa iunu shemau translated as The living image of Amun Ruler of Southern Heliopolis.5  Tutankahmuns Nebty or Two Ladies Name was 1 Nefer hepu segereh tawy3 translated as Perfect of laws who has quieted down the Two Lands.5 2 Nefer hepu segereh tawy sehetep netjeru nebu translated as Perfect of laws who has quieted down the Two Lands and pacified all the gods.5 3 Wer ah imen translated as The great one of the palace of Amun.47  Tutankhamuns Gold Falcon Name was 1 Wetjes khau sehetep netjeru3 translated as Elevated of appearances who has satisfied the gods.5 Gold Falcon name 2 Wetjes khau it ef ra translates as Who has elevated the appearances of his father Re.47  Tutankhamuns Prenomen Throne Name was Neb kheperu re347 translated as The possessor of the manifestation of Re.5 which had an epithet added Heqa maat translated as Ruler of Maat.47  Karl Kitchen a reporter for the Boston Globe wrote in 1924 that a boy named Mohamed Gorgar had found the step he interviewed Gorgar who did not say whether the story was true.129 Lee Keedick the organiser of Carters American lecture tour said Carter attributed the discovery to an unnamed boy carrying water for the workmen.130 Many recent accounts such as the 2018 book Tutankhamun Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh by the Egyptologist Zahi Hawass identify the waterboy as Hussein Abd elRassul a member of a prominent local family. Hawass says he heard this story from elRassul in person. Another Egyptologist Christina Riggs suggests the story may instead be a conflation of Keedicks account which was widely publicised by the 1978 book Tutankhamun The Untold Story by Thomas Hoving with elRassuls longstanding claim to have been the boy who was photographed wearing one of Tutankhamuns pectorals in 19
