He is credited with a reign of 24 to 35 years depending on the scholar and likely lived in the second half of the 
25 th century BCE. Nyuserre was the younger son of Neferirkare Kakai and queen Khentkaus II and the brother of the shortlived king Neferefre. He may have succeeded his brother directly as indicated by much later historical sources. Alternatively Shepseskare may have reigned between the two as advocated by Miroslav Verner albeit only for a few weeks or months at the most. The relation of Shepseskare with Neferefre and Nyuserre remains highly uncertain. Nyuserre was in turn succeeded by Menkauhor Kaiu who could have been his nephew and a son of Neferefre. Nyuserre was the most prolific builder of his dynasty having built three pyramids for himself and his queens and completed a further three for his father mother and brother all in the necropolis of Abusir. He built the largest surviving temple to the sun god Ra constructed during the Old Kingdom named Shesepibre or Joy of the heart of Ra. He also completed the Nekhenre the Sun temple of Userkaf in Abu Gorab and the valley temple of Menkaure in Giza. In doing so he was the first king since Shepseskaf last ruler of the Fourth Dynasty to pay attention to the Giza necropolis a move which may have been an attempt to legitimise his rule following the troubled times surrounding the unexpected death of his brother Neferefre. There is little evidence for military action during Nyuserres reign the Egyptian state continued to maintain trade relations with Byblos on the Levantine coast and to send mining and quarrying expeditions to Sinai and Lower Nubia. Nyuserres reign saw the growth of the administration and the effective birth of the nomarchs provincial governors who for the first time were sent to live in the provinces they administered rather than at the pharaohs court. As with other Old Kingdom pharaohs Nyuserre benefited from a funerary cult established at his death. In Nyuserres case this official statesponsored cult existed for centuries surviving the chaotic First Intermediate Period and lasting until the Twelfth Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom. In parallel a spontaneous popular cult appeared with people venerating Nyuserre under his birth name Iny. In this cult Nyuserre played a role similar to that of a saint being invoked as an intercessor between the believer and the gods. It left little archaeological evidence and seems to have continued until the New Kingdom nearly 1000 years after his death. Sourcesedit Contemporaneous sourcesedit Nyuserre Ini is well attested in sources contemporaneous with his reignnote 3 for example in the tombs of some of his contemporaries including Nyuserres manicurists Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum the high officials Khufukhaf II Ty Rashepses Neferefreankh and Khabawptah2930 and the priests of his funerary cult Nimaatsed and Kaemnefert.3132 Historical sourcesedit Nyuserre is attested in three ancient Egyptian king lists all dating to the New Kingdom. The earliest of these is the Karnak king list which was commissioned by Thutmose III fl. 14791425 BCE to honour some of his forebears and which mentions Nyuserre in the fourth entry which shows his birth name Iny in a cartouche.33 Nyuserres prenomen occupies the 
30 th entry of the Abydos King List written nearly 200 years later during the reign of Seti I fl. 12901279 BCE. Nyuserres prenomen was most likely also given on the Turin canon third column 
22 nd row dating to the reign of Ramses II fl. 12791213 BCE but it has since been lost in a large lacuna affecting the document. Fragments of his reign length are still visible on the papyrus indicating a reign of somewhere between 11 and 34 years.34 Nyuserre is the only Fifth Dynasty king absent from the Saqqara Tablet.35 Nyuserre was also mentioned in the Aegyptiaca a history of Egypt probably written in the 
3 rd century BCE during the reign of Ptolemy II fl. 283246 BCE by the Egyptian priest Manetho. Even though no copies of the text survive it is known through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. In particular Africanus relates that the Aegyptiaca mentioned a pharaoh  that is Rathurs reigning for fortyfour years as the sixth king of the Fifth Dynasty.36 Rathurs is believed to be the Hellenised form of Nyuserre.37 Reignedit Neferefre Nyuserres elder brother died unexpectedly in his early twenties after a short reign. Accession to the throneedit Two competing hypotheses exist in Egyptology to describe the succession of events running from the death of Neferirkare Kakai the third king of the Fifth Dynasty to the coronation of Nyuserre Ini the sixth ruler of the dynasty. Relying on historical sources where Nyuserre is said to have directly succeeded Neferefre many Egyptologists such as Jrgen von Beckerath and Hartwig Altenmller have traditionally believed38 that the following succession took place Neferirkare Kakai  Shepseskare  Neferefre  Nyuserre Ini. In this scenario Neferefre is the father of Nyuserre who would have become pharaoh after Neferefres unexpected death.439 Neferefre would be the successor of Shepseskare credited with seven years of reign as indicated in Manethos Aegyptiaca.36 This view was challenged most notably by Miroslav Verner in 2000 and 2001404142 following excavations of the Abusir necropolis which indicated that Neferefres purported predecessor Shepseskare most likely reigned for only a few months between Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini. Verner proposes that the royal succession was Neferirkare Kakai  Neferefre  Shepseskare  Nyuserre Ini. In support of this hypothesis is Verners observation that Neferefre and Nyuserre were very likely full brothers both sons of Neferirkare Kakainote 4 There is also evidence that Neferefre was Neferirkares eldest son and in his early twenties at the death of his father and thus would have been likely to inherit the throne.44 These observations in addition to further archaeological evidence such as the lack of a pyramid of Shepseskare and the position of Neferefres own convinced Verner that Neferefre directly succeeded his father dying after a very short reign of about two years.44 Nyuserre was then still a child and in this hypothesis his claim to the throne faced a serious challenge in the person of his possible uncle Shepseskare who might have been a son of Sahure. Alternatively Shepseskare may have been a shortlived son of Neferefre45 or less likely an usurper from outside the royal family.46 In any case Shepseskare apparently succeeded in holding the crown for a short time. Nyuserre ultimately prevailed however either because of Shepseskares own premature death or because he was backed by powerful high officials and members of the royal family47 foremost among whom were his mother Khentkaus II and Ptahshepses.1 This latter hypothesis is motivated by the exalted positions that both individuals seem to have enjoyed. The mortuary temple of Khentkaus II was designed to imitate that of a king for example by incorporating its own satellite pyramid and having an alignment on an eastwest axis.48 These features together with Khentkaus II peculiar title of Mwt Nisw bity Nisw bity originally translated by Mother of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt exercising office as the king of Upper and Lower Egypt led some scholars including Verner to propose that she might even have reigned in her own right.48 This hypothesis is now deemed unlikely and her title is rather translated as Mother of two kings of Upper and Lower Egypt.note 5 Ptahshepses became vizier under Nyuserre49 whose daughter he married received the honorary title of Kings sonnote 6 and was buried in one of the largest private tombs in Egypt.51 According to Verner and Nigel Strudwick the architectural elements52 of this tomb such as its lotusbud columns similar to those used in Nyuserres own temple boat pits and layout of the burial chamber5351 demonstrate the favor shown by that king to his soninlaw.535154 Reign lengthedit Fragmentary statue of a Fifth Dynasty king likely Nyuserre25 Historical and archaeological evidenceedit Manethos Aegyptiaca related that Nyuserre reigned for 44 years a figure which is rejected by Egyptologists who rather credit him with about three decades of reign37 owing to the paucity of secure dates for his rule.note 756 The entry of the Turin canon pertaining to Nyuserre is damaged and the duration of his rule is difficult to read with certainty. Following Alan Gardiners 1959 study of the canon57 scholars such as Nigel Strudwick credited Nyuserre with 1115 years of reign.note 8 Gardiners reading of the canon was then reevaluated from facsimiles yielding a 24 to 25 years figure for Nyuserres reign. This duration is accepted by some scholars including Nicolas Grimal.58 More recent analyses of the original papyrus conducted by Kim Ryholt have shown that Nyuserres reign length as reported on the document could equally be 1114 2124 or 3134 years.note 934 The later figure is now favoured by Egyptologists including Strudwick and Verner.56 The view that Nyuserre reigned in excess of twenty years is furthermore supported by archaeological evidence which points to a fairly long reign for him. Verner who has been excavating the Abusir necropolis on behalf of the University of Prague since 1976 points in particular to Nyuserres numerous constructions amounting to no less than three new pyramids the completion of a further three the construction of the largest sun temple built during the Old Kingdom.17 Nyuserres Sed festivaledit Relief of Nyuserre celebrating his Sed festival Egyptian Museum of Berlin The hypothesis of a reign more than three decades long for Nyuserre Ini is supported albeit indirectly by reliefs discovered in his solar temple showing him participating in a Sed festival. This festival was meant to rejuvenate the king and was normally though not always first celebrated after 30 years of rule. Representations of the festival were part of the typical decorations of temples associated to the king during the Old Kingdom17 and mere depictions of it do not necessarily imply a long reign.note 10 For example a relief showing Sahure in the tunic of the Sed festival has been found in his mortuary temple5960 although both historical sources and archeological evidence agree that he ruled Egypt for less than 14 full years.611213 Yet in Nyuserres case these reliefs taken together with the archaeological evidence have convinced most Egyptologists that Nyuserre enjoyed over 30 years of reign and that the sedfestival scenes from Abu Gurab most probably reflect the 
30 th jubilee of the kings accession to the throne.17 The reliefs of Nyuserres Sed festival offer a rare glimpse into the ritual acts carried out during this ceremony. In particular the festival seems to have involved a procession in a barque over a body of water6263 a detail either not represented or lost in all subsequent representations of the festival until the reign of Amenhotep III fl. c. 13901350 BCE over 1000 years after Nyuserres lifetime.63 Domestic activitiesedit Ptahshepses vizier and son in law of Nyuserre Ini The reign of Nyuserre Ini witnessed the unabated growth of the priesthood and state bureaucracy164 a phenomenon which had started in the early Fifth Dynasty65 in particular under Neferirkare Kakai.66 Changes in the Egyptian administration during this period are manifested by a multiplication in the number of titles reflecting the creation of new administrative offices.66 These in turn reflect a movement to better organise the administration of the state with the new titles corresponding to charges attached to very specific duties.66 The kings power slowly weakened as the bureaucracy expandednote 11 although he remained a living god in the eyes of his subjects.
1 This situation went unchecked until the reign of Nyuserres second successor Djedkare Isesi who implemented the first comprehensive reforms of the system of ranking titles and thus of the administration.71 There are two pieces of direct evidence of administrative activities during Nyuserres reign. The first is that the Old Kingdom royal annals of which only fragments survive are believed to have been composed during his reign. The annals which give details on the reigns of kings from the First Dynasty onwards on a yearbyyear basis72 are damaged and break off following the reign of Neferirkare Kakai. The second piece of evidence for administrative activity relates to the provincial administration. During the Old Kingdom the Egyptian state was divided administratively into provinces called nomes. These provinces were recognised as such since the time of Djoser founder of the Third Dynasty and probably harked back to the predynastic kingdoms of the Nile valley.73 The earliest topographical lists of the nomes of Upper and Lower Egypt date back to the reign of Nyuserre73 a procession of personified nomes being depicted on reliefs from Nyuserres sun temple.74 It is also around this time that the nomarchs started to reside in their province rather than at the royal residence.65 Activities outside Egyptedit Trade and mining expeditionsedit Relief of Nyuserre from the Wadi Maghareh To the north of Egypt trade contacts with Byblos on the Levantine coast which existed during much of the Fifth Dynasty were seemingly active during Nyuserres reign as suggested by a fragment of cylindrical alabaster vase bearing his name uncovered in the city.7576 East of Egypt Nyuserre commissioned at least one expedition to the Wadi Maghareh in Sinai77 where mines of copper and turquoise were exploited during much of the Old Kingdom.78 This expedition left a large rock relief now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.note 12 The relief shows Nyuserre smiting the Bedouinsnote 13 of all foreign lands the great god lord of the two lands.79 At the right of Nyuserre is a dedication to Thoth lord of the foreign lands who has made pure libations.79 This expedition departed Egypt from the port of Ain Sukhna on the western shore of the Gulf of Suez as revealed by seal impressions bearing Nyuserres name found on the site.80 The port comprised large galleries carved into the sandstone serving as living quarters and storage places. The wall of one such gallery was inscribed with a text in ink mentioning the expedition to Sinai and dating it to the year of the second cattle count  possibly Nyuserres fourth year on the throne.81 To the south of Egypt in Lower Nubia Nyuserre exploited the gneiss quarries of Gebel elAsr near Aswan which provided material for buildings and statuesnote 14 as shown by a fragmentary stone stela inscribed with Nyuserres Horus name that was discovered in a settlement adjacent to the quarries.82 Military activityedit There is little evidence for military action during Nyuserres reign. William C. Hayes proposed that a few fragmentary limestone statues of kneeling and bound prisoners of war discovered in his mortuary temple8384 possibly attest to punitive raids in Libya to the west or the Sinai and Palestine to the east during his reign.85 The art historian William Stevenson Smith has pointed out that such statues were customary83 elements of the decoration of royal temples and mastabas suggesting that they may not be immediately related to actual military campaigns. Similar statues and small wooden figures of kneeling captives were discovered in the mortuary complexes of Neferefre86 Djedkare Isesi87 Unas88 Teti89 Pepi I90 and Pepi II83 as well as in the tomb of vizier Senedjemib Mehi.9192 Main building activitiesedit Tomb relief of Iny excavated at Saqqara Assuming Verners reconstruction of the Fifth Dynasty royal family Nyuserre Ini faced an enormous task when he ascended the throne his father mother and brother had all left their pyramids unfinished93 his fathers and brothers sun temples were unfinished too and he had to construct his own pyramid as well as those of his queens. Nyuserre met this challenge by placing his pyramid in the immediate vicinity of the unfinished ones on the northeastern corner of that of Neferirkare Kakai and next to that of Sahure thereby concentrating all pyramid building activities in South Abusir93 in an area of 300 m  300 m 980 ft  980 ft.94 This meant that his pyramid was out of the alignment formed by the preceding ones limited its size and constrained the layout of his mortuary complex.9596 This would explain why despite having enjoyed one of the longest reigns of the Fifth Dynasty Nyuserres pyramid was smaller than that of his father and closer in size to that of his grandfather Sahure.96 Builders and artisans who worked on Nyuserres constructions projects lived in the pyramid town EnduringarethecultplacesofNiuserre which was very likely located in Abusir between the causeways of Sahure and Nyuserre.97 Pyramid of Nyuserreedit Main article Pyramid of Nyuserre The pyramid of Nyuserre Ini in Abusir Nyuserre built a pyramid for himself at Abusir named Mensut Nyuserrenote 15 meaning Established are the places of Nyuserre99 or The places of Nyuserre endure.4 The completed pyramid was entirely covered in fine limestone. It was about 52 m 171 ft tall with a base of 
78.8  m 259 ft along each side100 a slope of 52 degrees and a total volume of stone of about 112000 m3 4000000 cu ft. The burial chamber and antechamber were both lined with fine limestone as well and roofed with three tiers of gigantic limestone beams 10 m 33 ft long weighing 90 tons each.96 The pyramid complex is unusual as the outer sections of the mortuary temple are offset to the south of the eastern side of the complex. This allowed Nyuserre to intercept and complete his fathers causeway which led from the valley temple close to the Nile to the pyramid itself on the desert edge. The valley temple of Nyuserre was thus built on the foundations laid by his father for his own unfinished valley temple. Once completed it consisted of a portico with eight papyriform columns its floor was of black basalt and its walls were made of limestone with painted reliefs above a dado of red granite.96 The back of the portico led to the causeway the base of which was entirely covered in basalt while its upper portions were decorated with numerous reliefs some showing the king as a sphinx trampling over his enemies.101 The causeway was roofed by limestone blocks painted in blue with golden stars.101 Arriving near the pyramid the causeway led into a columned courtyard preceded by storage rooms and succeeded by the mortuary temple itself which housed statues of the king and depictions of the royal family and Nyuserre in the presence of the gods.101 The wider pyramid complex was enclosed by a wall with two large rectangular structures on its northeast and southeast corners. Both Lehner and Verner see these as the precursor of the pylon characteristic of later Egyptian temples.102101 Beyond the main pyramid was a smaller one for the Ka of the king.101 Pyramid Lepsius XXIVedit Main article Lepsius XXIV Ruins of the pyramid Lepsius XXIV South of the pyramid of his mother Khentkaus II Nyuserre built a pyramid for a queen either a consort of himself or of his brother Neferefre.103 The pyramid is known today as Lepsius XXIV after its number in Karl Richard Lepsius pioneering list of pyramids.104 It originally reached about 27 m 89 ft high with a base of 
31.5  m 103 ft its core made of limestone and clay mortar organised in horizontal and accretion layers.105 Today the pyramid is heavily ruined its outer casing of fine white limestone long gone and it stands only 5 m 16 ft tall. While graffiti left by the builders indicate that the construction of this pyramid dates to the later part of Nyuserres reign and took place under the direction of vizier Ptahshepses105 the name of the queen for whom the pyramid was intended is lost.104 Reptynub has been cited as a likely candidate. In the burial chamber which is reached via a straight northsouth passageway the broken up mummy of a young woman was discovered. She stood around 160 cm 
5.2  ft tall and died between 21 and 23 years of age.106 It is unclear whether the mummy is that of the original owner of the pyramid or dates to a later period as the mummification method employed could suggest.105 Excavations of the burial chamber yielded fragments of a pink granite sarcophagus as well as pieces of large calcite canopic jars and smaller funerary equipment.105 On the eastern side of the pyramid the ruins of a small satellite pyramid as well as of a mortuary temple have been discovered. Both were heavily affected by stone robbing which started as early as the New Kingdom and reached a climax during the Saite 664525 BCE and Persian 525402 BCE periods making a modern reconstruction of the temple layout impossible.105 Lepsius XXVedit Main article Double Pyramid Ruins of Lepsius XXV in Abusir The ruins known today as Lepsius XXV constitute not one but two large adjacent tombs built as a single monument on the southeastern edge of the Abusir necropolis. The peculiar construction which Verner has called a double pyramid was known to ancient Egyptians as The Two are Vigilant.note 16 The pyramids both truncated had rectangular bases of 
27.7  m  
21.5  m 91 ft  71 ft for the eastern one and 
21.7  m  
15.7  m 71 ft  52 ft for the western one their walls reaching an inclination of about 78 degrees. This means that the construction resembled a pair of mastabas more than a couple of pyramids103 in fact so much so that Duan Magdolen proposed that Lepsius XXV is a mastaba.108 A further peculiarity of the structure is the lack of associated mortuary temple.103 Instead the eastern tomb boasts a small offering chapel built of undecorated white limestone and situated within the tomb superstructure. Its ceiling reached 5 m 16 ft high. Excavations revealed small pieces of papyrus inscribed with a list of offerings as well as fragments of an alabaster statue of a woman clothed in a simple robe. The burial chamber revealed scant remains of the female owner and a few pieces of funerary equipment.103 The western tomb was built subsequently to the eastern one and seems to have served to bury another woman. Builders graffiti uncovered during the Czech excavations demonstrate in all likelihood that the monument was built under Nyuserre its owners possibly amongst the last members of the broader royal family to be buried in Abusir the necropolis being abandoned by Nyuserres successor Menkauhor.103 Sun Templeedit Ludwig Borchardts reconstruction of the Shesepibre109 Red granite entrance portico bearing Nyuserres titulary likely from his sun temple Egyptian Museum Nyuserre was the penultimate Egyptian pharaoh to build a sun temple. In doing so he was following a tradition established by Userkaf that reflects the paramount importance of the cult of Ra during the Fifth Dynasty. Sun temples built during this period were meant to play for Ra the same role that the pyramid played for the king they were funerary temples for the sun god where his renewal and rejuvenation necessary to maintain the order of the world could take place. Cults performed in the temple were thus primarily concerned with Ras creator function as well as his role as father of the king. During his lifetime the king would appoint his closest officials to the running of the temple allowing them to benefit from the temples income and thus ensuring their loyalty. After the pharaohs death the sun temples income would be associated with the pyramid complex supporting Nyuserres funerary cult.110 Located in Abu Ghurob north of Abusir Nyuserres sun temple is the largest and best preserved of its kind4 leading some Egyptologists such as von Beckerath to see Nyuserres reign as the peak of the solar cult111 an assertion which according to Grimal is exaggerated.112 The temple was known as the Shesepibre by the Ancient Egyptiansnote 17 which has been variously translated as Joy of the heart of Re4 Res Favorite Place113 Delight of Ra114 or Place agreeable to Ra.99 Curiously114 Nyuserres sun temple was first built in mudbrick only later to be reconstructed entirely in stone.114 It is the only such structure to receive this treatmentnote 18112111 thanks to which much of the architectural elements and reliefs have survived to this day.112115 While the reason for this renewal remains unclear Lehner has proposed that it may be related to Nyuserres Sed festival or to some evolution in the ideology surrounding sun temples.114 Altar of the sun temple of Nyuserre The temple was entered from the eastern side following a long causeway which departed from a valley temple located closer to the Nile. This temple mostly served as a gateway to the upper temple and housed a pillared portico of mudbrick encased in yellow limestone.114 The upper temple comprised a large rectangular courtyard entered via five granite doorways located on its eastern side. An altar was located in the center of the courtyard which can still be seen today. It was constructed from five large blocks of alabaster one shaped like the hieroglyph for Ra and the others shaped like the glyph for hotep. They were arranged so as to read Ra Hotep that is May Ra be satisfied116 from the four cardinal points.113 The sign for Hotep also means offering or offering table in Ancient Egyptian so that the altar was literally an offering table to Ra.117 At the western end of the rectangular court was a giant obelisk a symbol of the sun god Ra. It was built on a pedestal with sloping sides and a square top like a truncated pyramid which was 20 m 66 ft high and was constructed of limestone and red granite around the base. The obelisk topping it was another 36 m 118 ft high117 built entirely of limestone.114 The temple was adorned with numerous fine reliefs depicting Nyuserres Sed festival as well as a chapel of seasons attached to the obelisk pedestal decorated with representations of human activities throughout the seasons.118114 Completion and restoration worksedit Pyramid complex of Neferirkareedit Main article Pyramid of Neferirkare The pyramid of Neferirkare in Abusir The pyramid of Neferirkare was planned to be significantly larger than that of Neferirkares Fifth Dynasty predecessors with a square base side of 105 m 344 ft and a height of 72 m 236 ft. Although well underway at the death of the pharaoh the pyramid was lacking its external limestone cladding and the accompanying mortuary temple still had to be built. Neferefre had begun covering the pyramid surface with limestone and had built the foundation of a stone temple on the pyramid eastern side Nyuserre completed their fathers pyramid complex119 though he did so more parsimoniously than his brother. He abandoned the task of covering the pyramid altogether and finished the mortuary temple with cheaper materials than were normally used for such buildings. Its walls were made of mudbricks rather than limestone and its floor was of beaten clay.120 The outer part of the temple was built to comprise a column portico and a pillared court all columns being made of wood rather than the usual granite.120 The temple and pyramid were also surrounded by a brick wall. Likely for reasons of economy the causeway leading to the mortuary temple at the foot of the pyramid was never built no satellite pyramid was added to the mortuary complex and the valley temple was left unfinished.121 Consequently the priest of the mortuary cult of Neferirkare lived on the temple premises in dwellings of mudbricks and rushes rather than in the pyramid town closer to the Nile valley.121 Pyramid of Neferefreedit Main article Pyramid of Neferefre The unfinished pyramid of Neferefre Construction works on the pyramid of Neferefre had just begun when Neferefre died unexpectedly in his early twenties. At the time of Nyuserres ascension to the throne only one step of the core of Neferefres pyramid had been completed. The substructures built in a large open pit at the center of the pyramid were possibly unfinished as well. Nyuserre hastily122 completed the pyramid by transforming it into a stylised primeval mound122 resembling a mastaba the walls of the core layer already in place were covered with limestone and the top was filled with clay and stones drawn from the local desert.123 The accompanying mortuary temple which then comprised only a small stone chapel possibly built by the ephemeral Shepseskare38 was finished by Nyuserre.96 Extending over the whole 65 m 213 ft length of the pyramid side the temple was built of mudbrick and comprised the earliest hypostyle hall of Ancient Egypt its roof supported by wooden columns. The hall housed a large wooden statue of the deceased king.96 Nyuserre also built storage rooms to the north of the hall and east of it the Sanctuary of the Knife where animals were ritually slaughtered. A column courtyard completed the temple entrance adorned with two stone columns and 24 wooden ones.96 Pyramid complex of Khentkaus IIedit In the foreground Khentkaus ruined mortuary temple Work on the pyramid and mortuary temple of Nyuserres mother Khentkaus II had begun during her husbands rule but was stopped in the tenth year of his reign48 at which point only the pyramid core was still uncased.124 After a delay of 12 years125 Nyuserre Ini restarted the building work and expended much effort126 in completing the majority of the construction.127128 The motivation for this might have been to legitimise his rule following the premature death of Neferefre and the possible challenge by Shepseskare.129 The pyramid is located in Abusir next to that of Neferikare Kakai who was Khentkaus husband and under whose reign the construction of Khentkauss complex had started.126 Once completed the pyramid stood 17 m 56 ft high with a side of 25 m 82 ft at the base and a slope of 52 degrees.48 Its sepulchral chamber likely housed a sarcophagus of red granite. Today the pyramid is a 4 m 13 ft high mound of rubble.125 The mortuary temple of the queen at the eastern foot of the pyramid125 was the object of successive completion works during Nyuserres reign the earliest one used stone while the latest used only mudbrick.126 Completely ruined today the temple seems to have been designed in imitation of the mortuary temples of kings128 incorporating for example a satellite pyramid130 and being aligned on an eastwest axis.48 The temple was administratively at least partially independent131 from the temple of Neferirkare Kakai with which it nonetheless shared some religious services132 and it continued to function until the end of the Sixth Dynasty some 300 years after Khentkaus lifetime.48 Valley Temple of Menkaureedit Main article Pyramid of Menkaure Archaeological excavations in 20122015 revealed that Nyuserre Ini undertook building works on the valley temple of Menkaure as witnessed by numerous seal impressions bearing his serekh discovered on the site.13314 These works ended a long period from the reign of Shepseskaf until his reign during which the Giza necropolis was not the object of royal attention.14 Beyond Menkaures valley temple Nyuserre apparently also took a wider interest in the administration of the pyramid town of Khafre and revived the cult of both Menkaure and queen Khentkaus I.134 According to Mark Lehner this queen who bore the same name as Nyuserres mother and like his mother bore two pharaohs provided Nyuserre with a genealogical link relating him to his Fourth Dynasty forebears.135 John Nolan believes that the mirroring position and names of both Khentkaus queens was emphasised so that Nyuserre could legimitise his rule after the troubled times surrounding Neferefres death.136 In the valley temple of Menkaure Nyuserre extended the eastern annex where he added two sets of alabaster columns133 rebuilt the main entrance and refurbished the limestone causeway leading from the valley temple to the high temple.137 There Mark Lehner suggested that Nyuserre expanded the inner part of the high temple138139 notably adding to it a square antechamber with a single central pillar.133 Sun Temple of Userkafedit Main article Sun temple of Userkaf Userkaf founder of the Fifth Dynasty was also the first pharaoh to build a temple to Ra in Abu Gurob. The temple was called Nekhenre by the Ancient Egyptian which means The Fortress of Ra and built in four phases by three pharaohs. Userkaf first constructed a rectangular enclosure with a mound in its center. Sahure140 or Neferirkare Kakai141 then transformed this mound into a granite obelisk on a pedestal adding two statue shrines near its base. The last two phases of construction were undertaken during Nyuserres reign. Nyuserre first added an inner enclosure of limestone in the preexisting court extended the outside enclosure and either completed or built entirely the valley temple. In the last construction phase Nyuserre encased the inner enclosure in mudbrick added an altar and five stone benches to the central court and built an annex to the temple.141 Temple of Satetedit Main article Temple of Satet A temple dedicated to the goddess Satet personification of the Nile floods had stood on the island of Elephantine to the south of Egypt since at least the late Predynastic Period around 3200 BCE. The temple was enlarged and renovated several times from the Early Dynastic Period onwards and was again rebuilt in the course of the Fifth Dynasty possibly during Nyuserres reign. A faience plaque bearing Nyuserres name was discovered in a deposit of votive offerings located under the floor of the sanctuary.142 Unfortunately this deposit does not represent the original context of the plaque which could have once adorned the walls of the temple or could equally have been deposed in a foundational offering made in anticipation of the temple reconstruction.142 Familyedit Glazed relief showing Khentkaus II enthroned Nprstek Museum Parents and siblingsedit The identity of the mother of Nyuserre is known with certainty it was queen Khentkaus II in whose mortuary temple a fragmentary relief showing her facing her son Nyuserre and his family has been uncovered.143144145 On this relief both Khentkaus and Nyuserre appear on the same scale.144 As a corollary Nyuserre was almost certainly a son of Neferirkare Kakai as Khentkaus II was Neferirkares queen.146 This relationship is also indicated by the location of Nyuserres pyramid in Abusir next to that of Neferirkare as well as his reuse for his own valley temple of materials from Neferikares unfinished constructions.147 At least one sibling of Nyuserre is known with nearcertainty Neferefre who was a son of Neferirkare and Khentkaus II was Nyuserres elder brother.148 Since the relation between Shepseskare and Nyuserre remains uncertain it is possible that the two were brothers too as suggested by Roth149 although the dominant hypothesis is that Shepseskare was a son of Sahure and hence Nyuserres uncle. Finally yet another brother150 possibly younger151 than Nyuserre has also been proposed Iryenre a prince Irypatnote 19 whose relationship is suggested by the fact that his funerary cult was associated with that of his mother both having taken place in the temple of Khentkaus II.153154 Consorts and daughtersedit Entrance of the pyramid Lepsius XXIV believed to belong to a consort of Nyuserre Nyuserre Ini seems to have had at least two wives as witnessed by two small pyramids located at the southern end of the pyramid field of Abusir.104 Known today under the names of Lepsius XXIV and Lepsius XXV given to them by Lepsius in his list of pyramids both monuments are heavily ruined and the names of their owners cannot be ascertained.104 One of these two queens might have been Reptynub155 the only known consort of Nyuserre. Her existence and relation to Nyuserre are attested by a fragmentary alabaster statuette1
56 note 20 of her discovered in the valley temple157 of Nyuserres pyramid complex.158 Pieces of relief from the tomb of vizier Ptahshepses give the titles of a queen and while her name is lost these titles are the same as those that Reptynub bore159 leading Egyptologists to propose that these refer to her.160158 Nyuserre and Reptynub likely had a daughter in the person of princess Khamerernebty14
84 note 21 as suggested by her title of Kings daughter as well as her marriage to the powerful vizier Ptahshepses.161162 This remains conjectural until direct evidence of this relationship can be discovered.159 In particular the only known connection between Reptynub and Khamerernebty are the reliefs from Ptahshepsess tomb the presence of which would seem natural163159 if Reptynub was Khamerernebtys mother.164 Hartwig Altenmller goes further and hypothesises that Nyuserre had two more daughters who he believes were buried close to Nyuserres pyramid.4 In 2012 the tomb of Sheretnebty an hitherto unknown daughter of Nyuserre was excavated in Abusir south by a team under the direction of Miroslav Brta. She was married to an important Egyptian official whose name is lost. According to Brta this type of marriage reflects the growing nepotism in the Egyptian elite and the progressive dilution of the kings power.165 Sonsedit Nyuserre Ini is known to have had at least one son his first born whose name is lost is represented on several166167 relief fragments from the high temple of his pyramid complex.158 Beyond the title of Irypat and eldest kings son he likely held two priestly titles lector priest168 and priest of Min.note 22169 Although the name of Nyuserres eldest son is lost Michel Baud observes that one relief fragment comprises a re possibly part of the princes name. If so then he would be distinct from Menkauhor Kaiu Nyuserres successor.171 The precise relationship between Nyuserre and Menkauhor remains uncertain but indirect evidence from the mastaba of Khentkaus III discovered in 2015 favors the hypothesis that Menkauhor was a son of Neferefre and thus a nephew of Nyuserre rather than his own son.172 Khentkaus is called kings wife and kings mother in inscriptions left by the tomb builders. Given the location of the mastaba close to the pyramid of Neferefre her husband was likely this pharaoh.173174 Since she was also the mother of a king and since Nyuserre was a brother to Neferefre the son in question is most probably the future Menkauhor Kaiu who would thus have succeeded his uncle.172 In any case the succession of Nyuserre seems to have gone smoothly. A seal bearing both Nyuserres and Menkauhors names has been uncovered in the mortuary complex of Nyuserres mother Khentkaus II.175176 A further seal is believed to have both Nyuserres and Djedkares names on it Djedkare Isesi being Nyuserres second successor.177176 Taken together these seals reveal that at the very least Menkauhor and Djedkare did not perceive Nyuserre as an antagonist.178179180 Legacyedit Statuette of Nyuserre Ini of uncertain provenance now in the Egyptian Museumnote 23 As pharaoh Nyuserre Ini benefited from a funerary cult established at his death. Under the umbrella of the term funerary cult are grouped various cultic activities of two different types. First there was an official cult taking place in the kings mortuary complex and which was provided for by agricultural domains established during Nyuserres reign. This cult was most active until the end of the Old Kingdom but lasted at least until the Twelfth Dynasty during the Middle Kingdom182 at which point is the latest known mention of a priest serving in Nyuserres funerary complex.183 In later times the official cult of Nyuserre was essentially reduced to a cult of the royal ancestor figure a limited version of the cult of the divine as Jaromir Malek writes184 manifested by the dedication of statues and the compilation of lists of kings to be honoured.185 In parallel to that official cult were the more private cults of pious individuals venerating Nyuserre as a kind of saint an intercessor between the believers and the gods.184 This popular cult which developed spontaneously perhaps because of the proximity of Nyuserres pyramid to Memphis184 referred to Nyuserre using his birth name Iny186 and likely consisted of invocations and offerings to statues of the king or in his mortuary temple.184 Therefore archaeological traces of this cult are difficult to discern187 yet Nyuserres special status is manifest in some religious formulae where his name is invoked as well as in the onomastics of individuals notably during the Middle Kingdom whose names included Iny such as Inhotep Inemsaf Inankhu and many more.188 Although the veneration of Nyuserre was originally a local phenomenon from Abusir Saqqara and their surroundings184 it may have ultimately reached even outside of Egypt proper in Sinai Byblos and Nubia where fragments of statues vessels and stelae bearing Nyuserres name have been discovered in cultic contexts.189 Old Kingdomedit During the Old Kingdom provisions for the official funerary cult of Nyuserre Ini were produced in agricultural estates set up during his reign.190 The names of some of these estates have been found inscribed on the walls of tombs in Saqqara or in Nyuserres mortuary temple190 such as The track of Ininote 24 and The offerings of Ini.note 25 Several wt domains of the king which comprise the land holdings193 of the mortuary temple of Nyuserre are known Hathor wishes that Nyuserre livesnote 26 Horus wishes that Nyuserre livesnote 27 Bastet wishes that Nyuserre livesnote 28 and Ptah desires Nyuserre to live.note 29 Several priests serving in the pyramid complex and sun temple of Nyuserre are known from their tombs until the end of the Sixth Dynasty showing that the official mortuary cult endured throughout the late Old Kingdom.187 Nyuserre furthermore received special attention from at least two of his successors during this period Djedkare Isesi either restored or completed his funerary templenote 30199 and Pepi II Neferkare erected a door jamb bearing an inscription mentioning both his first Sed festival and Nyuserre in the latters valley temple a close association meant to evidence the pretended association of the king with his forefather.1
99 note 31 First Intermediate Periodedit Head of king probably Nyuserre3 Nyuserre is one of the very few Old Kingdom kings for whom there is evidence that the funerary cult continued uninterrupted during the First Intermediate Periodnote 32 when the central authority of the pharaohs had broken down and the Egyptian state was in turmoil.186201 The tombs of two priests Heryshefhotep I and II who lived during this periodnote 33 mention their roles and duties in the funerary establishment of Nyuserre witnessing to the continuing existence of the official mortuary cult.205 Nyuserres effective deification and popular veneration flourished in parallel to the official cult throughout the period as revealed for example by inscriptions in the tomb of an individual named Ipi who desires to be honoured before Inynote 34 a terminology in which Nyuserre plays a role normally reserved to the gods.206 Similar qualifications denoting Nyuserres status are found in tombs dating to the subsequent early Middle Kingdom such as the mummy chest of an individual named Inhotep on which he says he is to be honoured before Osiris lord of life and Iny lord of reverence.note 35 Middle Kingdomedit The Middle Kingdom saw the decline of the official cult of Nyuserre. Evidence from this period come from works undertaken in the Karnak temple by Senusret I who dedicated a number of statues of Old Kingdom kings185 including at least one of Nyuserrenote 36 to a cult of Amun and of the royal ancestors.209 At the same time the 
12 th Dynasty saw the widespread dismantling of many Old Kingdom funerary temples for their materials which were notably reused in the pyramid complexes of Amenemhat I and Senusret I.184 These events are contemporaneous with the life of the last priest serving the official cult of Nyuserre a certain Inhotep.205 Both of these facts hint at a lapse of royal interest in the statesponsored funerary cults of Old Kingdom rulers.184 New Kingdomedit Section of the Karnak list of kings to be honoured by Thutmosis III. Nyuserre is the fourth seated king of the top row. The popular veneration of Nyuserre during earlier times continued to influence the cults performed during the New Kingdom. This is best exemplified by the Karnak king list composed during the reign of Thutmosis III with the purpose of honouring a selection of royal ancestors and which includes the cartouche showing Iny for Nyuserre. This choice is unusual as cartouches normally include the kings praenomen rather than a birth name Iny being likely chosen here because it was under this name that Nyuserre was venerated and had become deified.33 Later during the Ramesside period statues of Old Kingdom pharaohs including one of Nyuserre Ini were placed in a cachette a hiding place in the temple of Ptah in Memphis suggesting their continued use for cultic purposes until that point.210 Concurrently with these activities extensive restoration works in Abusir and Saqqara were undertaken during the reign of Ramses II under the direction of prince Khaemweset. The sun temple of Nyuserre was among the monuments benefiting from these works.211 Third Intermediate Periodedit During the late Third Intermediate Period Old Kingdom mortuary temples enjoyed a revival of interest due primarily to the archaizing style favoured by the kings of the Twentyfifth Dynasty of Egypt c. 760656 BCE.212 In particular Taharqa fl. c. 690664 BCE had reliefs from the temples of Sahure Nyuserre and Pepi II reproduced in the temple of Amun of GemAten in Karnak during his restoration works there.212 Notes citations and sourcesedit Explanatory notesedit  Proposed dates for Nyuserres reign 24742444 BCE123 24702444 BCE4 24652435 BCE5 24532422 BCE6 24532420 BCE7 24452421 BCE8910 24452414 BCE11 24202389 BCE12 24022374 BCE1314 23982388 BCE.15 In a 1978 work the Egyptologist William C. Hayes credited Nyuserre with 302 years of reign starting c. 2500 BCE.16  The only date known reliably in relation with Nyuserre Ini comes from radiocarbon dating of a piece of wood discovered in the mastaba of Ptahshepses a vizier and son in law of Nyuserre. The wood was dated to 24652333 BCE.1718  Numerous artefacts and architectural elements either bearing Nyuserres nomen prenomen or serekh or simply contemporary with his reign have been unearthed. These are now scattered throughout the world in many museums including the Boston Museum of Fine Arts24 Brooklyn Museum25 Los Angeles County Museum of Art3 Metropolitan Museum of Art26 Petrie Museum2728 the Egyptian Museum of Cairo and many more.  Neferefre was the eldest son of Neferirkare with queen Khentkaus II4314 as shown by a relief on limestone slab depicting Neferirkare and his wife Khentkaus with the kings eldest son Ranefer the future pharaoh Neferefre.43 At the same time Nyuserre Ini undertook numerous construction works in the mortuary temple of Khentkaus II who bore the title of Mother of Two Kings of Upper and Lower Egypt indicating that two of her sons ascended the throne. See below for a detailed discussion.  That is Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini.  Verner proposes that he received the title upon marrying Nyuserres daughter.50  During the Old Kingdom Ancient Egyptians did not have a system of absolute dating as we do today rather they counted years from the beginning of a kings reign and gave them names relating to important events that occurred or would occur during this year. The most important such event was the cattle count and many documents and inscriptions thus mentions the year of the Xth cattle count under king Y. In the case of Nyuserre the latest such event attested in a document contemporaneous with his reign is the 
8 th cattle count that is at most Nyuserres 
16 th year on the throne.55  Between his 1985 book on the Egyptian administration and his 2005 book on Egyptian texts of the Old Kingdom Nigel Strudwick has changed his opinion on Nyuserres reign length and now credits him with 31 years on the throne.11  Ryholt writes Nyuserres reign is damaged. There is a distinct trace of a 10 20 or 30 followed by a stroke after which the papyrus breaks off. Accordingly the possibilities are 1114 2124 and 3134 years for Nyuserre and not just 24 years as is conventionally assumed.34  Verner writes that such scenes are part of a standard decoration program for the funerary complex of the king Beautiful reliefs with the scenes of the sedfestival from this sun temple are occasionally considered as indirect evidence of a long reign for this king. Generally the historical authenticity ... of such reliefs is doubted since the sedfestival scenes very probably belonged in the Old Kingdom to the standard Bildprogram of the royal funerary monuments.17  Joyce Tyldesley instead sees the reign of Djedkare Isesi as the very beginning of the decline in the importance of the king67 given the decentralisation stemming from his reforms. Yet for Nigel Strudwick and Klaus Baer these reforms were precisely undertaken as a reaction to the rapid growth of the central administration68 which had amassed too much political or economic power69 in the eyes of the king.70  Catalogue number Cairo JE 385
