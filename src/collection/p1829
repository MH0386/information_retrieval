During the reign of Nectanebo II Egyptian artists developed a specific style that left a distinctive mark on the reliefs of the Ptolemaic Kingdom.6 Like his indirect predecessor Nectanebo I Nectanebo II showed enthusiasm for many of the cults of the gods within ancient Egyptian religion and more than a hundred Egyptian sites bear evidence of his attention.7 For several years Nectanebo II was successful in keeping Egypt safe from the Achaemenid Empire.8 However he was betrayed by his former servant Mentor of Rhodes and ultimately defeated. The Persians occupied Memphis and then seized the rest of Egypt incorporating the country into the Achaemenid Empire under Artaxerxes III. Nectanebo fled south.9 His subsequent fate is unknown. Nameedit Nectanebo is derived from the Greek form of his name Nectanebos  or  in later sources. His Egyptian name was Ntrbt10 which means victorious is Horus of Hebyt.11 Although convention in English assigns identical names to him and his grandfather Nectanebo I the latter was in fact called Nectanebis .12 Medieval Arab authors referred to him as Naqatanibas Arabic .13 Rise to poweredit Isis and Nectanebo II In 525 BC Egypt was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire. Because of internal struggles for the Persian imperial succession Egypt managed to regain independence in 404 BC. In 389 BC Pharaoh Hakor negotiated a treaty with Athens and for three years from 385 to 383 BC managed to withstand Persian aggression.14 However following the conclusion of the Peace of Antalcidas in 387 BC between the Achaemenids and the Greek citystates Egypt and Cyprus became the only obstacles to Persian hegemony in the Mediterranean. At the beginning of 360 BC Nectanebos predecessor Teos started preparations for war against intruders. In the same year the Egyptian army set off traveling along the coast by land and sea. Nectanebo II accompanied his uncle Teos in that campaign and was in charge of the machimoi.15 In an attempt to quickly raise finances for the war Teos imposed taxes on Egyptians and seized temple property.16 Egyptians particularly the priests resented these measures but supported Nectanebo II. Teos asked Spartan military leader Agesilaus and Athenian general Chabrias to support him.17 Agesilaus however said he was sent to aid Egypt and not to wage war against it.17 Chabrias returned home with his mercenaries.17 Teos decided to flee to the Achaemenid court where he ultimately died of natural causes. Nectanebo contended with an unnamed pretender to the throne from the town of Mendes who proclaimed himself pharaoh.17 The revolt was probably led by one of the descendants of Nepherites I whose family had ruled the town before.18 The claimant sent messengers to Agesilaus in an attempt to persuade Agesilaus to his side.17 Agesilaus remained loyal to Nectanebo fearing to become a turncoat. At one of the towns in the Nile Delta the troops of Nectanebo and Agesilaus were besieged by the usurper who had gained many sympathisers. Despite the enemys numerical superiority Nectanebo and Agesilaus were victorious and the revolt was put down in the fall of 360 BC.19 Reignedit Egyptian gold stater of Nectanebo II.

He began his reign by officiating over the funeral of an Apis bull in Memphis. There Nectanebo added a relief decoration to the eastern and western temples of Apis.22 Among notable sanctuaries erected under Nectanebo II are a temple of Khnum in Abu and a temple of Amun at Sekhtam. He also dedicated a diorite naos to AnhurShu a fragment of it was found in the temples of Tjebnutjer.6 Nectanebo II was responsible for the increasing popularity of the Buchis cult.19 Under Nectanebo II a decree forbidding stone quarrying in the socalled Mysterious Mountains in Abydos was issued.23 Foreign affairs under Nectanebo II were thwarted by repeated Achaemenid attempts to reoccupy Egypt. Before the accession of Nectanebo II to the throne the Persians attempted to reclaim Egypt in 385 383 and 373 BC. Nectanebo used the peace to build up a new army and employed Greek mercenaries which was a common practice at the time. In about 351 BC the Achaemenid Empire embarked on a new attempt to reclaim Egypt. After a year of fighting Nectanebo and his allied generals Diophantus of Athens ca and Lamius of Sparta managed to defeat the Achaemenids. Having scored a resounding victory Nectanebo II was acclaimed Nectanebo the divine falcon by his people and cults were set up in his name.24 Ushabti of Nectanebo II Egyptian faience. Museo Egizio Turin In 34544 BC Nectanebo supported the Phoenician rebellion against the Achaemenid Empire led by the king of Sidon Tennes25 and dispatched military aid in the form of 4000 Greek mercenaries led by Mentor of Rhodes.26 However having heard of the approach of the forces of Artaxerxes III Mentor opened communication with the Persians in collusion with Tennes.26 At the end of 344 BC ambassadors of Artaxerxes III arrived in Greece asking for the Greeks participation in a campaign against Egypt.27 Athens and Sparta treated the ambassadors with courtesy but refrained from committing to an alliance against Egypt.27 Other cities however decided to support the Persians Thebes sent 1000 hoplites and Argos 30
00.2 7 In the winter of 343 BC Artaxerxes set off for Egypt. The Egyptian army headed by Nectanebo consisted of 60000 Egyptians 20000 Libu and as many Greek mercenaries.28 In addition Nectanebo had a number of flatbottomed boats intended to prevent an enemy from entering the Nile mouths.29 The vulnerable points along his Mediterranean sea border and east boundary were protected by strongholds fortifications and entrenched camps.29 Persian forces were strengthened by Mentor and his men well acquainted with the eastern border of Egypt and by 6000 Ionians.26 Nectanebo II was ultimately defeated and in the summer of 342 BC Artaxerxes entered Memphis30 and installed a satrap.31 Nectanebo fled to Upper Egypt and finally to Nubia where he was granted asylum. He however preserved a degree of power there for some time. With the help of Khabash Nectanebo made a vain attempt to regain the throne.32 Black siltstone obelisk of Pharaoh Nectanebo II. According to the vertical inscriptions he set up this obelisk at the doorway of the sanctuary of Thoth the TwiceGreat Lord of Hermopolis. Today it is located in the British Museum London. Archaeological evidenceedit Building campaignsedit Though placed in an unfortunate period of Egyptian history and with his legacy perhaps marred by being the last pharaoh to rule an autonomous Egypt Nectanebo was an extensive builder likely on a scale that would equal many kings of the glory days of the New Kingdom.33 References to either Nectanebo II or his grandfather have been found almost ubiquitously at the premier religious centres and the piety of the two kings matched those of the great kings of the past attested to by the numerous monuments across Egypt bearing their names.22 Nectanebo II specifically built and improved temples across the country and he donated extensively to the priesthoods of the plethora of sites which he donated to. Nectanebos name has been found at Heliopolis Athribis and Bubastis in the Nile Delta among other places but he built most extensively at Sebennytos34 including the modern site of Behbeit El Hagar. The reliefs of the temples at Sebennytos would leave a distinct mark on the art of the later Ptolemaic Kingdom. The religious focus of his building campaigns however may not be solely due to sheer piety because Nectanebo was an usurper he likely sought to legitimise his rule over Egypt religiously.33 Portraitsedit The greywacke statue of Horus protecting Nectanebo II Except for the smallscale greywacke statue in the Metropolitan Museum of Art which shows Nectanebo II standing before the image of Horus no other annotated portraits of Nectanebo II are known.35 In the greywacke statue Nectanebo II is shown in a nemes and uraeus. His bent arm with the sword stands for the hieroglyph nakht the falcon represents Horus while the hieroglyph in Nectanebos right hand stands for heb.36 Other portraits attributed to Nectanebo II all featuring the khepresh include a quartzite head in the museum of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology a basalt head in Alexandria a granite head acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts Boston and a damaged quartzite head.35 Legacyedit Sarcophagusedit Sarcophagus of Nectanebo II taken by Napoleon at Alexandria and soon turned over to the British army In 1798 Napoleon captured the Egyptian city of Alexandria.37 Soon after following the Battle of Alexandria in 1801 Napoleons forces surrendered to the British and conditionally turned over antiquities they had gathered from the ancient city. Notably among these was the Rosetta Stone as well as a seven ton sarcophagus covered in hieroglyphics. Soon after the British secured these they were approached by locals who believed that this was the tomb of Alexander the Great.38 Thereafter the sarcophagus was taken to London where it still resides at the British Museum.39 For a time the tomb was believed to have belonged to Alexander. However after the translation of the Rosetta Stone the writings on the sarcophagus were deciphered and it became clear the tomb was not fashioned for him. The hieroglyphics on the tomb were sections from the Book of What is in the Underworld and contained the cartouche of Nectanebo II.38 The tomb was likely created for Nectanebo before going unused as he was overthrown and fled to Nubia.40 Sarcophagus of Nectanabo II. Seen at the bottom are the holes drilled for draining water. It has been argued that the sarcophagus did indeed house the remains of Alexander the Great. Alexander the Greats body was temporarily entombed in Memphis following his death and Saqqara is a suspected location of his temporary Memphite tomb. Nectanebo had erected a temple there where he may have intended to be laid to rest. It is possible the tomb was vacant in Memphis at the same time Alexanders body was placed there. When Alexanders remains were moved to Alexandria it may have been along with the sarcophagus.38 At the Attarine Mosque where it was found by Napoleons men holes had been drilled in the sarcophagus. It had been used as a ritual bath when Alexandria was under Islamic rule.39 Nectanebo and the Alexander Romanceedit Main article Alexander romance Papyrus of the Dream of Nectanebo c. 160150 BC Natanabo from Sola Busca Tarot Northern Italy c. 1491 Pinacoteca di Brera Milan There is an apocryphal tale appearing in the pseudohistorical Alexander romance that details another end for the last native pharaoh. Soon after Alexander the Greats godhood was confirmed by the Libyan Sibyl of Zeus Ammon at the Siwa Oasis a rumor was begun that Nectanebo II following defeat in his last battle did not travel to Nubia but instead to the court of Philip II of Macedon in the guise of an Egyptian magician. There while Philip was away on campaign Nectanebo convinced Philips wife Olympias that Amun was to come to her and that they would father a son. Nectanebo disguising himself as Amun slept with Olympias and from this event came Alexander.41 This myth would hold strong appeal for the Egyptians who desired continuity and harbored a strong dislike for foreign rule. In art of this event Nectanebo is usually depicted as having dragonlike features for example in the Speculum Historiale.42 In the early Ptolemaic tale of Nectanebo and Petesis43 preserved only in a Greek fragment from the Serapeum of Saqqara the pharaoh has a prophetic dream of Isis in which the god Onuris is angry with him because of his unfinished temple in Sebennytos. Nectanebo calls in the best sculptor of the realm Petesis to finish the job but he bungles his assignment when he gets drunk and chases a beautiful girl instead. The narrative ends abruptly here but this is probably the preface to the fall of Egypt.44 AlBirunis A History of India reproduces the story.45 Alexander unhorsing Porrus the King of India BL Royal MS B xx c. 1420 The legend of Nectanebo or Nectanebus or Natanabo as reported in some versions of the Alexander Romance left a profound mark on European culture up to the Renaissance and beyond. It is no coincidence that this character is included in the Sola Busca tarot with the name Natanabo together with other important actors of the same legend Alexander Philip of Macedon Olympias and Ammon.46 An alchemical interpretation of this character was provided by the Italian scholar Sofia Di Vincenzo in a study on the Sola Busca Tarot where she explains that Natanabo represents a celestial messenger who came to earth with a gift the helmet which is a symbol of invulnerability and both physical and mental potency.47 Referencesedit  Lloyd 1994 p. 358.
