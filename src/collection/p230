The museum contains 80000 objects making it one of the worlds largest collections of Egyptian and Sudanese material.1 It is designated under the Arts Council England Designation Scheme as being of national and international importance.2 Historyedit Upper part of a statuette of an Egyptian woman and her husband. 
18 th Dynasty. From the Amelia Edwards Collection now housed in the Petrie Museum The museum was established as a teaching resource for the Department of Egyptian Archaeology and Philology at University College at the same time as the department was established in 18
92.3  The initial collection was donated by the writer Amelia Edwards.45 The first Edwards Professor William Matthew Flinders Petrie conducted many important excavations and in 1913 he sold his collections of Egyptian antiquities to University College creating the Flinders Petrie Collection of Egyptian Antiquities and transforming the museum into one of the leading collections outside Egypt. The collection was first put on display in June 19
15.6  Petrie excavated dozens of major sites in the course of his career including the Roman Period cemeteries at Hawara7 famous for the beautiful mummy portraits in classical Roman style89 Amarna the city of king Akhenaten10 and the first true pyramid at Meydum where he uncovered some of the earliest evidence for mummification.11 The collection and library were arranged in galleries within the main building at the university and a guidebook was published in 1915. Initially the collections visitors were students and academics it was not then open to the general public. Petrie retired from University College London UCL in 193312 though his successors continued to add to the collections excavating in other parts of Egypt and Sudan. During the Second World War 19391945 the collection was packed up and moved out of London for safekeeping. In the early 19
50 s it was moved into a former stable where it remains adjacent to the DMS Watson science library of UCL. Current descriptionedit Fragments and slabs of stelae. Inscriptions Aisle The museum is at Malet Place near Gower Street and the University College London science library. Admission is free.13 The museum has an exhibitions and events programme for adults and families.14 There is a Friends of the Petrie Museum charity that supports the museum.15 Organisation and collectionsedit Display case at previous entrance to the Petrie prior to refurbishment with figurines and statuettes The museum is split into three galleries. The main gallery housed above the old stables contains many of the museums small domestic artefacts mummy portraits and cases and the Inscriptions Aisle. The Inscriptions Aisle displays tablets including Pyramid Texts written in hieroglyphics hieratic Greek and Arabic and organised according to material type. Another gallery the pottery gallery contains many cabinets of pottery clothing jewellery and shabti figures arranged chronologically. A new entrance gallery was refurbished in 201916 which provides an insight into the history of the museum its collections and notable figures. The entire collection has been digitised and the catalogue can be browsed and consulted online.17 Significant holdingsedit Limestone head of a king its provenance is unknown and has no inscriptions. Thought by Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology London to be Narmer on the basis of the similarity according to Petrie18 to the head of Narmer on the Narmer Palette. This has not been generally accepted. According to Trope Quirke  Lacovara19 the suggestion that it is Narmer is unlikely. Alternatively they suggest the Fourth Dynasty king Khufu. Stevenson20 also identifies it as Khufu. Charron21 identifies it as a king of the Thinite Period the first two dynasties but does not believe it can be assigned to any particular king. Wilkinson22 describes it as probably Second Dynasty. The museum contains over 80000 objects23 as has been designated as a collection of national and international importance by the Arts Council England.2 There are significant holdings of Egyptian costume including a piece of Egyptian linen from around 5000 BC one of the earliest known24 and the Tarkhan dress from the fourth millennium BC the worlds oldest known woven garment as of 20

In 2014 Bloomsbury Press published Archaeology of Race which explores the application of racial theory to interpret the past in Britain during the late Victorian and Edwardian period.32 The book written by Debbie Chalice specifically focuses on how Flinders Petrie applied the ideas of Francis Galton on inheritance and race to the discipline of archaeology.
