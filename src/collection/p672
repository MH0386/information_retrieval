30.9 3444 Type Settlement Heracleopolis Magna Greek    Megl Heraklous plis Heracleopolis  Heraklepolis or Herakleoupolis 1 is the Roman name of the capital of the 
20 th nome of ancient Upper Egypt known in Ancient Egyptian as nn nswt. The site is located approximately 15 km 
9.3  mi west of the modern city of Beni Suef in the Beni Suef Governorate of Egypt.2 Nameedit wt nn nswt345 in hieroglyphs In Ancient Egypt Heracleopolis Magna was called nn nswt meaning Child of the King appearing as hnn nswt or hwt nn nswt also transcribed HenenNesut or HutNenNesut. This later developed into Coptic  or  hnes which was borrowed into early Egyptian Arabic  Ahns. The site is now known as Ihnasiyyah Umm alKimam Ihnasiyyah Mother of the Shards and as Ihnasiyyah alMadinah The City of Ihnasiyyah.2 The Greek name meant City of Heracles with the epithet great being added to distinguish it from other towns with that name. The Greek form became more common during the Ptolemaic Kingdom which came to power after the death of Alexander the Great. The Roman Empire used a Latinised form of the Greek name.6 Some Egyptologists and Biblical scholars connect the biblical city of Hanes Hebrew  ns mentioned in Isaiah 304 with Heracleopolis Magna.3457 Historyedit Early Dynastic Periodedit The date of the earliest settlements on the site of Herakleopolis is not known but an entry on the Palermo Stone reporting king Dens visit to the sacred lake of Heryshef at Nenjneswt the ancient name of the city suggests that it was already in existence by the mid First Dynasty c. 2970 BC.89 First Intermediate Period 21812055 BCedit Partial view of the basrelief from the north wall of a funerary chapel containing the tombs of district governor NeferkhauNfrkhaU and a woman named SatBahetep probably his wifeSat Bahtp dated between 
9 th and 
11 th Dynasties. It shows a funerary foodoffering ritual for SatBahetepss ka between 2160 and 1990 BC. Herakleopolis first came to prominence and reached its apogee of power during the First Intermediate Period between 2181 and 2055 BC.10 Eventually after the collapse of the Old Kingdom Egypt was divided into Upper and Lower Egypt. Herakleopolis became the principal city of Lower Egypt and was able to exercise its control over much of the region.2 Herakleopolis exerted such great control over Lower Egypt during this time that Egyptologists and Egyptian archaeologists sometimes refer to the period between the 
9 th and 
10 th Dynasties 21602025 BC as the Herakleopolitan Period.2 During this period Herakleopolis often found itself in conflict with the de facto capital of Upper Egypt ancient Thebes.10 Middle Kingdom 20551650 BCedit Between the latter part of the First Intermediate Period and the early Middle Kingdom the city became the religious center of the cult of Heryshaf and the Temple of Heryshaf was constructed.10 Heracleopolis Magna and its dynasty was defeated by Mentuhotep II in c. 20552004 BC which ushered in the Middle Kingdom period.11 Third Intermediate Period 1069664 BCedit By the time of the Third Intermediate Period 1069664 BC Herakleopolis again rose in importance. There were many renovations and new constructions of the temple and mortuary centers that existed in the city and it again became an important religious and political center.10 Ptolemaic Egypt 32230 BCedit By the Ptolemaic Kingdom 33230 BC Herakleopolis was still an important religious and cultural center in Egypt. The Greek rulers of this period in an attempt to find connections and comparisons between their own gods and the gods of the land that they were now ruling associated Haryshef with Heracles in the interpretatio graeca thus the name often used by modern scholars for Herakleopolis.10 Roman Egypt 30 BC390 ADedit The site of Herakleopolis was occupied even into Roman times. Near the Necropolis of Sedmet elGebel houses dating to this period were found10 which in and of itself implies a continued occupation of the area.

19 th Dynasty. Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology London Wikimedia Commons has media related to Herakleopolis Magna. The first person to undertake an extensive excavation at Herakleopolis was the Swiss Egyptologist Edouard Naville. After excavating what he believed to be the entirety of the Temple of Heryshef Naville came to the conclusion that he had found all that Herakleopolis had to offer.6 His friend Sir Flinders Petrie on the other hand ...in 1879 suspected that the region already cleared was only a part of the temple6 and thus Herakleopolis or Ehnasya as he called it a name harking back to the sites period of Roman occupation had much left to be unearthed. Petrie discovered a great deal that Naville had not believed existed. He completed the excavation of the temple of Heryshef and attempted to find other remains in an area around the temple. In so doing he succeeded in discovering such previously unknown features. such as a houses remains from the Roman period of occupation.6 He also identified another temple that he attributed to the 
19 th Dynasty as well as the aforementioned additions to the Temple of Heryshef associated with Ramesses the Great.6 Other than archaeological features the artefacts found by Petrie during his excavation are numerous and span the entire chronological range of settlement. Relating specifically to artefacts found from the end of the First Intermediate Period and the beginning of the Middle Kingdom Petrie uncovered numerous pot sherds he associated with the 
11 th Dynasty.6 From the later Roman periods Petrie found numerous objects associated with many of the mortuary sites that he unearthed including iron tools pottery and icons.6 Recent excavationsedit While other excavations are not numerous and are naturally overshadowed by that of Flinders Petrie and his famous expedition there have been several more recent excavations that have also increased knowledge of the site. During the 19
80 s a Spanish team conducted excavations and uncovered such artefacts as a libation altar and a pair of decorated eyes presumably from a statue all attributed to a temple dated to the Third Intermediate Period.10 A Spanish team also conducted excavations as recently as 2008 under the direction of Mara del Carmen PrezDie of the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid Spain. Their efforts revealed a previously unknown tomb with several false doors dating to the First Intermediate Period as well as funeral offerings all of which had not been vandalized.12 Other finds include the funeral chapel of senior official Neferjau and his wife SatBahetep13 and the remains of tomb H.1 belonging to a late
11 th Dynasty officier named Khety.14 Referencesedit  a b Stephanus of Byzantium Ethnica H3
