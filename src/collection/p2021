Named after its capital city Palmyra it encompassed the Roman provinces of Syria Palaestina Arabia Petraea and Egypt as well as large parts of Asia Minor. The Palmyrene Empire was ruled by Queen Zenobia officially as regent for her son Vaballathus who inherited the throne in 267 at age ten. In 270 Zenobia rapidly conquered most of the Roman east attempting to maintain relations with Rome as a legitimate power. In 271 she claimed the imperial title for both herself and her son fighting a short war with the Roman emperor Aurelian who conquered Palmyra and captured Zenobia. A year later the Palmyrenes rebelled which led Aurelian to raze Palmyra. Despite its brief existence the Palmyrene Empire is remembered for having been ruled by one of the most ambitious and powerful women in antiquity. It is also hailed in Syria where it plays an important role as an icon in Syrian nationalism. Backgroundedit Further information Crisis of the Third Century Following the murder of Roman emperor Alexander Severus in 2356 general after general squabbled over control of the empire7 the frontiers were neglected and subjected to frequent raids by Carpians Goths and Alemanni89 in addition to outright attacks from the aggressive Sassanids in the east.10 Finally Shapur I of Persia inflicted a disastrous defeat upon the Romans at the Battle of Edessa in 26011 capturing the Roman emperor Valerian and soon Quietus and Macrianus rebelled against Valerians son Gallienus and usurped the imperial power in Syria.12 The Palmyrene leader Odaenathus was declared king13 and remained nominally loyal to Gallienus forming an army of Palmyrenes and Syrian peasants to attack Shapur.note 211 In 260 Odaenathus won a decisive victory over Shapur in a battle near the Euphrates.12 Next Odaenathus defeated the usurpers in 26112 and spent the remainder of his reign fighting the Persians.151617 Odaenathus received the title Governor of the East12 and ruled Syria as the imperial representative18 and declared himself King of Kings.note 321 Odaenathus was assassinated along with his son Hairan in 26712 according to Joannes Zonaras and the Historia Augusta he was killed by his cousin whose name is given by the latter source as Maeonius.22 The Historia Augusta also claims that Maeonius was proclaimed emperor for a very brief period before being executed by the soldiers.222324 No inscriptions or other evidence exist for Maeonius reign and he was probably killed immediately after assassinating Odaenathus.2526 Odaenathus was succeeded by his minor son the tenyearold Vaballathus27 under the regency of Zenobia.2728 Vaballathus was kept in the shadow while his mother assumed actual rule and consolidated her power.27 The queen was careful not to provoke Rome and took for herself and her son the titles that her husband had while working on guaranteeing the safety of the borders with Persia and pacifying the dangerous Tanukhid tribes in Hauran.27 Establishmentedit See also Sack of Bostra and Palmyrene invasion of Egypt Vaballathus right as king on the obverse of an Antoninianus.

Zenobia started an expedition against the Tanukhids in the spring of 270 during the reign of emperor Claudius Gothicus29 aided by her generals Septimius Zabbai a general of the army and Septimius Zabdas the chief general of the army.30 Zabdas sacked Bosra killed the Roman governor and marched south securing Roman Arabia.2931 According to the Persian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh Zenobia herself attacked Dumat AlJandal but could not conquer its castle.32 However Ibn Khordadbeh is confusing Zenobia with alZabb a semilegendary Arab queen whose story is often confused with Zenobias story.33343536 In October of 27037 a Palmyrene army of 70000 invaded Egypt3839 and declared Zenobia queen of Egypt.40 The Roman general Tenagino Probus was able to regain Alexandria in November but was defeated and escaped to the fortress of Babylon where he was besieged and committed suicide after being captured by Zabdas who continued his march south and secured Egypt.41 Afterward in 271 Zabbai started the operations in Asia Minor and was joined by Zabdas in the spring of that year.42 The Palmyrenes subdued Galatia42 and occupied Ancyra marking the greatest extent of the Palmyrene expansion.43 However the attempts to conquer Chalcedon were unsuccessful.42 The Palmyrene conquests were done under the protective show of subordination to Rome.44 Zenobia issued coinage in the name of Claudius successor Aurelian with Vaballathus depicted as kingnote 4 while the emperor allowed the Palmyrene coinage and conferred the Palmyrene royal titles.45 However toward the end of 271 Vaballathus took the title of Augustus along with his mother.44 Reconquest by Romeedit Vaballathus as Augustus on the obverse of an Antoninianus.

In 272 Aurelian crossed the Bosphorus and advanced quickly through Anatolia.46 According to one account Marcus Aurelius Probus regained Egypt from Palmyranote 547 while the emperor continued his march and reached Tyana.48 The fall of Tyana lent itself to a legend Aurelian to that point had destroyed every city that resisted him but he spared Tyana after having a vision of the great philosopher Apollonius of Tyana whom he respected greatly in a dream.49 Apollonius implored him stating Aurelian if you desire to rule abstain from the blood of the innocent Aurelian if you will conquer be merciful.50 Whatever the reason for his clemency Aurelians sparing of Tyana paid off many more cities submitted to him upon seeing that the emperor would not exact revenge upon them.49 Entering Issus and heading to Antioch Aurelian defeated Zenobia in the Battle of Immae.51 Zenobia retreated to Antioch then fled to Emesa while Aurelian advanced and took the former.52 After regrouping the Romans first destroyed a Palmyrene garrison stationed at the fort of Daphnenote 654 and headed south to Apamea55 then continued to Emesa and defeated Zenobia again at the Battle of Emesa forcing her to evacuate to the capital.56 Aurelian marched through the desert and was harassed by Bedouins loyal to Palmyra but as soon as he arrived at the city gates he negotiated with the Bedouins who betrayed Palmyra and supplied the Roman army with water and food.57 Aurelian besieged Palmyra in the summer of 27258 and tried to negotiate with Zenobia on the condition that she surrender herself in person to him to which she answered with refusal.43 The Romans tried to breach the city defenses several times but were repelled59 however as the situation deteriorated Zenobia left the city and headed east to ask the Persians for help.60 The Romans followed the empress captured her near the Euphrates and brought her back to the emperor. Soon after the Palmyrene citizens asked for peace60 and the city capitulated.5861 Aftermathedit Aurelian personification of Sol defeats the Palmyrene Empire and celebrates ORIENS AVG the Augustus Rising Sun. Aurelian spared the city and stationed a garrison of 600 archers led by a certain Sandarion as a peacekeeping force.62 The defenses were destroyed and most of the military equipment was confiscated.63 Zenobia and her council were taken to Emesa and put on trial. Most of the highranking Palmyrene officials were executed64 while Zenobias and Vaballathuss fates are uncertain.65 In 273 Palmyra rebelled under the leadership of a citizen named Septimius Apsaios66 and contacted the Roman prefect of Mesopotamia Marcellinus offering to help him usurp the imperial power.66 Marcellinus delayed the negotiations and sent word to the Roman emperor66 while the rebels lost their patience and declared a relative of Zenobia named Antiochus as Augustus.67 Aurelian marched against Palmyra and was helped by a Palmyrene faction from inside the city headed by a man with a senatorial rank named Septimius Haddudan.6869 Aurelian spared Antiochus69 but razed Palmyra.70 The most valuable monuments were taken by the emperor to decorate his Temple of Sol61 while buildings were smashed people were clubbed and cudgeled and Palmyras holiest temple pillaged.61 Evaluation and legacyedit The ultimate motive behind the revolt is debated when dealing with the rise of Palmyra and the rebellion of Zenobia historians most often interpreted the ascendancy as an indication of cultural ethnic or social factors.71 Andreas Alfldi viewed the rebellion as a completely native ethnic opposition against Rome.71 Irfan Shahd considered Zenobias revolt a panArab movement that was a forerunner of the Arab expansion of the Caliphates71 an opinion shared by Franz Altheim71 and an almost universal view amongst Arab and Syrian scholars such as Philip Khuri Hitti.7273 Mark Whittow disagreed that the revolt was ethnic in its nature and emphasized that it was a reaction to the weakness of Rome and its inability to protect Palmyra from the Persians.74 Warwick Ball viewed the rebellion as aimed at Romes throne not just Palmyrene independence.75 Vaballathus inscriptions indicated the style of a Roman emperor according to Ball Zenobia and Vaballathus were contenders for the Roman imperial throne following a plan similar to that of Vespasian who ascended the throne after building his powerbase in Syria.7574 Andrew M. Smith II considered the revolt as a bid for both independence and the Roman throne.76 The Palmyrene royalty used Eastern titles such as king of kings which had no relevance in Roman politics while the conquests were in the interest of Palmyrene commerce.76 Finally it was only in the last regnal year of Zenobia and Vaballathus that the Roman imperial rank was claimed.76 Fergus Millar although tending toward the view that it was not only an independence movement believes there is not yet enough evidence to draw a conclusion on the nature of Palmyras revolt.77 During the midtwentieth century interest in the Palmyrene Empire was briefly revived by the advent of Syrian nationalism.78 Modern Syrian nationalists viewed the empire as a uniquely Syrian civilization which attempted to liberate the masses of the Levant from Roman tyranny.79 A Syrian TV show was produced based on Zenobias life and she was the subject of a biography written by Syrias former minister of defense Mustafa Tlass.79 See alsoedit Gallic Empire Notesedit  Alexandria was the second largest city in the Roman Empire after Rome itself2 with a population of around 500000600000 during the principate.3 The population of Palmyra in the middle of the 
3 rd century is estimated to have been 1500002000
00.4   No evidence exists for Roman units serving in the ranks of Odaenathus whether Roman soldiers fought under Odaenathus or not is a matter of speculation.14  The first decisive evidence for the use of this title for Odaenathus is an inscription dated to 271 posthumously describing Odaenathus as king of kings.1119 Odaenathus son Hairan I is directly attested as King of Kings during his lifetime. Hairan I was proclaimed by his father as coruler it is unlikely that Odaenathus was simply a king while his son held the King of Kings title.20  Claudius died in August 270 shortly before Zenobias invasion of Egypt.37  All other accounts indicate that a military action was not necessary as it seems that Zenobia had withdrawn her forces in order to defend Syria.47  Daphne was a garden located six miles south of Antioch.53 Referencesedit  Vagi David L. 2000.
