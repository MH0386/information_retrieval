18 th Dynasty Smenkhkare alternatively romanized Smenkhare Smenkare or Smenkhkara meaning Vigorous is the soul of Re was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of unknown background who lived and ruled during the Amarna Period of the 
18 th Dynasty. Smenkhkare was husband to Meritaten the daughter of his likely coregent Akhenaten. Since the Amarna period was subject to a largescale condemnation of memory by later pharaohs very little can be said of Smenkhkare with certainty and he has hence been subject to immense speculation.2 Origin and familyedit Smenkhkares origins are unknown. It is assumed he was a member of the royal family likely either a brother or son of the pharaoh Akhenaten. If he is Akhenatens brother his mother was likely either Tiye or Sitamun.3 If a son of Akhenaten he was presumably an older brother of Tutankhamun as he succeeded the throne ahead of him4 his mother was likely an unknown lesser wife.5 An alternative suggestion based on objects from the tomb of Tutankhamun is that Smenkhkare was the son of Akhenatens older brother Thutmose and an unknown woman possibly one of his sisters.6 Smenkhkare is known to have married Akhenatens eldest daughter Meritaten who was his Great Royal Wife.7 Inscriptions mention a Kings Daughter named Meritaten Tasherit who may be the daughter of Meritaten and Smenkhkare.89 Furthermore Smenkhkare has been put forth as a candidate for the mummy in KV55. If so he would be the father of Tutankhamun. Reign as pharaohedit Length of reignedit Clear evidence for a sole reign for Smenkhkare has not yet been found. There are few artifacts that attest to his existence at all and so it is assumed his reign was short. A wine docket from the house of Smenkhkare attests to Regnal Year 
1.1 0 A second wine docket dated to Year 1 refers to him as Smenkhkare deceased and may indicate that he died during his first regnal year.1112 Some Egyptologists have speculated about the possibility of a two or threeyear reign for Smenkhkare based on a number of wine dockets from Amarna that lack a kings name but bear dates for regnal years 2 and 
3.1 3 However they could belong to any of the Amarna kings and are not definitive proof either way.14 Smenkhkare Halledit While there are few monuments or artifacts that attest to Smenkhkares existence there is a major addition to the Amarna palace complex that bears his name. It was built in approximately Year 15 and was likely built for a significant event related to him. Theories of timing of Smenkhkares reignedit Academic consensus has yet to be reached about when exactly Smenkhkare ruled as pharaoh and where he falls in the timeline of Amarna. In particular the confusion of his identity compared to that of Pharaoh Neferneferuaten has led to considerable academic debate about the order of kings in the late Amarna Period. Aidan Dodson suggests that Smenkhkare did not have a sole reign and only served as Akhenatens coregent for about a year around Regnal Year 
13.1 5 However James Peter Allen depicts Smenkhkare as successor to Neferneferuaten16 and Marc Gabolde has suggested that after Smenkhkares reign Meritaten succeeded him as Neferneferuaten. Coregency with Akhenatenedit Per Dodsons theory Smenkhkare served only as coregent with Akhenaten and never had an individual rule and Nefertiti became coregent and eventual successor to Akhenaten.17 Smenkhkare and Meritaten appear together in the tomb of Meryre II at Amarna rewarding Meryre. There Smenkhkare wears the khepresh crown however he is called the soninlaw of Akhenaten. Further his name appears only during Akhenatens reign without certain evidence to attest to a sole reign.18 The names of the king have since been cut out but were recorded around 1850 by Karl Lepsius.19 Additionally a calcite globular vase from Tutankhamuns tomb displays the full double cartouches of both pharaohs. However this is the only object known to carry both names sidebyside.20 This evidence has been taken by some Egyptologists to indicate that Akhenaten and Smenkhkare were coregents. However the scene in Meryres tomb is undated and Akhenaten is neither depicted nor mentioned in the tomb. The jar may simply be a case of one king associating himself with a predecessor. The simple association of names particularly on everyday objects is not conclusive of a coregency.2122 Smenkhkare as successor to Neferneferuatenedit Arguing against the coregency theory Allen suggests that Neferneferuaten followed Akhenaten and that upon her death Smenkhkare ascended as pharaoh. Allen proposes that following Nefertitis death in Year 13 or 14 her daughter Neferneferuatentasherit became Pharaoh Neferneferuaten.16 After Neferneferuatens short rule of two or three years according to Allen Smenkhkare became pharaoh.16 Under this theory both pharaohs succeeded Akhenaten Neferneferuaten as the chosen successor and Smenkhkare as a rival with the same prenomen perhaps to challenge Akhenatens unacceptable choice.23 However a hieratic inscription discovered at the limestone quarry at Dayr Abu Hinnis suggests that Nefertiti was alive in Akhenatens Year 16 undermining this theory.24 There Nefertiti is referred to as the pharaohs Great Royal Wife.2526 Furthermore work is believed to have halted on the Amarna tombs shortly after Year 
13.2 728 Therefore the depiction of Smenkhkare in Meryres tomb must date to no later than Year 13. For him to have succeeded Neferneferuaten means that aside from a lone wine docket he left not a single trace over the course of five to six years. Meritaten as successor to Smenkhkareedit In comparison to the theories mentioned above Marc Gabolde has advocated that Smenkhkares Great Royal Wife Meritaten became Pharaoh Neferneferuaten after her husbands death. The main argument against this is a box Carter 0
01 k from Tutankhamuns tomb that lists Akhenaten Neferneferuaten and Meritaten as three separate individuals. There Meritaten is explicitly listed as Great Royal Wife.29 Further various private stelae depict the female pharaoh with Akhenaten. However under this theory Akhenaten would be dead by the time Meritaten became pharaoh as Neferneferuaten. Gabolde suggest that these depictions are retrospective. Yet since these are private cult stelae it would require a number of people to get the same idea to commission a retrospective commemorative stela at the same time. Allen notes that the everyday interaction portrayed in them more likely indicates two living people.22 Identity and confusion over regnal nameedit Line drawing from the tomb of Meryre II  the lost names had been recorded previously inset as Smenkhkare and Meritaten There has been much confusion in identifying artifacts related to Smenkhkare because another pharaoh from the Amarna Period bears the same or similar royal titulary. In 1978 it was proposed that there were two individuals using the same name a male king Smenkhkare and a female Neferneferuaten.30 Neferneferuaten has since been identified as a female pharaoh who ruled during the Amarna Period and is generally accepted as a separate person from Smenkhkare.3132 Neferneferuaten is theorized to be either Nefertiti Meritaten or more rarely Neferneferuaten Tasherit. After their initial rediscovery Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten were assumed to be the same person because of their similar prenomen throne name.33 Typically throne names in Ancient Egypt were unique. Thus the use of similar titulary led to a great deal of confusion among Egyptologists.34 For the better part of a century the repetition of throne names was taken to mean that Smenkhare changed his name to Neferneferuaten at some point probably upon the start of his sole reign. Indeed Petrie makes exactly that distinction in his 1894 excavation notes. Later a different set of names emerged using the same Ankhkheperure mery Neferkheperure Akhenaten Neferneferuaten mery Wa en Re Akhenaten.34 Smenkhkare can be differentiated from Neferneferutaten by the lack of an epithet associated with his throne name.3536 James Peter Allen pointed out the name Ankhkheperure nearly always included the epithet desired of Wa en Re referring to Akhenaten when coupled with the nomen Neferneferuaten. There were no occasions where Ankhkheprure plus epithet occurred alongside Smenkhkare nor was plain Ankhkheperure ever found associated with the nomen Neferneferuaten.37 However differentiating between the two individuals when Ankhkheperure occurs alone is complicated by the Pawah graffito from TT139. Here Ankhkheperure is used alone twice when referring to Neferneferutaten.38 In some instances a female version Ankhetkheperure occurs in this case the individual is Neferneferuaten.3536 The issue of a female Neferneferuaten was finally settled for the remaining holdouts when Allen confirmed Marc Gaboldes findings that objects from Tutankhamuns tomb originally inscribed for Neferneferuaten which had been read using the epithet ...desired of Akhenaten were originally inscribed as Akhetenhyes or effective for her husband.3940 Theoriesedit Akhenaten and Smenkhkare as homosexual coupleedit Theories arose when the two pharaohs Smenkhkare and Neferneferutaten were still considered the same male person that he and Akhenaten could have been homosexual lovers or even married. This is because of artwork clearly showing Akhenaten in familiar intimate poses with another pharaoh. For example stele in Berlin depicts a pair of royal figures one in the double crown and the other who appears to be a woman in the khepresh crown. However the set of three empty cartouches can only account for the names of a king and queen. This has been interpreted to mean that at one point Nefertiti may have been a coregent as indicated by the crown but not entitled to full pharaonic honors such as the double cartouche.41 Furthermore it is now accepted that other artifacts similar to this one are depictions of Akhenaten and Neferneferuaten. Nefertiti as Smenkhkareedit Alternatively once the feminine traces were discovered in some versions of the throne names it was proposed that Nefertiti was masquerading as Smenkhkare and later changed her name back to Neferneferuaten. There would be precedent for presenting a female pharaoh as a male such as Hatshepsut had done generations prior. Evidenceedit This image is commonly taken to be Smenkhkare and Meritaten although it may be Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun The Coregency Stela U.C. 410 now in the Petrie Museum. Although badly damaged partial inscriptions survive. It shows the double cartouche of Akhenaten alongside that of Ankhkheperure meryWaenre Neferneferuaten Akhetenhyes effective for her husband. The inscription originally bore the single cartouche of Nefertiti which was erased along with a reference to Meritaten to make room for the double cartouche of King Neferneferuaten.42 Line drawings of a block depicting the nearly complete names of King Smenkhkare and Meritaten as Great Royal Wife were recorded before the block was lost. Flinders Petrie documented six rings bearing only the Throne Name Ankhkheperure the other six with the same Throne Name show an epithet or Mery Neferkheperure no. 92 and no. 93 or Mery Waenre no. 94 95 and 96 and two more bearing Smenkhkare with another one bearing the epithet Djeserkheperu which belonged to Smenkhkare43 in excavations of the palace.44 One example is Item UC23800 in the Petrie Museum which clearly shows the djeser and kheperu elements and a portion of the ka glyph. Pendlebury found more when the town was cleared.45 A ring bearing his name is found at Malqata in Thebes. Perhaps the most magnificent was a vast hall more than 125 metres square and including over 500 pillars. This late addition to the central palace has been known as the Hall of Rejoicing Coronation Hall or simply Smenkhkare Hall because a number of bricks stamped Ankhkheperure in the House of Rejoicing in the Aten were found at the site.46 Indisputable images for Smenkhkare are rare. Aside from the tomb of Meryre II a carved and painted relief showing an Amarna king and queen in a garden is often attributed to him. It is completely without inscription but since they do not look like Tutankhamun or his queen they are often assumed to be Smenkhkare and Meritaten but Akhenaten and Nefertiti are sometimes put forth as well. An inscription in the tomb of Pairi TT139 by the other Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten mentions a functioning Amen temple of Ankhkheperure.47 Several items from the tomb of Tutankhamun bear the name of Smenkhkare A linen garment decorated with 39 gold daisies along with 47 other sequins bearing the prenomen of Smenkhkare alongside Meritatens name.

56 b were both reworked for Tutankhamun.48 Less certain but much more impressive is the second anthropoid coffin containing the mummy of Tutankhamun. The face depicted is much more square than that of the other coffins and quite unlike the gold mask or other depictions of Tutankhamun. The coffin is rishi style and inlaid with coloured glass a feature only found on this coffin and one from KV55 the speculated resting place for the mummy of Smenkhkare. Since both cartouches show signs of being reworked Dodson and Harrison conclude this was most likely originally made for Smenkhkare and reinscribed for Tutankhamun.4849 As the evidence came to light in bits and pieces at a time when Smenkhkare was assumed to have also used the name Neferneferuaten perhaps at the start of his sole reign it sometimes defied logic. For instance when the mortuary wine docket surfaced from the House of Smenkhkare deceased it seemed to appear that he changed his name back before he died. Since his reign was brief and he may never have been more than coregent the evidence for Smenkhkare is not plentiful but nor is it quite as insubstantial as it is sometimes made out to be. It certainly amounts to more than just a few rings and a wine docket or that he appears only at the very end of Ahkenatons reign in a few monuments50 as is too often portrayed. Death and burialedit The desecrated royal coffin found in tomb KV55 The location of Smenkhkares burial is unconfirmed. He has been put forward as a candidate for the mummy discovered in KV55 which rested in a desecrated rishi coffin with the owners name removed. It is generally accepted that the coffin was originally intended for a female and later reworked to accommodate a male.51 Over the past century the chief candidates for this individual have been either Akhenaten or Smenkhkare.525354 The case for Smenkhkare comes mostly from the presumed age of the mummy see below which between ages 18 and 26 would not fit Akhenaten who reigned for 17 years and had fathered a child near by his first regnal year. There is nothing in the tomb positively identified as belonging to Smenkhkare nor is his name found there. The tomb is certainly not befitting any king but even less so for Akhenaten. The skull of the mummy in KV55 believed to be Smenkhkare In 1980 James Harris and Edward F. Wente conducted Xray examinations of New Kingdom Pharaohs crania and skeletal remains which included the supposed mummified remains of Smenkhkare. The authors determined that the royal mummies of the 
18 th Dynasty bore strong similarities to contemporary Nubians with slight differences.55 Initial studies conducted on the KV55 mummy indicated that the individual was a young man with no apparent abnormalities in his midtwenties or younger.5657 Another study used craniofacial analysis and examined past xrays on several 
18 th Dynasty mummies. That study found close cranial similarities between the mummies of Tutankhamun KV55 and Thutmose IV.58 In addition seriological tests published in Nature in 1974 indicated that the KV55 mummy and Tutankhamun shared the same rare blood type.59 This information led Egyptologists to conclude that the KV55 mummy was either the father or brother of Tutankhamun. A brother seemed more likely since the age would only be old enough to plausibly father a child at the upper extremes. However the academic debate was believed concluded following a 2010 genetic study performed by Zahi Hawass that determined that the parents of Tutankhamun were likely the KV55 mummy and The Younger Lady mummy from KV
35.6 0 Chief among the genetic results was The statistical analysis revealed that the mummy KV55 is most probably the father of Tutankhamun probability of 
99.9 9999981 and KV35 Younger Lady could be identified as his mother 
99.9 99999
97.6 1 The study further identified the two mummies as children of Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye.62 CT scans also performed on the KV55 mummy indicated that his age at the time of death was likely higher than previous estimates based on the reveal of agerelated degeneration in the spine and osteoarthritis in the knees and spine.63 These estimates placed the mummys age at death closer to 40 years than 
25.6 3 This led to further belief that the mummy was in fact Akhenaten. However evidence to support the much older claim was not provided beyond the single point of spinal degeneration. Other scholars still dispute Hawasss assessment of the mummys age and the identification of KV55 as Akhenaten.5764656667686970 Where Filer and Strouhal relied on multiple indicators to determine the younger age the new study cited one point to indicate a much older age. One letter to the JAMA editors came from Arizona State University bioarchaeologist Brenda J. Baker. The content was retold on the Archaeology News Network website and is representative of a portion of the dissent A specialist in human osteology and paleopathology Baker takes issue with the identification of the skeletonized mummy KV55 as Tutankhamuns father Akhenaten. The authors Hawass et al in JAMA place this individuals age at the time of death at 3545 despite producing no evidence that repudiates wellknown prior examinations citing the age in the 1826 range. These earlier analyses  documented with written descriptions photographs and radiographs  show a pattern of fused and unfused epiphyses caps on ends of growing bones throughout the skeleton indicating a man much younger than Akhenaten is believed to have been at the time of his death. Baker also uses a photograph of the pubic symphysis of the pelvis to narrow the age of KV55 to 1823 based on recent techniques used in osteology and forensic anthropology.71 An examination of the KV55 mummy was conducted in 1998 by Czech anthropologist Eugene Strouhal. He published his conclusions in 2010 where he utterly excluded the possibility of Akhenaten The unambiguous male skeleton from Tomb 55 proved decisively by a long list of biological developmental features his age at death to be in the range of 1922 years which fully agrees with the results of the previous determination by Harrison 1966... He did not possess the slightest dental pathology and not even the onset of degenerative changes in the spine and joints.72 Referencesedit  a b Clayton P.
