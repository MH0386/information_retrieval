It is used to build and maintain lists of pagesprimarily for the sake of the lists themselves and their use in article and category maintenance. It is not part of the encyclopedias categorization scheme. More information This category is hidden on its member pagesunless the corresponding user preference Appearance  Show hidden categories is set. These categories are used to track build and organize lists of pages needing attention en masse for example pages using deprecated syntax or that may need to be edited at someones earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or subcategories into a larger more efficient list discriminated by classifications. Typically tracking categories are automatically populated by templates invoked in pages or by the MediaWiki software see SpecialTrackingCategories for an overview of the latter.
