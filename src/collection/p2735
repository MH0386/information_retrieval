Dynasty XIII initially ruled from the Nile Delta to the second cataract of the Nile. However the dynasty marked a period of decline and instability with Dynasty XIV rising concurrently and the Hyksos Dynasty XV taking control shortly after. Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep is usually considered Dynasty XIIIs first pharaoh and Merneferre Ay while not the final pharaoh was the last to occupy the Middle Kingdom capital of Itjtawy and the last of the dynasty with a significant recorded reign. Chronology and rulersedit Kim S. B. Ryholt dates Dynasty XIII from approximately 1803 BC until approximately 1649 BC.
1 page needed According to Ryholt the 
13 th Dynasty had some continuity with the preceding 
12 th Dynasty. With the first pharaoh Sobekhotep I being the son of a certain Amenemhat Ryholt proposes Amenemhat IV as a possible father.
1 page needed This is unlikely as Amenemhat IV was succeeded by his sister Sobekneferu and not directly by Sobekhotep I suggesting that Amenemhat IV didnt have any children.citation needed Ryholt also proposes that the demarcation between the two dynasties reflects the rise of the independent 
14 th Dynasty in the eastern Delta an event which he proposes occurred during Sobekneferus reign.
1 page needed As direct heirs to the kings of the 
12 th Dynasty pharaohs of the 
13 th Dynasty reigned from Memphis over Middle and Upper Egypt all the way to the second cataract to the south. The power of the 
13 th Dynasty waned progressively over its 150 years of existence and it finally came to an end with the conquest of Memphis by the Hyksos rulers of the 
15 th Dynasty c. 1650 BC.
1 page needed In later texts this dynasty is usually described as an era of chaos and disorder. However the period may have been more peaceful than was once thought since the central government in Itjtawy near the Faiyum was sustained during most of the dynasty and the country remained relatively stable. The period was undoubtedly characterized by decline with a large number of kings with short reigns and only a few attestations. The true chronology of this dynasty is difficult to determine as there are few monuments dating from the period. Many of the kings names are only known from odd fragmentary inscriptions or from scarabs. citation needed The names and order in the table are based on Dodson and Hilton and Ryholt.12 Dynasty XIII pharaohs Name of pharaoh Image Dates Burial Consorts Comments Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep I 18031800 BC The dominant hypothesis is that Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep was the founder of the dynasty34 in older studies Wegaf Sonbef 18001796 BC Perhaps a son of Amenemhat IV and brother of Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep.3 Nerikare 1796 BC Sekhemkare Amenemhat V 17961793 BC Ameny Qemau 17951792 BC Pyramid of Ameny Qemau Hotepibre Qemau Siharnedjheritef5 17921790 BC Perhaps identical with King Sehotepibre in the Turin Canon Iufni 17901788 BC Known only from the Turin canon Seankhibre AmenyIntefAmenemhat VI 17881785 BC Semenkare Nebnuni 17851783 BC or 1739 BC Sehetepibre Sewesekhtawy 17831781 BC Sewadjkare I 1781 BCE Known only from the Turin canon Nedjemibre 7 months 1780 BC or 1736 BC Known only from the Turin canon Khaankhre Sobekhotep II 17801777 BC Renseneb Amenemhat 1777 BC Awybre Hor 17771775 BC Buried in Dahshur near the pyramid of Amenemhet III Nubhetepti  Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw 17751772 BC Possibly a son of Hor Awybre.

Last king to be attested in both Lower and Upper Egypt. Following these kings the remaining rulers of the 
13 th Dynasty are only attested by finds from Upper Egypt. This may indicate the abandonment of the old capital Itjtawy in favor of Thebes.9 Daphna Ben Tor believes that this event was triggered by the invasion of the eastern Delta and the Memphite region by Canaanite rulers. For some authors this marks the end of the Middle Kingdom and the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period.9 This analysis is rejected by Ryholt and Baker however who note that the stele of Seheqenre Sankhptahi reigning toward the end of the dynasty strongly suggests that he reigned over Memphis. The stele is of unknown provenance.34 Dynasty XIII pharaohs continued Image Pharaoh Comments Merhotepre Ini Also known as Ini I Sankhenre Sewadjtu Mersekhemre Ined Possibly the same as Neferhotep II Sewadjkare Hori Also known as Hori II Merkawre Sobekhotep VII Eight kings names lost Merkheperre Merkare Known only from the Turin canon One lost king Sewadjare Mentuhotep V ...mosre Ibi ...maatre Hor ... ...webenre Se...kare Seheqenre Sankhptahi Represented on a stele offering to Ptah ...re Se...enre Possibly the Turin canons preservation of the prenomen Sewahenre.

This is now the dominant hypothesis in Egyptology4 and Sobekhotep Sekhemre Khutawy is referred to as Sobekhotep I in this article. Ryholt thus credits Sekhemre Khutawy Sobkhotep I with a reign of 3 to 4 years c. 1800 BC and proposes that Khaankhre Sobekhotep II reigned c. 20 years later in 1780 BC.3 Dodson and Hilton similarly believe that Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep predated Khaankhre Sobekhotep.10 Successorsedit Statue of the royal sealer and high steward Gebu 
13 th dynasty c. 1700 BC from the temple of Amun in Karnak. After allowing discipline at the southern forts to deteriorate the government eventually withdrew its garrisons and not long afterward the forts were reoccupied by the rising Nubian state of Kush. In the north Lower Egypt was overrun by the Hyksos a Semitic people from across the Sinai. An independent line of kings created Dynasty XIV that arose in the western Delta during later Dynasty XIII. According to Manetho into this unstable mix came invaders from the east called the Hyksos who seized Egypt without striking a blow and having overpowered the rulers of the land they then burned our cities ruthlessly razed to the ground the temples of gods... Their regime called Dynasty XV was claimed to have replaced Dynasties XIII and XIV in most of the country. However recent archaeological finds at Edfu could indicate that the Hyksos 
15 th dynasty was already in existence at least by the mid
13 th dynasty reign of king Sobekhotep IV. In a recently published paper in Egypt and the Levant11 Nadine Moeller Gregory Marouard and N. Ayers discuss the discovery of an important early 
12 th dynasty Middle Kingdom administrative building in the eastern Tell Edfu area of Upper Egypt which was in continual use into the early Second Intermediate Period until the 
17 th dynasty when its remains were sealed up by a large silo court. Fieldwork by Egyptologists in 2010 and 2011 into the remains of the former 
12 th dynasty building which was also used in the 
13 th dynasty led to the discovery of a large adjoining hall which proved to contain 41 sealings showing the cartouche of the Hyksos ruler Khyan together with 9 sealings naming the 
13 th dynasty king Sobekhotep IV.12 The preserved contexts of these seals shows that Sobekhotep IV and Khyan were most likely contemporaries of one another. This could mean that the 
13 th dynasty did not control all of Egypt when Sobekhotep IV acceded to power and that there was a significant overlap between the 
13 th and 
15 th dynasties since Sobekhotep IV was only a mid
13 th dynasty ruler although one of its most powerful kings. Therefore Manethos statement that the Hyksos 
15 th dynasty violently replaced the 
13 th dynasty could be a piece of later Egyptian propaganda. Rather the 
13 th dynastys authority must have been collapsing throughout Egypt in its final decades and the Hyksos state in the Delta region simply took over Memphis and ended the 
13 th dynastys kingdom. However this analysis and the conclusions drawn from it are rejected by Egyptologist Robert Porter who argues that Khyan ruled much later than Sobekhotep IV a gap of c. 100 years exists between the two in conventional chronologies and that the seals of a pharaoh were used long after his death. Thus the seals of Sobekhotep IV might not indicate that he was a contemporary of Khyan.13 Merneferre Ay was the last Egyptian ruler of the 
13 th Dynasty who is attested by objects in both Lower and Upper Egypt.14 Henceforth his successors from Merhotepre Ini on are only attested in Upper Egypt.15 Referencesedit  a b c d e f Kim S. B.
