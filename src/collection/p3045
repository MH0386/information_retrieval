He was born in Aurantis Arabia in a city situated in modernday Syria. After the death of Gordian III in February 244 Philip who had been Praetorian prefect achieved power. He quickly negotiated peace with the Persian Sassanid Empire and returned to Rome to be confirmed by the Senate. During his reign the city of Rome celebrated its millennium. Philip was betrayed and killed at the Battle of Verona in September 249 following a rebellion led by his successor Gaius Messius Quintus Decius. Philips reign of five years was uncommonly stable in a turbulent third century.ab During the late 
3 rd century and into the 
4 th it was held by some churchmen that Philip had been the first Christian emperor he was described as such in Jeromes Chronicon Chronicle which was well known during the Middle Ages in Orosius highly popular Historia Adversus Paganos History Against the Pagans and was presented as a Christian in Eusebius of Caesareas Historia Ecclesiastica Ecclesiastical History.5 Modern scholars are divided on the issue. Early lifeedit Possible bust of Otacilia Severa wife of Philip. Little is known about Philips early life and political career. He was born in what is today Shahba Syria about 90 kilometres 56 mi southeast of Damascus in Trachonitis.6 His birth city later renamed Philippopolis lay within Aurantis an Arab district which at the time was part of the Roman province of Arabia.7 Most historians accept that Philip was indeed an Arab7891011 but this ethnic identification remains uncertain.12 He was the son of a local citizen Julius Marinus possibly of some importance.13 Allegations from later Roman sources Historia Augusta and Epitome de Caesaribus that Philip had a very humble origin or even that his father was a leader of brigands are not accepted by modern historians.14 His birth date is not recorded by contemporary sources but the 
7 thcentury Chronicon Paschale records that he died at the age of

38.1 3 The rise to the purple of the Severans from nearby Emesa is noted as a motivational factor in Philips own ascent due to geographic and ethnic similarity between himself and the Emesan emperors.cd Accession to the throneedit Rockface relief at Naqshe Rostam of Shapur I on horseback with Philip and Valerian kneeling in surrender to the Persian king.efg Philips rise to prominence began through the intervention of his brother Priscus who was an important official under the emperor Gordian III.13 His big break came in 243 during Gordian IIIs campaign against Shapur I of Persia when the Praetorian prefect Timesitheus died under unclear circumstances.21 At the suggestion of his brother Priscus Philip became the new Praetorian prefect with the intention that the two brothers would control the young Emperor and rule the Roman world as unofficial regents.13 Following a military defeat Gordian III died in February 244 under circumstances that are still debated. While some claim that Philip conspired in his murder other accounts including one coming from the Persian point of view state that Gordian died in battle.21622 Whatever the case Philip assumed the purple robe following Gordians death. Philip was not willing to repeat the mistakes of previous claimants and was aware that he had to return to Rome in order to secure his position with the Senate.6 However his first priority was to conclude a peace treaty with Shapur and withdraw the army from a potentially disastrous situation.623 Although Philip was accused of abandoning territory the actual terms of the peace were not as humiliating as they could have been.23 Philip apparently retained Timesitheus reconquest of Osroene and Mesopotamia but he had to agree that Armenia lay within Persias sphere of influence.24 He also had to pay an enormous indemnity to the Persians of 500000 denarii.2423 Philip immediately issued coins proclaiming that he had made peace with the Persians pax fundata cum Persis.23 Coin of Severa.

Leading his army back up the Euphrates south of Circesium Philip erected a cenotaph in honor of Gordian III but his ashes were sent ahead to Rome where he arranged for Gordian IIIs deification.625 Whilst in Antioch he left his brother Priscus as extraordinary ruler of the Eastern provinces with the title of rector Orientis.62313 Moving westward he gave his brotherinlaw Severianus control of the provinces of Moesia and Macedonia.26 He arrived in Rome in the late summer of 244 where he was confirmed augustus.6 Before the end of the year he nominated his young son caesar heir his wife Marcia Otacilia Severa was named augusta and he also deified his father Marinus even though the latter had never been emperor.23 While in Rome Philip also claimed a victory over the Persians with the titles of Persicus Maximus Parthicus Maximus and Parthicus Adiabenicus the latter probably unofficially.27 Reignedit In an attempt to shore up his regime Philip put a great deal of effort in maintaining good relations with the Senate and from the beginning of his reign he reaffirmed the old Roman virtues and traditions.23 He quickly ordered an enormous building program in his home town renaming it Philippopolis and raising it to civic status while he populated it with statues of himself and his family.25 He also introduced the ActiaDusaria Games in Bostra capital of Arabia. This festival combined the worship of Dushara the main Nabataean deity with commemoration of the Battle of Actium as part of the Roman Imperial cult.28 The creation of the new city of Philippopolis piled on top of the massive tribute owed to the Persians as well as the necessary donativum to the army to secure its acceptance of his accession made Philip desperately short of money.25 To pay for it he ruthlessly increased levels of taxation while at the same time he ceased paying subsidies to the tribes north of the Danube that were vital for keeping the peace on the frontiers.29 Both decisions would have significant impacts upon the empire and his reign.30 At the frontiers of the empireedit In 245 Philip was forced to leave Rome as the stability established by Timesitheus was undone by a combination of his death Gordians defeat in the east and Philips decision to cease paying the subsidies.630 The Carpi moved through Dacia crossed the Danube and emerged in Moesia where they threatened the Balkans.31 Establishing his headquarters in Philippopolis in Thrace he pushed the Carpi across the Danube and chased them back into Dacia so that by the summer of 246 he claimed victory against them along with the title Carpicus Maximus.3233 In the meantime the Arsacids of Armenia refused to acknowledge the authority of the Persian king Shapur I and war with Persia flared up again by 2

Nevertheless Philip was back in Rome by August 247 where he poured more money into the most momentous event of his reign  the Ludi Saeculares which coincided with the one thousandth anniversary of the foundation of Rome.32 So in April 248 AD April 1001 A.U.C. Philip had the honor of leading the celebrations of the one thousandth birthday of Rome which according to the empires official Varronian chronology was founded on 21 April 753 BC by Romulus. Commemorative coins such as the one illustrated at left were issued in large numbers and according to contemporary accounts the festivities were magnificent and included spectacular games ludi saeculares and theatrical presentations throughout the city.34 In the Colosseum in what had been originally prepared for Gordian IIIs planned Roman triumph over the Persians35 more than 1000 gladiators were killed along with hundreds of exotic animals including hippos leopards lions giraffes and one rhinoceros.36 The events were also celebrated in literature with several publications including Asinius Quadratus History of a Thousand Years specially prepared for the anniversary.13 At the same time Philip elevated his son to the rank of coaugustus.13 Downfalledit Despite the festive atmosphere there were continued problems in the provinces. In late 248 the legions of Pannonia and Moesia dissatisfied with the result of the war against the Carpi rebelled and proclaimed Tiberius Claudius Pacatianus emperor.13 The resulting confusion tempted the Quadi and other Germanic tribes to cross the frontier and raid Pannonia.32 At the same time the Goths invaded Moesia and Thrace across the Danube frontier and laid siege to Marcianopolis37 as the Carpi encouraged by the Gothic incursions renewed their assaults in Dacia and Moesia.32 Meanwhile in the East Marcus Jotapianus led another uprising in response to the oppressive rule of Priscus and the excessive taxation of the Eastern provinces.1326 Two other usurpers Marcus Silbannacus and Sponsianus are reported to have started rebellions without much success.13 Aureus of Philip. Overwhelmed by the number of invasions and usurpers Philip offered to resign but the Senate decided to throw its support behind the emperor with a certain Gaius Messius Quintus Decius most vocal of all the senators.38 Philip was so impressed by his support that he dispatched Decius to the region with a special command encompassing all of the Pannonian and Moesian provinces. This had a dual purpose of both quelling the rebellion of Pacatianus as well as dealing with the barbarian incursions.3832 Although Decius managed to quell the revolt discontent in the legions was growing.30 Decius was proclaimed emperor by the Danubian armies in the spring of 249 and immediately marched on Rome.3813 Yet even before he had left the region the situation for Philip had turned even more sour. Financial difficulties had forced him to debase the antoninianus as rioting began to occur in Egypt causing disruptions to Romes wheat supply and further eroding Philips support in the capital.39 Although Decius tried to come to terms with Philip38 Philips army met the usurper near modern Verona that summer. Decius easily won the battle and Philip was killed sometime in September 2494039 either in the fighting or assassinated by his own soldiers who were eager to please the new ruler.13 Philips elevenyearold son and heir may have been killed with his father and Priscus disappeared without a trace.40 Religious beliefsedit Further information Philip the Arab and Christianity Some later traditions first mentioned by the historian Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History held that Philip was the first Christian Roman Emperor. According to Eusebius Ecc. Hist. VI.34 Philip was a Christian but was not allowed to enter Easter vigil services until he confessed his sins and was ordered to sit among the penitents which he did willingly. Later versions located this event in Antioch.13 However historians generally identify the later Emperor Constantine baptized on his deathbed as the first Christian emperor and generally describe Philips adherence to Christianity as dubious because nonChristian writers do not mention the fact and because throughout his reign Philip to all appearances coinage etc. continued to follow the state religion.41 Critics ascribe Eusebius claim as probably due to the tolerance Philip showed towards Christians. See alsoedit Gothic War 248253 Explanatory notesedit  The five years of Philips reign were a time of uncommon stability and repose in a century notorious for turbulence.3  Philips reign was brief  just five years  but it was a stable one in the unstable third century.4  Severus deserves the ultimate credit for making possible the emergence of a figure such as Philip.7  The spectacle of Arab and halfArab emperors from neighboring Emesa must have left a deep impression on Marcus Julius Philippus.17  The two emperors who are named are shown in the way they are described Philip the Arab is kneeling asking for peace and Valerian is physically taken prisoner by pur. Consequently the relief must be made after 260 AD. 18  ... while another figure probably Philip the Arab kneels and the Sasanian king holds the illfated Emperor Valerian by his wrist.19  He recorded these deeds for posterity in both words and images at Naqshi Rustam and on the Kaabai Zardut near the ancient Achaemenid capital of Persepolis preserving for us a vivid image of two Roman emperors one kneeling probably Philip the Arab also defeated by Shapur and the second Valerian uncrowned and held captive at the wrist by a gloriously mounted Persian king.20 Citationsedit  Cooley Alison E. 2012.
