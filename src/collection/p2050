Since 1975 he has been Excavation Director and Restoration Director at various sites throughout Egypt predominantly Giza.5 From 1969 to 1975 Hawass was Inspector of Antiquities for a multitude of archaeological expeditions for instance the Yale Expedition at Abydos Egypt in 1969 and Abu Simbel between 1972 and 19
74.6  He sporadically taught Egyptian archaeology history and culture at universities in Egypt and the USA between 1988 and 2001 most notably at the American University in Cairo the University of California Los Angeles and Alexandria University. Hawass has described his efforts as trying to help institute a systematic program for the preservation and restoration of historical monuments while training Egyptians to improve their expertise on methods of excavation retrieval and preservation.7 Gizaedit Zahi Hawass and Barack Obama June 2009 Hawass was Inspector of Antiquities for Giza 197274 First Inspector until 1979 and Chief Inspector in 1980. Starting in 1987 he held the position of Director General of the Giza monuments which includes the sites of Giza Saqqara Memphis Dahshur Abusir and Bahariya Oasis. After the discovery of Gantenbrinks Door in 1993 he left the position  according to Hawass a resignation8  but was reinstated several months later following a change in leadership and the transformation of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization into the Supreme Council of Antiquities. He was promoted to Undersecretary of the State for the Giza Monuments in 19

09.1 213 2011 protest vandalismedit On January 29 2011 in the midst of the Egyptian protests of that year Hawass arrived at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo to find that a number of cases had been broken into and a number of antiquities damaged so police were brought in to secure the museum.14 According to Andrew Lawler reporting for Science Hawass said that he faxed a colleague in Italy that 13 cases were destroyed. My heart is broken and my blood is boiling.15 Hawass later told The New York Times that thieves looking for gold broke 70 objects including two sculptures of the pharaoh Tutankhamun and took two skulls from a research lab before being stopped as they left the museum.16 Minister of Antiquitiesedit Hawass was appointed to the position of Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs a newly created cabinet post by Mubarak on January 31 2011 as part of a cabinet shakeup during the 2011 protests.1516

They opened thirteen cases threw the seventy objects on the ground and broke them including one Tutankhamun case from which they broke the statue of the king on a panther. However the broken objects can all be restored and we will begin the restoration process this week.This quote needs a citation17 Hawass rejected comparisons with the looting of antiquities in Iraq and Afghanistan.16 On February 13 Mahmoud Kassem of Bloomberg reported Hawass as saying that 18 artifacts including statues of King Tutankhamun were stolen from the Egyptian Museum in January Kassem paraphrasing Hawass continues The missing objects include 11 wooden shabti statuettes from Yuya a gilded wooden statue of Tutankhamun carried by a goddess and a statue of Nefertiti making offerings.19 Egyptian state television reported that Hawass called upon Egyptians not to believe the lies and fabrications of the Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya satellite television channels.20 Hawass later said They should give us the opportunity to change things and if nothing happens they can march again. But you cant bring in a new president now in this time. We need Mubarak to stay and make the transition.16 On March 3 2011 he resigned after a list was posted on his personal website of dozens of sites across Egypt that were looted during the 2011 protests.2122232425 Hawass was reappointed Minister of Antiquities by thenPrime Minister Essam Sharaf.2627 On March 30 2011 a tweet was posted stating I am very happy to be the Minister of Antiquities once again28 but resigned on July 17 20

30 dubious  discussbetter source needed Claimed discoveriesedit Zahi Hawass at a book signing in Mexico City August 2003. As his biography at the National Geographic Explorers webpage notes he states that he is responsible for many recent discoveries including the tombs of the pyramid builders at Giza and the Valley of the Golden Mummies at Bahariya. At Giza he also uncovered the satellite pyramid of Khufu. In 2005 as part of the National Geographic Societysponsored Egyptian Mummy Project to learn more about patterns of disease health and mortality in ancient Egypt he led a team that CT scanned the mummy of King Tutankhamun. His team is continuing to CT scan mummies both royal and private and hopes to solve some of the mysteries surrounding the lives and deaths of such important figures as Hatshepsut and Nefertiti.31 Worksedit Main article List of works by Zahi Hawass Hawass has written and cowritten many books relating to Egyptology including The Curse of the Pharaohs My Adventures with Mummiescitation needed and King Tutankhamun The Treasures from the Tomb32 the latter published to coincide with a major exhibition in the UK.33
34 better source neededoriginal research He has also written on Tutankhamun for Ancient Egypt.citation needed Hawass is a regular columnist for Egypt Todaycitation needed and the online historical community Heritage Key.citation needed He has narrated several videos on Egyptology including a series on Tutankhamun.35 Appearancesedit Speaking on the International Congress of Egyptologists ICE in Cairo November 2019 Hawass has appeared on television specials on channels such as the National Geographic Channel the History Channel and the Discovery Channel.36 Hawass has also appeared in several episodes of the U.S. television show Digging for the Truth discussing mummies the pyramids Tutankhamun Cleopatra and Ramesses II. He also appeared on Unsolved Mysteries during a segment on the curse of Tutankhamuns tomb. In 2010 Hawass appeared on a realitybased television show on The History Channel called Chasing Mummies.37 Hawass also worked alongside Egyptologist Otto Schaden during the opening of Tomb KV63 in February 2006  the first intact tomb to be found in the Valley of the Kings since 19
22.3 8 In June 2007 Hawass announced that he and a team of experts may have identified the mummy of Hatshepsut39 in KV60 a small tomb in the Valley of the Kings.citation needed The opening of the sealed tomb was described in 2006 as one of the most important events in the Valley of the Kings for almost a hundred years.40 Hawass was interviewed about his work by Keith Floyd as part of his television series Floyd around the Med in the episode Cairo Egypt and Aswan to Luxor 2000. Hawass hosted and played further creative rolesclarification needed in the documentary Egypts Ten Greatest Discoveries.full citation needed Viewsedit Return of artifacts to Egyptedit Hawass has repeatedly spearheaded movements to return many prominent and irregularly taken Ancient Egyptian artifacts back to Egypt from collections in various other countries. Examples of these artifacts include the Rosetta Stone the bust of Nefertiti the Dendera zodiac ceiling painting from the Dendera Temple the bust of Ankhhaf the architect of the Khafre Pyramid the faces of Amenhotep IIIs tomb at the Louvre Museum the Luxor Temples obelisk at the Place de la Concorde and the statue of Hemiunu. In July 2003 the Egyptians requested the return of the Rosetta Stone from the British Museum. Hawass then serving as Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Cairo spoke at a press conference saying If the British want to be remembered if they want to restore their reputation they should volunteer to return the Rosetta Stone because it is the icon of our Egyptian identity.4142 Referring to Egyptian antiquities at the British Museum Hawass said These are Egyptian monuments. I will make life miserable for anyone who keeps them.43 Alex Joffe of the Wall Street Journal expressed the opinion that the looting of antiquities during the 2011 Egyptian revolution made Hawass campaign to return Egyptian antiquities to Egypt misguided or at least poorly timed.14 In 2019 Hawass relaunched his restitution campaign asking the Berlin State Museums the British Museum and the Muse du Louvre How can you refuse to lend to the new Grand Egyptian Museum when you have taken so many antiquities from Egypt All three museums refused his loan requests.44 In 2022 Hawass launched another petition calling once again for the return of the Rosetta Stone the bust of Nefertiti and the Dendera Zodiac ceiling to Egypt.45 He planned on sending the petition signed by a group of Egyptian intellectuals to European museums in October.4544 DNA testing of Egyptian mummiesedit Zahi Hawass examining a Mummy 2018. Further information List of DNAtested mummies Hawass has been skeptical of the DNA testing of Egyptian mummies From what I understand he has said it is not always accurate and it cannot always be done with complete success when dealing with mummies. Until we know for sure that it is accurate we will not use it in our research.46 In December 2000 a joint team from Waseda University in Japan and Cairos Ain Shams University tried to get permission for DNA testing of Egyptian mummies but was denied by the Egyptian Government.47 Hawass stated at the time that DNA analysis was out of the question because it would not lead to anything.citation needed48 In February 2010 Hawass and his team announced that they had analyzed the mummies of Tutankhamun and ten other mummies and said that the king could have died from a malaria infection that followed a leg fracture.49 German researchers Christian Timmann and Christian Meyer have cast doubt on this theory suggesting other possible alternatives for Tutankhamuns cause of death.50 In 2012 a study signed by Hawass disclosed that Ramses III may have had a haplogroup that is associated with the Bantu expansion and is the most dominant in SubSaharan Africa E

1 a.51 Controversiesedit Relationships with other archaeologistsedit Hawass has been accused of domineering behaviour forbidding archaeologists to announce their own findings and courting the media for his own gain after they were denied access to archaeological sites because according to Hawass they were too amateurish.52 A few however have said in interviews that some of what Hawass has done for the field was long overdue.52 Hawass has typically ignored or dismissed his critics and when asked about it he indicated that what he does is for the sake of Egypt and the preservation of its antiquities.53 Views on Jews and Israeledit Hawass has been a longstanding opponent of normalised relations between Israel and Egypt.54 In January 2009 Hawass wrote in Asharq AlAwsat The concept of killing women children and elderly people ... seems to run in the blood of the Jews of Palestine and that the only thing that the Jews have learned from history is methods of tyranny and tormentso much so that they have become artists in this field. He explained that he was not referring to the Jews original faith but rather the faith that they forged and contaminated with their poison which is aimed against all of mankind.55 In an interview on Egyptian television in April 2009 Hawass stated that although Jews are few in number they control the entire world and commented on the control they have of the American economy and the media.565758 He later wrote that he was using rhetoric to explain political fragmentation among the Arabs and that he does not believe in a Jewish conspiracy to control the world.59 Aftermath of 2011 protestsedit Criticism of Hawass in Egypt and more broadly increased following the protests in Egypt in 2011. On July 12 2011 The New York Times reported on a story on page A1 that Hawass receives an honorarium each year of as much as 200000 from National Geographic to be an explorerinresidence even as he controls access to the ancient sites it often features in its reports.60 The Times also reported that he has relationships with two American companies that do business in Egypt.60 On April 17 2011 Hawass was sentenced to jail for one year for refusing to obey a court ruling61 relating to a contract for the gift shop at the Egyptian Museum to a company with links to Hawass.60 The ruling was appealed and this specific sentence was suspended pending appeal.6162 The following day the National Council of Egypts Administrative Court issued a decree to overturn the courts original ruling specifying that he would serve no jail time and would instead remain in his position as Minister of Antiquities. The jail sentence was lifted after a new contract was solicited for the running of the gift shop.6063 Association with Mubarakedit As Minister of Antiquities Hawass was closely associated with the government of former President Hosni Mubarak. His resignation as minister on March 3 2011 and his reappointment to the Ministry on March 30 2011 have been seen as part of the overall events surrounding Mubaraks resignation. It was reported that his reappointment angered numerous factions who opposed the appointment of any of the old guard under Mubarak to new positions in the government.64 The 2011 Egyptian protests resulted in increased criticism of Hawass. Demonstrators called for his resignation and the upheaval increased attention on his relationship with the Mubarak family and the way in which he has increased his public profile in recent years.60 Commercial endeavoursedit Hawass has lent his name to a line of mens apparel described by The New York Times as a line of rugged khakis denim shirts and carefully worn leather jackets that are meant according to the catalog copy to hark back to Egypts golden age of discovery in the early 
20 th century the clothing was first sold at Harrods department store in London in April 20
11.6 1 Critics say the Hawass clothing commercializes Egyptian history and objected to their understanding that models had sat on or scuffed priceless ancient artifacts during the photo shoot an accusation that was denied by Hawass and the clothing manufacturers.61 Hawass already sells a line of Stetson hats reproducing the ones he wears which very much resemble the ones worn by Harrison Ford in the Indiana Jones movies.61 Zahi Hawass receives the Grand Prize of the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Culture 2018. Honorary degreesedit Hawass has received many honorary degrees. From outside Egypt he has received honorary doctorates from the University of Pennsylvania 200065 the University of Lisbon 201166 the Chandrakasem Rajabhat University 201167 the New Bulgarian University 201668 the Universidad Catlica Santo Domingo 201669 the Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola 201770 and the Russian State University for the Humanities 20
21.7 1 Recognition and awardsedit Hawass is the recipient of the Egyptian state award of the first degree for his work in the Sphinx restoration project.72 In 2001 he was silver medallist offered by the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences.73 In 2002 he was awarded the American Academy of Achievements Golden Plate and the glass obelisk from US scholars for his efforts to the protection and preservation of Ancient Egyptian monuments.7274 In 2003 Hawass was given international membership in the Russian Academy for Natural Sciences RANS72 and in 2006 he was chosen as one of the worlds 100 most influential people by Time.72 In 2015 He awarded the Golden Memorial Medal of Charles University.75 In 2018 he was awarded by the Academia Brasileira de Letras for being the only archaeologist who wrote more than 30 books.76 In the same year he received the Presidential Medal of the Republic of Kosovo in recognition for his entire academic output.77 Also in 2018 he received the grand prize of the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Culture.78 In 2022 he received the plaque of honour from the Faculty of Economics and Political Sciences of Cairo. 79 Honoursedit Peruvian President Alan Garca decorates Zahi Hawass with the insignia of Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun of Peru Lima 4 July 2011.

Its amazing to think how the story of a boy king who ruled for only about a decade thousands of years ago still attracts the interest of millions of people but thats exactly whats happened with Tutankhamun.  Known more fondly these days as King Tut which may have something to do with a struggle to spell his full name an exhibition of the wonders found with him in his final resting place is once again touring the world.  When the exhibit first went on tour in the 19
70 s the exhibition set records for the numbers of people who passed through the doors at various venues around the world to see it. It was last in London at the British Museum in 1972  the year I was born  so when I heard it would be returning to the city I figured this could be our once in a lifetime opportunity to see it.  The exhibition is made up of 11 galleries Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs is open at the O2 Dome in London from now until August 30 2008. Its next stop will be in Dallas Texas where the exhibition will open on October 3 2008.  The Death of King Tut Murder or Accident feat. Dr. Zahi Hawass  Heritage Key. November 21 2009.

2 CID 9019947. Abstract The cause of death of the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun has now for decades been matter of speculation and various hypotheses. A recent article in JAMA... provided new evidence and suggested malaria together with Khlers disease as the most probable cause of death of the boy king. We are sceptical towards this elucidation of the cause of death and discuss alternative and differential diagnoses among them sickle cell disease and Gauches disease.

Objective To investigate the true character of the harem conspiracy described in the Judicial Papyrus of Turin and determine whether Ramesses III was indeed killed.  Design Anthropological forensic radiological and genetic study of the mummies of Ramesses III and unknown man E found together and taken from the 
20 th dynasty of ancient Egypt circa 11901070 BC.  Results Computed tomography scans revealed a deep cut in Ramesses IIIs throat probably made by a sharp knife. During the mummification process a Horus eye amulet was inserted in the wound for healing purposes and the neck was covered by a collar of thick linen layers.  Forensic examination of unknown man E showed compressed skin folds around his neck and a thoracic inflation. Unknown man E also had an unusual mummification procedure. According to genetic analyses both mummies had identical haplotypes of the Y chromosome and a common male lineage.  Conclusions This study suggests that Ramesses III was murdered during the harem conspiracy by the cutting of his throat. Unknown man E is a possible candidate as Ramesses IIIs son Pentawere.  Specifically Genetic kinship analyses revealed identical haplotypes in both mummies using the Whit Atheys haplogroup predictor we determined the Y chromosomal haplogroup to be E

Zahi Hawass Egypts longtime chief antiquities official has been criticized in recent months for many things his closeness to former President Hosni Mubarak some inconsistent reports on the safety of archaeological sites during the uprising and for his role in a dispute over an Egyptian museum bookstore for which he now possibly faces jail time.  But the source of the latest controversy to beset Mr. Hawass resembles something straight from the mouth of J. Peterman the character on Seinfeld based on the clothing catalog retailer of the same name.  Mr. Hawass has lent his name to a mens wear brand a line of rugged khakis denim shirts and carefully worn leather jackets that are meant according to the catalog copy to hark back to Egypts golden age of discovery in the early
