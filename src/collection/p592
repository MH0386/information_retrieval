Three of these tombs in the form of giant pyramids are what is now the famed Giza pyramid complex featuring the Great Pyramid of Giza. Classical to medieval eraedit Giza and the bridge from Roda Island in c.1800 Description de lgypte As ancient Egypt passed under several conquests under the Persians Greeks Romans and Byzantines so did the area in what is now Giza. A Byzantine village named Phylake Greek  or Terso Coptic  meaning the fortress now Tersa was located south of Giza and should not be confused with it.171819 Egyptians called the area Tipersis Bohairic Coptic a and Sahidic Coptic   lit.the Persian fortress of Babylon.202122 Eutychius gives a legend the about citys name and its foundation by Artaxerxes Ochus while Abu Salih says it was found by a Persian king H at the same time as Qasr ashSham23 but in view of the fact that older evidence is missing it is perhaps most likely to have been founded during the Sasanian conquest of Egypt in the early 
7 th century.24 As Muslims of the fledgling Islamic caliphate went on with their conquest of Egypt from the Byzantine Empire beginning in 639 AD three years after their victory at the battle of Yarmouk in 636 AD they conquered all of the land by the time they captured the city of Alexandria in 641 AD. A year later in 642 AD year 21 in Islamic calendar they founded the city of Giza. The exact etymology of its name is unknown. AlMaqrizi suggested an irregular ArameoArabic root meaning edge side to be the source. EverettHeath suggested Ancient Egyptian rgsr on the side of the height pyramid. Peust also suggests a Persian etymology of the word from Middle Persian  romanized diz lit.fortress castle which Persians could have given to the pyramids or a fortress they found in the area.25 Infrastructureedit Sunset in Giza Giza has seen many changes over time. Changes in infrastructure during the different occupations of Egypt by various rulers including the British in the 
18 th and early 
20 th century focused on the construction of roads streets and buildings in the area. Giza is a thriving centre of Egyptian culture and is quite heavily populated with many facilities and buildings in the current area. Giza saw much attention in particular to its vast amount of ancient Egyptian monuments found on the Giza Plateau and has astonished thousands of visitors and tourists over the years. Gizas infrastructure saw much attention from both the British government prior to the 1952 coup dtat as well as the current Egyptian government due to the citys importance in tourism. Gizas St. George Cathedral is the episcopal see of the Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Giza. The city hosts the first zoo on the entire African continent and one of the oldest in the Mediterranean region the Giza Zoo. In addition there are several parks the most famous among them is Orman Park which means Forest Park in the Turkish language. Transportationedit The Cairo Metro line 2 Transportation in Giza comprises an extensive road network rail system subway system and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles taxi cabs privately owned public buses and microbuses.
