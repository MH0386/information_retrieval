WikiProject Ancient Egypt todo list edit history watch purge Needed articles. We should have an article on every pyramid and every nome in Ancient Egypt. Im sure the rest of us can think of other articles we should have. Cleanup. To start with most of the general history articles badly need attention. And Im told that at least some of the dynasty articles need work. Any other candidates Standardize the Chronology. A boring task but the benefit of doing it is that you can set the dates e.g. why say Khufu lived 25892566 As long as you keep the length of his reign correct or cite a respected source you can date it 25902567 or 25852563 Stub sorting Anyone I consider this probably the most unimportant of tasks on Wikipedia but if you believe it needs to be done . . . Data sorting. This is a project Id like to take on some day  could be applied to more of Wikipedia than just Ancient Egypt. Take one of the standard authorities of history or culture  Herotodus the Elder Pliny the writings of Breasted or Kenneth Kitchen  see if you cant smoothly merge quotations or information into relevant articles. Probably a good exercise for someone who owns one of those impressive texts yet cant get access to a research library.

20.9 4 talk 1834 16 April 2020 UTCreply NatHor an error for HatHoredit There is an English Wikipedia article for Hat Hor I think the name in the template is incorrect probably a typo. Looking at the articles for this person in the German and Spanish Wikipedias which have articles about him the German WP uses HatHor the Spanish uses Horus Hat. I think it should be fixed but wanted to ask first before making a significant change to the template. FeanorStar7 talk 0133 10 August 2020 UTCreply current template under Protodynastic Lower Egypt Wazner  NatHor de es  Mekh suggested change to template Wazner  HatHor  Mekh Canide and Animaledit Who are Canide and Animal The only references to these rulers appears to be in this template and related ones but they are otherwise completely absent from all other relevant articles from Wikipedia and outside of Wikipedia. If there was a way to expand on their existence on other articles then that would be very helpful but I am currently skeptical as to their place in this template if I cant find any references to them that dont source this template I may add. AnyGuy talk 2331 28 October 2022 UTCreply this bothers me too im tryna list all pharaohs so this isnt helpful for me at least canide kinda has an article it just leads to the pharaoh list where he isnt even mentioned Emmanuelbruh talk 1940 30 October 2023 UTCreply I edited the template I removed animal which doesnt even have an article and canide idk if they thought there was a dog pharaoh or something and they misspelled canid idk but I deleted them Emmanuelbruh talk 1843 26 November 2023 UTCreply Removed unnamed pharaohs.edit Is it just me or do I remember a ton of name losts in the first intermediate period specifically dynasties IX and X.

Please mention the specific changes in a change X to Y format and provide a reliable source if appropriate. Deltaspace42 talk  contribs 1634 19 December 2023 UTCreply Roman Pharaohsedit Is that really necessaryappropriate for this template I note that the Romans were added about eight months ago by a new editor currently indefinitely blocked as a sock. I recognise that by a looseish definition the Emperors were Pharaohs but not to the point that adding them all in and then adding the template to their pages is useful and i suggest that i will remove unless there is strong objection. Happy days  LindsayHello 2004 4 February 2024 UTCreply As the one who just added the templates to the pages if the consensus is to remove them from the template and subsequently from the pages I have no objection to it.

37.4 4 talk 2118 4 February 2024 UTCreply Im just going to provide a brief literature overview from the sources I have on hand for consideration. Grimal 1992 full chronology up to the Macedonian dynasty a brief note for the Ptolemaic and Roman periods Hornung Krauss  Warburton eds 2006 full chronology up to Alexander the Great Dodson  Hilton 2004 full chronology to the Ptolemaic period and a brief note for later periods Bard ed 2001 full chronology up to the Ptolemaic period Clayton 1994 no list but detailed discussion to the Ptolemaic period and a one page summary of the Roman period Shaw ed 2004 full chronology through the Roman period OEAE 2001 full chronology until the Arab Conquest I suspect any cutoff point can be justified with reference to HQRS from the Saite period to the Byzantines. Ending with the Ptolemies is the most common. Mr rnddude talk 2121 4 February 2024 UTCreply Diocletian was the last Roman emperor to be regarded as pharaoh by the surviving temple priesthoods. They continued to count the years of his reign even after his death which is why the last hieroglyphic text is dated to Year 110. Garry Shaw in The Pharaoh Life at Court and on Campaign 2012 makes the case that he was the last pharaoh. I definitely wouldnt include any emperors later than Diocletianthe other nonChristian tetrarchs dont seem to have made enough of an impact to be regarded as pharaohs. But if other editors want to remove all emperors from the template I wont object. A. Parrot talk 2302 4 February 2024 UTCreply Whether or not the emperors should be included in the template it seems inappropriate to add the template to their articles and to categorise them with CategoryRoman pharaohs as they have been since June 2021. It was at most a provincial title the way that one conquered people or priesthood reconciled Roman rule not a defining characteristic of the Roman emperors per WPDEFCAT  one that reliable sources commonly and consistently refer to in describing the topic such as the nationality of a person or the geographic location of a place. Also its strange to have a template including Roman pharaohs at the foot of our Pharaohs article as it opens with until the annexation of Egypt by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE. NebY talk 0019 5 February 2024 UTCreply I think Roman emperors shouldnt be included. It was a sort of courtesy title. T8612 talk 0854 5 February 2024 UTCreply Mythical section.edit Why is there a new section named mythical period. What does this add exactly It only lists one pharaoh which doesnt exist yes I see the name. If there was a mythical section that would be a bit better it wouldve been in the beginning which the gods and demigods would be listed in. Emmanuelbruh talk 0132 7 February 2024 UTCreply In my opinion Emmanuelbruh talk 0132 7 February 2024 UTCreply I agree. There are many pharaohs whose existence is uncertain and there is at least one Nitocris who blurs the boundary between may have been a real ruler with ambiguous support from Egyptian sources and product of Greek legend. Note that Nitocris is not included in the template. Platos Thamus is as far as I can tell Greek legend at best and may have been entirely Platos fictional construct not even based in preexisting legend. Creating a section for Thamus opens the template up to include other fictitious pharaohs with unclear inclusion criteria. I dont see the point in opening that can of worms. Ping Johnkatz1972 who added this section to the template. A. Parrot talk 1831 7 February 2024 UTCreply I think any addition of information should be positive as long as it is not misleading. Johnkatz1972 talk 0839 8 February 2024 UTCreply Elevating Thamus to the level of mythical as opposed to used once by Plato to make a point and quite possibly invented by him as mysteriously otherwise unattested even in Greek mythology let alone Egyptian and treating him as worthy of note alongside the pharaohs on whom we actually have articles andor who feature in articles on dynasties is misleading. NebY talk 2011 8 February 2024 UTCreply I agree with removing it. static shakedown   2057 8 February 2024 UTCreply We should either remove it OR we could add all the god pharaohs which although not by plato still were quite mythical. Whichever one you pick we should remind ourselves that this is for a wikipedia template which would be factual or as much as possible anyways. Emmanuelbruh talk 2145 8 February 2024 UTCreply SHOULD Emmanuelbruh talk 2215 8 February 2024 UTCreply As there hasnt been any further discussion in a couple of weeks and all but one participant supported or leaned toward removing the section Ive taken it out.
