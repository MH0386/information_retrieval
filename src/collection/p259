53 present Egypt portal v t e Prehistoric Egypt and Predynastic Egypt is the period of time starting at the first human settlement and ending at the First Dynasty of Egypt around 3100 BC. At the end of prehistory Predynastic Egypt is traditionally defined as the period from the final part of the Neolithic period beginning c. 6200 BC to the end of the Naqada III period c. 3000 BC. The dates of the Predynastic period were first defined before widespread archaeological excavation of Egypt took place and recent finds indicating very gradual Predynastic development have led to controversy over when exactly the Predynastic period ended. Thus various terms such as Protodynastic period Zero Dynasty or Dynasty 01 are used to name the part of the period which might be characterized as Predynastic by some and Early Dynastic by others. The Predynastic period is generally divided into cultural eras each named after the place where a certain type of Egyptian settlement was first discovered. However the same gradual development that characterizes the Protodynastic period is present throughout the entire Predynastic period and individual cultures must not be interpreted as separate entities but as largely subjective divisions used to facilitate study of the entire period. The vast majority of Predynastic archaeological finds have been in Upper Egypt because the silt of the Nile River was more heavily deposited at the Delta region completely burying most Delta sites long before modern times.2 Paleolithicedit Excavation of the Nile has exposed early stone tools from the last million or so years. The earliest of these lithic industries were located within a 
30 metre 100 ft terrace and were primitive Acheulean Abbevillian Chellean c. 600000 years ago and an Egyptian form of the Clactonian c. 400000 years ago. Within the 
15 metre 50 ft terrace was developed Acheulean. Originally reported as early Mousterian c. 160000 years ago but since changed to Levalloisean other implements were located in the 
10 metre 30 ft terrace. The 
4.5  and 
3 metre 1510 ft terraces saw a more developed version of the Levalloisean also initially reported as an Egyptian version of Mousterian. An Egyptian version of the Aterian technology was also located.3 The Fakhurian late Paleolithic industry in Upper Egypt showed that a homogenous population existed in the NileValley during the late Pleistocene. Studies of the skeletal material showed they were in the range of variation found in the Wadi Halfa Jebel Sahaba and fragments from the Kom Ombo populations.4 Wadi Halfaedit Aterian point from Zaccar Djelfa region Algeria. Some of the oldest known structures were discovered in Egypt by archaeologist Waldemar Chmielewski along the southern border near Wadi Halfa Sudan at the Arkin 8 site. Chmielewski dated the structures to 100000 BC.5 The remains of the structures are oval depressions about 30 cm deep and 2  1 meters across. Many are lined with flat sandstone slabs which served as tent rings supporting a domelike shelter of skins or brush. This type of dwelling provided a place to live but if necessary could be taken down easily and transported. They were mobile structureseasily disassembled moved and reassembledproviding huntergatherers with semipermanent habitation.5 Aterian industryedit Main article Aterian Aterian toolmaking reached Egypt c. 40000 BC.5 Khormusan industryedit The Khormusan industry in Egypt began between 42000 and 32000 BP.5 Khormusans developed tools not only from stone but also from animal bones and hematite.5 They also developed small arrow heads resembling those of Native Americans5 but no bows have been found.5 The end of the Khormusan industry came around 16000 B.C. with the appearance of other cultures in the region including the Gemaian.6 Late Paleolithicedit The Late Paleolithic in Egypt started around 30000 BC.5 The Nazlet Khater skeleton was found in 1980 and given an age of 33000 years in 1982 based on nine samples ranging between 35100 and 30360 years old.7 This specimen is the only complete modern human skeleton from the earliest Late Stone Age in Africa.8 Mesolithicedit Halfan and Kubbaniyan cultureedit Main article Halfan culture Map of Egypt The Halfan and Kubbaniyan two closely related industries flourished along the Upper Nile Valley. Halfan sites are found in the far north of Sudan whereas Kubbaniyan sites are found in Upper Egypt. For the Halfan only four radiocarbon dates have been produced. Schild and Wendorf 2014 discard the earliest and latest as erratic and conclude that the Halfan existed c.

Greater concentrations of artifacts indicate that they were not bound to seasonal wandering but settled for longer periods.citation needed The Halfan culture was derived in turn from the Khormusana
11 page needed which depended on specialized hunting fishing and collecting techniques for survival. The primary material remains of this culture are stone tools flakes and a multitude of rock paintings. Sebilian cultureedit Main article Sebilian In Egypt analyses of pollen found at archaeological sites indicate that the people of the Sebilian culture also known as the Esna culture were gathering wheat and barley. The Sebilian culture began around 13000 B.C and vanished around 10000 B.Ccitation needed Domesticated seeds were not found.12 It has been hypothesized that the sedentary lifestyle practiced by grain gatherers led to increased warfare which was detrimental to sedentary life and brought this period to an end.12 Qadan cultureedit Main article Qadan culture The Qadan culture 130009000 BC was a Mesolithic industry that archaeological evidence suggests originated in Upper Egypt presentday south Egypt approximately 15000 years ago.1314 The Qadan subsistence mode is estimated to have persisted for approximately 4000 years. It was characterized by hunting as well as a unique approach to food gathering that incorporated the preparation and consumption of wild grasses and grains.1314 Systematic efforts were made by the Qadan people to water care for and harvest local plant life but grains were not planted in ordered rows.15 Around twenty archaeological sites in Upper Nubia give evidence for the existence of the Qadan cultures graingrinding culture. Its makers also practiced wild grain harvesting along the Nile during the beginning of the Sahaba Daru Nile phase when desiccation in the Sahara caused residents of the Libyan oases to retreat into the Nile valley.12 Among the Qadan culture sites is the Jebel Sahaba cemetery which has been dated to the Mesolithic.16 Qadan peoples were the first to develop sickles and they also developed grinding stones independently to aid in the collecting and processing of these plant foods prior to consumption.5 However there are no indications of the use of these tools after 10000 BC when huntergatherers replaced them.5 Harifian cultureedit Main article Harifian The Harifians 8800  8000 BC are viewed as migrating out of the Fayyumb and the eastern deserts of Egypt including Sinai during the late Mesolithic to merge with the PrePottery Neolithic B PPNBb culture whose tool assemblage resembles that of the Harifian. This assimilation led to the CircumArabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex a group of cultures that invented nomadic pastoralism and may have been the original culture that spread ProtoSemitic languages across much of Southwest Asia.19 Neolithic to ProtoDynasticedit Lower Egyptedit Faiyum A cultureedit Map of Lower Egypt and location of the Faiyum oasis Continued expansion of the desert forced the early ancestors of the Egyptians to settle around the Nile more permanently and adopt a more sedentary lifestyle during the Neolithic. The period from 9000 to 6000 BC has left very little in the way of archaeological evidence. Around 6200 BC Neolithic settlements appear all over Egypt.20 Some studies based on morphological21 genetic2223242526 and archaeological data1727282930 have attributed these settlements to migrants from the Fertile Crescent in the Near East returning during the Egyptian and North African Neolithic bringing agriculture to the region. Arrowheads from Al Fayum Morphological and postcranial data has linked the earliest farming populations at Fayum Merimde and ElBadari to Near Eastern populations.313233 The archaeological data also suggests that Near Eastern domesticates were incorporated into a preexisting foraging strategy and only slowly developed into a fullblown lifestyle.c3536 Finally the names for the Near Eastern domesticates imported into Egypt were not Sumerian or ProtoSemitic loan words.3738 However some scholars have disputed this view and cited linguistic39 physical anthropological40 archaeological414243 and genetic data4445464748 which does not support the hypothesis of a mass migration from the Levantine during the prehistoric period. According to historian William Stiebling and archaeologist Susan N. Helft this view posits that the ancient Egyptians are the same original population group as Nubians and other Saharan populations with some genetic input from Arabian Levantine North African and IndoEuropean groups who have known to have settled in Egypt during its long history. On the other hand Stiebling and Helft acknowledge that the genetic studies of North African populations generally suggest a big influx of Near Eastern populations during the Neolithic Period or earlier. They also added that there have only been a few studies on ancient Egyptian DNA to clarify these issues.49 Weaving is evidenced for the first time during the Faiyum A Period. People of this period unlike later Egyptians buried their dead very close to and sometimes inside their settlements.50 Merimde culture clay head circa 5000 BC.51 This is one of the earliest known representations of a human head in Egypt. Although archaeological sites reveal very little about this time an examination of the many Egyptian words for city provides a hypothetical list of causes of Egyptian sedentarism. In Upper Egypt terminology indicates trade protection of livestock high ground for flood refuge and sacred sites for deities.52 Merimde cultureedit Main article Merimde culture From about 5000 to 4200 BC the Merimde culture so far only known from Merimde Beni Salama a large settlement site at the edge of the Western Delta flourished in Lower Egypt. The culture has strong connections to the Faiyum A culture as well as the Levant. People lived in small huts produced a simple undecorated pottery and had stone tools. Cattle sheep goats and pigs were held. Wheat sorghum and barley were planted. The Merimde people buried their dead within the settlement and produced clay figurines.53 The first lifesized Egyptian head made of clay comes from Merimde. El Omari cultureedit The El Omari culture is known from a small settlement near modern Cairo. People seem to have lived in huts but only postholes and pits survive. The pottery is undecorated. Stone tools include small flakes axes and sickles. Metal was not yet known.54 Their sites were occupied from 4000 BC to the Archaic Period 3100 BC.55 Maadi cultureedit The prisoners on the Battlefield Palette may be the people of the ButoMaadi culture subjected by the Egyptian rulers of Naqada III.56 The Maadi culture also called Buto Maadi culture is the most important Lower Egyptian prehistoric culture dated about 40003500 BC57 and contemporary with Naqada I and II phases in Upper Egypt. The culture is best known from the site Maadi near Cairo as well as the site of Buto58 but is also attested in many other places in the Delta to the Faiyum region. This culture was marked by development in architecture and technology. It also followed its predecessor cultures when it comes to undecorated ceramics.59 Ancient Egypt Predynastic Stone Vessels. Louvre Museum Paris Copper was known and some copper adzes have been found. The pottery is handmade it is simple and undecorated. Presence of blacktopped red pots indicate contact with the Naqada sites in the south. Many imported vessels from Palestine have also been found. Black basalt stone vessels were also used.57 People lived in small huts partly dug into the ground. The dead were buried in cemeteries but with few burial goods. The Maadi culture was replaced by the Naqada III culture whether this happened by conquest or infiltration is still an open question.60 The developments in Lower Egypt in the times previous to the unification of the country have been the subject of considerable disputes over the years. The recent excavations at Tell elFarkha de Sais and Tell elIswid have clarified this picture to some extent. As a result the Chalcolithic Lower Egyptian culture is now emerging as an important subject of study.61 Galleryedit Clapper discovered in Maadi Louvre Museum Carved catfish bones and jar discovered in Maadi Possible prisoners and wounded men of the ButoMaadi culture devoured by animals while one is led by a man in long dress probably an Egyptian official fragment top right corner. Battlefield Palette.5662 Upper Egyptedit Tasian cultureedit Main article Tasian culture Tasian beaker found in a Badarian grave at Qau tomb 569 around 4000 BC Upper Egypt British Museum The Tasian culture appeared around 4500 BC in Upper Egypt. This culture group is named for the burials found at Der Tasa on the east bank of the Nile between Asyut and Akhmim. The Tasian culture group is notable for producing the earliest blacktopware a type of red and brown pottery that is colored black on the top portion and interior.50 This pottery is vital to the dating of Predynastic Egypt. Because all dates for the Predynastic period are tenuous at best WMF Petrie developed a system called sequence dating by which the relative date if not the absolute date of any given Predynastic site can be ascertained by examining its pottery. As the Predynastic period progressed the handles on pottery evolved from functional to ornamental. The degree to which any given archaeological site has functional or ornamental pottery can also be used to determine the relative date of the site. Since there is little difference between Tasian ceramics and Badarian pottery the Tasian Culture overlaps the Badarian range significantly.63 From the Tasian period onward it appears that Upper Egypt was influenced strongly by the culture of Lower Egypt.64 Archaeological evidence has suggested that the Tasian and Badarian Nile Valley sites were a peripheral network of earlier African cultures that featured the movement of Badarian Saharan Nubian and Nilotic populations.65 Bruce Williams Egyptologist has argued that the Tasian culture was significantly related to the SudaneseSaharan traditions from the Neolithic era which extended from regions north of Khartoum to locations near Dongola in Sudan.66 Badarian cultureedit Main article Badarian culture Ancient Badarian mortuary figurine of a woman held at the Louvre The Badarian culture from about 4400 to 4000 BC67 is named for the Badari site near Der Tasa. It followed the Tasian culture but was so similar that many consider them one continuous period. The Badarian Culture continued to produce the kind of pottery called blacktopware albeit much improved in quality and was assigned Sequence Dating numbers 21
29.6 3 The primary difference that prevents scholars from merging the two periods is that Badarian sites use copper in addition to stone and are thus Chalcolithic settlements while the Neolithic Tasian sites are still considered Stone Age.63 Badarian flint tools continued to develop into sharper and more shapely blades and the first faience was developed.68 Distinctly Badarian sites have been located from Nekhen to a little north of Abydos.69 It appears that the Fayum A culture and the Badarian and Tasian Periods overlapped significantly however the Fayum A culture was considerably less agricultural and was still Neolithic in nature.6870 Several biological anthropological studies have shown strong biological affinities between the Badarians and other Northeast African populations.717273747576 In 2005 Keita examined Badarian crania from predynastic upper Egypt in comparison to various European and tropical African crania. He found that the predynastic Badarian series clustered much closer with the tropical African series. Although no Asian or other North African samples were included in the study as the comparative series were selected based on Brace et al.s 1993 comments on the affinities of an upper EgyptianNubian epipalaeolithic series. Keita further noted that additional analysis and material from Sudan late dynastic northern Egypt Gizeh Somalia Asia and the Pacific Islands show the Badarian series to be most similar to a series from the northeast quandrant of Africa and then to other Africans.77 Dental trait analysis of Badarian fossils conducted in a thesis study found that they were closely related to other Afroasiaticspeaking populations inhabiting Northeast Africa and the Maghreb. Among the ancient populations the Badarians were nearest to other ancient Egyptians Naqada Hierakonpolis Abydos and Kharga in Upper Egypt Hawara in Lower Egypt and CGroup and Pharaonic era skeletons excavated in Lower Nubia followed by the AGroup culture bearers of Lower Nubia the Kerma and Kush populations in Upper Nubia the Meroitic XGroup and Christian period inhabitants of Lower Nubia and the Kellis population in the Dakhla Oasis.7821920 Among the recent groups the Badari markers were morphologically closest to the Shawia and Kabyle Berber populations of Algeria as well as Bedouin groups in Morocco Libya and Tunisia followed by other Afroasiaticspeaking populations in the Horn of Africa.78222224 The Late Roman era Badarian skeletons from Kellis were also phenotypically distinct from those belonging to other populations in SubSaharan Africa.7823132 Naqada cultureedit Main article Naqada culture Evolution of Egyptian prehistoric pottery styles from Naqada I to Naqada II and Naqada III The Naqada culture is an archaeological culture of Chalcolithic Predynastic Egypt c. 40003000 BC named for the town of Naqada Qena Governorate. It is divided in three subperiods Naqada I II and III. A number of biological anthropological studies have found Naqada skeletal remains to have clear Northeast African affinities.798081828384 In 1996 Lovell and Prowse also reported the presence of individuals buried at Naqada in what they interpreted to be elite high status tombs showing them to be an endogamous ruling or elite segment of the local population at Naqada which is more closely related to populations in northern Nubia than to neighbouring populations in southern Egypt. Specifically they stated the Naqda samples were more similar to the Lower Nubian protodynastic sample than they are to the geographically more proximate Egyptian samples in Qena and Badari. However they found the skeletal samples from the Naqada cemeteries to be significantly different to protodynastic populations in northern Nubia and predynastic Egyptian samples from Badari and Qena which were also significantly different to northern Nubian populations.85 Overall both the elite and nonelite individuals in the Naqada cemeteries were more similar to each other than they were to the samples in northern Nubia or to samples from Badari and Qena in southern Egypt. 86 In 2023 Christopher Ehret reported that the physical anthropological findings from the major burial sites of those founding locales of ancient Egypt in the fourth millennium BCE notably ElBadari as well as Naqada show no demographic indebtedness to the Levant. Ehret specified that these studies revealed cranial and dental affinities with closest parallels to other longtime populations in the surrounding areas of northeastern Africa such as Nubia and the northern Horn of Africa. He further commented that the Naqada and Badarian populations did not migrate from somewhere else but were descendants of the longterm inhabitants of these portions of Africa going back many millennia. Ehret also cited existing archaeological linguistic and genetic data which he argued supported the demographic history.87 Amratian culture Naqada Iedit Main article Amratian culture Ovoid Naqada I Amratian blacktopped terracotta vase c. 38003500 BC. The Amratian culture lasted from about 4000 to 3500 BC.67 It is named after the site of ElAmra about 120 km south of Badari. ElAmra is the first site where this culture group was found unmingled with the later Gerzean culture group but this period is better attested at the Naqada site so it also is referred to as the Naqada I culture.68 Blacktopped ware continues to appear but white crossline ware a type of pottery which has been decorated with close parallel white lines being crossed by another set of close parallel white lines is also found at this time. The Amratian period falls between S.D. 30 and 39 in Petries Sequence Dating system.88 Newly excavated objects attest to increased trade between Upper and Lower Egypt at this time. A stone vase from the north was found at elAmra and copper which is not mined in Egypt was imported from the Sinai or possibly Nubia. Obsidian89 and a small amount of gold88 were both definitely imported from Nubia. Trade with the oases also was likely.89 New innovations appeared in Amratian settlements as precursors to later cultural periods. For example the mudbrick buildings for which the Gerzean period is known were first seen in Amratian times but only in small numbers.90 Additionally oval and theriomorphic cosmetic palettes appear in this period but the workmanship is very rudimentary and the relief artwork for which they were later known is not yet present.91
92 full citation needed Gerzean culture Naqada IIedit Main article Gerzean culture A typical Naqada II pot with ship theme The Gerzean culture from about 3500 to 3200 BC67 is named after the site of Gerzeh. It was the next stage in Egyptian cultural development and it was during this time that the foundation of Dynastic Egypt was laid. Gerzean culture is largely an unbroken development out of Amratian Culture starting in the delta and moving south through upper Egypt but failing to dislodge Amratian culture in Nubia.93 Gerzean pottery is assigned values from S.D. 40 through 62 and is distinctly different from Amratian white crosslined wares or blacktopped ware.88 Gerzean pottery was painted mostly in dark red with pictures of animals people and ships as well as geometric symbols that appear derived from animals.93 Also wavy handles rare before this period though occasionally found as early as S.D. 35 became more common and more elaborate until they were almost completely ornamental.88 Gerzean culture coincided with a significant decline in rainfall94 and farming along the Nile now produced the vast majority of food93 though contemporary paintings indicate that hunting was not entirely forgone. With increased food supplies Egyptians adopted a much more sedentary lifestyle and cities grew as large as 50
00.9 3 It was in this time that Egyptian city dwellers stopped building with reeds and began massproducing mud bricks first found in the Amratian Period to build their cities.93 Egyptian stone tools while still in use moved from bifacial construction to rippleflaked construction. Copper was used for all kinds of tools93 and the first copper weaponry appears here.69 Silver gold lapis and faience were used ornamentally93 and the grinding palettes used for eyepaint since the Badarian period began to be adorned with relief carvings.69 Gebel elArak knife 33003200 BC Egyptian prehistoric Gebel elArak Knife Abydos Egypt. Louvre Museum.95 Mesopotamian king as Master of Animals on the Gebel elArak Knife. This work of art both shows the influence of Mesopotamia on Egypt at an early date during a period of EgyptMesopotamia relations and the state of Mesopotamian royal iconography during the Uruk period.9596 The first tombs in classic Egyptian style were also built modeled after ordinary houses and sometimes composed of multiple rooms.89 Although further excavations in the Delta are needed this style is generally believed to originate there and not in Upper Egypt.89 Although the Gerzean Culture is now clearly identified as being the continuation of the Amratian period significant Mesopotamian influence worked its way into Egypt during the Gerzean interpreted in previous years as evidence of a Mesopotamian ruling class the socalled dynastic race coming to power over Upper Egypt. This idea no longer attracts academic support. Distinctly foreign objects and art forms entered Egypt during this period indicating contacts with several parts of Asia. Objects such as the Gebel elArak knife handle which has patently Mesopotamian relief carvings on it have been found in Egypt97 and the silver which appears in this period can only have been obtained from Asia Minor.93 Naqada figure of a woman interpreted to represent the goddess Bat with her inward curving horns.

Protodynastic Period Naqada IIIedit Main article Naqada III Bull palette Naqada III The Naqada III period from about 3200 to 3000 BC67 is generally taken to be identical with the Protodynastic period during which Egypt was unified. Naqada III is notable for being the first era with hieroglyphs though this is disputed by some the first regular use of serekhs the first irrigation and the first appearance of royal cemeteries.102 The relatively affluent Maadi suburb of Cairo is built over the original Naqada stronghold.103 Bioarchaeologist Nancy Lovell had stated that there is a sufficient body of morphological evidence to indicate that ancient southern Egyptians had physical characteristics within the range of variation of both ancient and modern indigenous peoples in the Sahara and tropical Africa. She summarised that In general the inhabitants of Upper Egypt and Nubia had the greatest biological affinity to people of the Sahara and more southerly areas104 but exhibited local variation in an African context.105 The Scorpion Macehead Ashmolean Museum.

5.9  kiloyear event Prehistoric North Africa Notesedit  The Khormusan is defined as a Middle Palaeolithic industry while the Halfan is defined as an Epipalaeolithic industry. According to scholarly opinion the Khormusan and the Halfan are viewed as separate and distinct cultures.10  a b According to scholarly opinion the Harifian culture is derived from the Natufian culture in which the only characteristic that distinguishes it from the Natufian is the Harif point. It is viewed as an adaptation of Natufian hunter gatherers to the Negev and Sinai.17 The Harifian are thought to have lasted only about three hundred years then vanishing followed by a thousand year hiatus during which the Negev and Sinai regions were uninhabitable.17 Since the Harifian culture ended c. 12000 BP18 there could be no possible connection with the PPNB which began c. 10500 BP.  Settler colonists from the Near East would most likely have merged with the indigenous cultures resulting in a mixed economy with the agricultural aspect of the economy increasing in frequency through time which is what the archaeological record more precisely indicates. Both pottery lithics and economy with Near Eastern characteristics and lithics with North African characteristics are present in the Fayum A culture.34 Referencesedit  Leprohon Ronald J. 2013.

There is now a sufficient body of evidence from modern studies of skeletal remains to indicate that the ancient Egyptians especially southern Egyptians exhibited physical characteristics that are within the range of variation for ancient and modern indigenous peoples of the Sahara and tropical Africa. The distribution of population characteristics seems to follow a clinal pattern from south to north which may be explained by natural selection as well as gene flow between neighboring populations. In general the inhabitants of Upper Egypt and Nubia had the greatest biological affinity to people of the Sahara and more southerly areas. Lovell Nancy C. 1999. Egyptians physical anthropology of.
