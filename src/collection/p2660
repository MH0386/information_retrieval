25 th century BC also known as Raneferef Ranefer and in Greek as  Chers was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period. He was most likely the eldest son of pharaoh Neferirkare Kakai and queen Khentkaus II. He was known as prince Ranefer before he ascended to the throne. Neferefre started a pyramid for himself in the royal necropolis of Abusir called Netjeribau Raneferef which means The bas of Neferefre are divine. The pyramid was never finished with a masons inscription showing that works on the stone structure were abandoned during or shortly after the kings second year of reign. Together with the sparsity of attestations contemporaneous with his reign this is taken by Egyptologists as evidence that Neferefre died unexpectedly after two to three years on the throne. Neferefre was nonetheless buried in his pyramid hastily completed in the form of a mastaba by his second successor and presumably younger brother pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. Fragments of his mummy were uncovered there showing that he died in his early twenties. Little is known of Neferefres activities beyond laying the foundations of his pyramid and attempting to finish that of his father. A single text shows that Neferefre had planned or just started to build a sun temple called HotepRe meaning Ra is content or Ras offering table which possibly never functioned as such given the brevity of the kings reign. After his death Neferefre might have been succeeded by an ephemeral and littleknown pharaoh Shepseskare whose relation with Neferefre remains highly uncertain and debated. Sourcesedit Contemporaneousedit There are very few archaeological sources contemporaneous with Neferefre a fact which is now seen by Egyptologists including Miroslav Verner to imply a very short reign.22 Verner knew of only one inscription dated to his rule. It was left by the builders of his pyramid on a corner block at the end of the corridor leading to the pyramid substructures.23 The inscription was written on the fourth day of the Akhet season in the year of first occurrence of the cattle count an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom24 although recent reappraisals have led Egyptologists to posit a less regular and somewhat more frequent count.25 Therefore the inscription must refer to Neferefres first or second year on the throne and his third year at the very latest.note 326 Finally a few artefacts dated to Neferefres rule or shortly after have been uncovered in his mortuary complex and elsewhere in Abusirnote 4 such as clay seals bearing his Horus name.28 Some of the Abusir Papyri discovered in Khentkhaus IIs temple and dating to the mid to late Fifth Dynasty mention the mortuary temple and funerary cult of Neferefre. They constitute a written source nearcontemporaneous with his reign which not only confirmed the existence of Neferefres pyramid complex at a time when it had not yet been identified29 but also gives details regarding the administrative organisation and importance of the funerary cult of the king in Ancient Egyptian society.30 Historicaledit Cartouche of Neferefre on the Abydos king list Neferefre is present on several Ancient Egyptian king lists all dating to the New Kingdom period. The earliest such list mentioning Neferefre is the Abydos King List written during the reign of Seti I fl. 12901279 BC and where his prenomen occupies the 
29 th entry between those of Neferirkare Kakai and Nyuserre Ini.31 During the subsequent reign of Ramses II fl. 12791213 BC Neferefre appears on the Saqqara Tablet32 this time after Shepseskare that is as a second successor to Neferirkare Kakai. Owing to a scribal error Neferefres name on this list is given as Khanefere or Neferkhare.33 Neferefres prenomen was in all probability also given on the Turin canon third column 
21 st row which dates to the same period as the Saqqara tablet but it has since been lost in a large lacuna affecting the document. Nonetheless the part of the reign length attributed to Neferefre by the canon is still legible with a single stroke sign indicating one year of reign to which a decade could in principle be added as the corresponding sign would be effectively lost in the lacuna of the document.23 Neferefre was also likely mentioned in the Aegyptiaca a history of Egypt written in the 
3 rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II 283246 BC by the Egyptian priest Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. Africanus relates that the Aegyptiaca mentioned the succession Neferchers  Sisirs  Chers for the midFifth Dynasty. Neferchers Sisirs and Chers are believed to be the hellenized forms for Neferirkare Shepseskare and Neferkhare that is Neferefre respectively. Thus Manethos reconstruction of the Fifth Dynasty is in good agreement with the Saqqara tablet.31 In Africanus epitome of the Aegyptiaca Chers is reported to have reigned for 20 years.34 Familyedit Parents and siblingsedit Menkauhor Kaiu could be a son of Neferefre and Khentkaus III. Neferefre was in all likelihood the eldest son of his predecessor pharaoh Neferirkare Kakai with queen Khentkaus II.3535 This is shown by a relief on a limestone slab discovered in a house in the village near Abusir36 and depicting Neferirkare and his wife Khentkaus with the kings eldest son Ranefernote 537 a name identical with some variants of Neferefres own.38 This indicates that Ranefer was Neferefres name when he was still only a crown prince that is before his accession to the throne.39 Neferirkare and Khentkaus had at least another son the future king Nyuserre Ini. In addition since the relation between Shepseskare and Neferefre remains uncertain it is possible that the two were brothers too as suggested by the Egyptologist Silke Roth40 although other hypotheses on the matter have been proposed Verner sees Shepseskare as a son of Sahure and hence Neferefres uncle while Jaromr Krej believes Shepseskare was Neferefres son.41 Finally yet another brother42 possibly younger43 than both Neferefre and Nyuserre has also been proposed Iryenre a prince irypatnote 6 whose filiation is suggested by the fact that his funerary cult was associated with that of his mother both having taken place in the temple of Khentkaus II.4546 Consort and childrenedit Until 2014 no consort of Neferefre was known.4147 Late in that year the mastaba of Khentkaus III was discovered by archaeologists from the Czech Institute of Egyptology working in Abusir south east of Neferefres pyramid.484950 The location and date of the tomb as well as inscriptions found in it strongly suggest that Khentkaus III was Neferefres queen.51 Indeed not only was Khentkaus III presumably buried during the few decades following Neferefres reign but her mastaba is also in close proximity to his pyramidnote 7 and she bore the title of kings wife proving that she was a queen.48 In addition Khentkaus III was also called kings mother by inscriptions in her tomb indicating that her son had become pharaoh. Since Neferefres second successor Nyuserre Ini is known to have been his brother rather than his son and since Khentkaus III might have been buried during Nyuserres reign as indicated by mud seals48 this only leaves either Neferefres ephemeral successor Shepseskare or Nyuserres successor Menkauhor Kaiu as possibilities.48 There is an ongoing debate in Egyptology concerning these two alternatives. Verner posits that Shepseskare was an uncle of Neferefre and therefore that Menkauhor Kaiu was Neferefres son. Meanwhile Krej views the opposite hypothesis that Shepseskare was Neferefres son with Khentkaus III as more probable.41 Two further sons of Neferefre and Khentkaus III have been proposed by Verner the kings son Nakhtsare54 whose filiation is supported by the general date and location of his tomb41 and Kakaibaef a member of the elite buried in Abusir.54 Krej notes the lack of the titular kings son in relation to Kakaibaef thereby emphasizing the conjectural nature of Verners assertion.41 Reignedit Accession to the throneedit Drawing of the impression of a cylinder seal of Shepseskare Two competing hypotheses exist in Egyptology to describe the succession of events running from the death of Neferirkare Kakai third king of the Fifth Dynasty to the coronation of Nyuserre Ini sixth ruler of the dynasty. Relying on historical sources most notably the Saqqara king list and Manethos Aegyptiaca where Neferefre is said to have succeeded Shepseskare34 many Egyptologists such as Jrgen von Beckerath and Hartwig Altenmller have traditionally believed55 that the following royal succession took place Neferirkare Kakai  Shepseskare  Neferefre Isi  Nyuserre Ini.556 In this scenario Neferefre would be the father of Nyuserre who would have become pharaoh after the formers unexpected death.557 This view was challenged at the turn of the millennium most notably by Verner585960 who has been responsible for the archaeological excavations of the Fifth Dynasty royal necropolis of Abusir since 1976. Firstly there is the relief mentioned earlier showing that Neferefre was in all likelihood Neferirkares eldest son.3961 Secondly excavations of Neferefres pyramid have yielded his mummy which showed that he was 18 to 20 years of age at the death of Neferirkare.62 Consequently as the previous kings eldest son in his late teens to early twenties Neferefre was in optimal position to ascend the throne. Positing that Shepseskare reigned between Neferefre and his father would thus require an explanation as to why and how Shepseskares claim to the throne could have been stronger than Neferefres.63 Map of the necropolis of Abusir.64 The unfinished pyramid is attributed to Shepseskare.65 The red line points to Heliopolis.66 Thirdly archaeological evidences indicate that Shepseskare most likely reigned for only a few weeks to a few months at the most rather than seven years as credited to him in the Aegyptiaca1355 a hypothesis already supported by Nicolas Grimal as early as 19
88.6 7 Indeed Shepseskare is the least known Fifth Dynasty king with only two seals6869 and a few seal impressions bearing his name known as of 201770717273 a paucity of attestations suggesting a very short reign. This is also supported by the state of Shepseskares unfinished pyramid which was interrupted and corresponds to the work of several weeks perhaps no more than one or two months.74 Fourthly archaeological evidence also favors dating Shepseskares reign to after Neferefres.75 Some of the few seal impressions bearing Shepseskares name have been discovered in the oldest part of Neferefres mortuary temple76 which was not built until Neferefres death.77 This seems to indicate that Shepseskare made offerings for the funerary cult of Neferefre who must therefore have reigned before him.7778 Another argument concerns the alignment of pyramids of Sahure Neferirkare Kakai and Neferefre they form a line pointing to Heliopolis just as the three pyramids of Giza do.note 866 In contrast Shepseskares unfinished pyramid does not fall on the line to Heliopolis which strongly suggests that Neferefres pyramid had already been in place when Shepseskare started to build his.79 Lastly while Shepseskare is noted as the immediate predecessor of Neferefre in the Saqqara king list Verner notes that this slight discrepancy can be attributed to the political disorders of the time and its dynastic disputes.78 Verners arguments have convinced a number of Egyptologists including Darrell Baker Erik Hornung and Iorwerth Edwards.135580 Reign durationedit Schist6 statue of Neferefre wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt discovered in his pyramid complex at Abusir Egyptian Museum81 While Neferefre is given a reign of some 20 years in epitomes of Manethos Aegyptiaca34 the current academic view is that this number is an overestimation of his true reign length which must have been significantly shorter. Before the results of the extensive excavations in Abusir were fully published Egyptologists following the traditional succession hypothesis credited Neferefre with around a decade of rule based on the paucity of attestations contemporaneous with his reign. For example von Beckerath and Winfried Barta gave him 11 and 10 years on the throne respectively.8283 This view now has few supporters.33 Indeed since then Verner has set forth the hypothesis of a reign of no more than two years.23 His conclusion is based on archaeological evidence the unfinished state of his intended pyramid and the general paucity of documents datable to his rule. Verner writes that The shape of the tomb of Neferefra...as well as a number of other archaeological finds clearly indicate that the construction of the kings funerary monument was interrupted owing to the unexpected early death of the king. The plan of the unfinished building had to be basically changed and a decision was taken to hastily convert the unfinished pyramid of which only the incomplete lowest step of the core was built into a squareshaped mastaba or more precisely a stylized primeval hill. At the moment of the kings death neither the burial apartment was built nor was the foundation of the mortuary temple laid.23 Furthermore two historical sources conform with the hypothesis of a short reign the masons inscription in Neferefres pyramid was discovered at about two thirds of the height of the extant core of the monument23 and probably refers to Neferefres first or second year on the throne and the Turin canon which credits Neferefre with less than two full years of reign.23 The combination of archaeological and historical evidence led to the consensus that Neferefres reign lasted not longer than about two years.23 Building activitiesedit Pyramid complexedit Main article Pyramid of Neferefre Structure of the first step of Neferefres pyramid. A External wall B Internal wall C Stepping fill D Pit for the underground chambers E Pit for entry. Pyramidedit Neferefre started the construction of a pyramid for himself in the royal necropolis of Abusir where his father and grandfather had built their own pyramids. It was known to the Ancient Egyptians as Netjeribau Raneferef meaning The bas of Neferefre are divine.note 984 Planned with a square base of 108 m 354 ft the pyramid of Neferefre was to be larger than those of Userkaf and Sahure but smaller than that of his father Neferirkare.85 Upon the unexpected death of Neferefre only its lower courses had been completed9 reaching a height of c. 7 m 23 ft.86 Subsequently Nyuserre hastily completed the monument by filling its central part with poor quality limestone mortar and sand.87 The external walls of the building were given a smooth and nearly vertical covering of gray limestone at an angle of 78 with the ground so as to give it the form of a mastaba albeit with a square plan rather than with the usual rectangular shape.88 Finally the roof terrace was covered with clay into which local desert gravels were pressed giving it the appearance of a mound in the surrounding desert88 and indeed it was by the name the Moundnote 10 that the monument was subsequently called by the Ancient Egyptians.90 Verner has proposed that the monument was completed this way so as to give it the form of the primeval mound the mound that arose from the primordial waters Nu in the creation myth of the Heliopolitan form of Ancient Egyptian religion.89 The monument was used as a stone quarry from the New Kingdom period onwards90 but was later preserved from further damages as its appearance of a rough unfinished and abandoned pyramid did not attract the attention of tomb robbers.88 Mortuary templeedit Works on the mortuary temple in which the funerary cult of the deceased king was to take place had not even started when Neferefe died. In the short 
70 day period allowed between a kings death and his burial91 Neferefres successorpossibly the ephemeral Shepseskare
55 built a small limestone chapel. It was located on the pyramid base platform in the 5 m 16 ft gap left between the masonry and the platform edge where the pyramid casing would have been put in the original plans.91 This small chapel was completed during Nyuserres reign.92 This pharaoh also built a larger mortuary temple for his brother Neferefre extending over the whole 65 m 213 ft length of the pyramid side but built of cheaper mudbrick.93 The ruins of the mortuary temple of Neferefre The temple entrance comprised a courtyard adorned with two stone and 24 wooden columns.92 Behind was the earliest hypostyle hall of Ancient Egypt the remains of which can still be detected its roof supported by wooden columns in the shape of lotusclusters resting on limestone bases.80 This hall was possibly inspired by the royal palaces of the time.9495 The structure housed a large wooden statue of the king as well as statues of prisoners of war.92 Storage rooms for the offerings were located to the north of the hall. In these rooms several statues of Neferefre were discovered including six heads of the kings80 making Neferefre the Fifth Dynasty king with the most surviving statues.96 East of the main hall was the Sanctuary of the Knife which served as a slaughterhouse for the rituals. Two narrow rooms on either sides of the central altar in front of the false door in the main hall may have housed 30 m 98 ft long80 solar boats similar to Khufus.91 A significant cache of administrative papyri comparable in size to the Abusir Papyri found in the temples of Neferirkare and Khentkaus II97 was discovered in a storeroom of the mortuary temple of Neferere during a 1982 University of Prague Egyptological Institute excavation.67 The presence of this cache is due to the peculiar historical circumstances of the midFifth Dynasty.97 As both Neferirkare and Neferefre died before their pyramid complexes could be finished Nyuserre altered their planned layout diverting the causeway leading to Neferirkares pyramid to his own. This meant that Neferefres and Neferirkares mortuary complexes became somewhat isolated on the Abusir plateau. Their priests therefore had to live next to the temple premises in makeshift dwellings98 and they stored the administrative records onsite.97 In contrast the records of other temples were kept in the pyramid town close to Sahures or Nyuserres pyramid where the current level of ground water means any papyrus has long since disappeared.99 Mummy of Neferefreedit Fragments of mummy wrappings and cartonnage as well as scattered pieces of human remains were discovered on the east side of the burial chamber of the pyramid.100 The remains amounted to a left hand a left clavicle still covered with skin fragments of skin probably from the forehead upper eyelid and the left foot and a few bones.101 These remains were in the same archaeological layer as broken pieces from a red granite sarcophagus100 as well as what remained of the funerary equipment of the kingnote 11 hinting that they could indeed belong to Neferefre.15 This was further corroborated by subsequent studies of the embalming techniques used on the mummy found to be compatible with an Old Kingdom date.15 The body of the king was probably dried by means of natron and then covered with a thin layer of resin before being given a white calcareous coating. There is no evidence of brain removal as expected from postOld Kingdom mummification techniques.15 A final confirmation of the identity of the mummy is provided by radiocarbon dating which yielded a 26282393 BC interval for the human remains in close correspondence with estimated dates for the Fifth Dynasty.102 Thus Neferefre is with Djedkare Isesi one of the very few Old Kingdom pharaohs whose mummy has been identified.62 A bioarchaeological analysis of Neferefres remains revealed that the king did not partake in strenuous work15 died in his early twenties at between 20 and 23 years old and that he may have stood 
1.6 7 to 
1.6 9 m 5 ft 6 in to 5 ft 7 in in height.103 The remains of a second individual were discovered in the burial chamber but those proved to belong to an individual from the Late Middle Ages who likely lived during the 
14 th century AD. He had simply been laid on rags and covered with sand for his burial.15 Sun templeedit The Mastaba of Ti where the only attestations of the HotepRe have been found Following a tradition established by Userkaf founder of the Fifth Dynasty Neferefre planned or built a temple to the sun god Ra. Called HotepRenote 12 by the Ancient Egyptians meaning Ra is content5 or Ras offering table104 the temple has not yet been located but is presumably in the vicinity of Neferefres pyramid in Abusir.5 It is known solely105106 from inscriptions discovered in the mastaba of Ti in North Saqqara107108 where it is mentioned four times.105 Ti served as an administration official in the pyramid and sun temples of Sahure Neferirkare and Nyuserre.108109 Given Neferefres very short reign the lack of attestations of the HotepRe beyond the mastaba of Ti as well as the lack of priests having served in the temple Verner proposes that the temple might never have been completed and therefore never functioned as such. Rather it might have been integrated to or its materials reused for the Shesepibre the sun temple built by Neferefres probable younger brother Nyuserre.110 Incidentally an earlier discovery by the German archaeological expedition of 1905 under the direction of Friedrich Wilhelm von Bissing may vindicate Verners theory. This expedition uncovered the ruins of large buildings of mudbricks beneath the sun temple of Nyuserre in Abu Gorab.111 It is possible that these represent the remains of the sun temple of Neferefre although in the absence of inscriptions confirming this identification it remains conjectural.106 Pyramid of Neferirkare Kakaiedit The pyramid of Neferirkare in Abusir Main article Pyramid of Neferirkare When he ascended the throne Neferefre faced the task of completing the pyramid of his father which with a square base side of 105 m 344 ft and a height of 72 m 236 ft is the largest built during the Fifth Dynasty.112 Although well underway at the death of Neferirkare the pyramid was lacking its external limestone cladding and the accompanying mortuary temple still had to be built. Neferefre thus started to cover the pyramid surface with limestone and build the foundation of a stone temple on the pyramids eastern side. His plans were cut short by his death and the duty of finishing the monument fell on Nyuserres shoulders who abandoned the task of covering the pyramid face and instead concentrated on building the mortuary temple in bricks and wood.113 Funerary cultedit Like other pharaohs of the Old Kingdom period Neferefre benefited from a funerary cult established at his death. Some details of this cult as it occurred during the Fifth Dynasty have survived in the Abusir Papyri. A 
10 day yearly festival was held in honor of the deceased ruler during which on at least one occasion no less than 130 bulls were sacrificed in the slaughter house of his mortuary temple.30 The act of mass animal sacrifice testifies to the importance that royal funerary cults had in Ancient Egyptian society and also shows that vast agricultural resources were devoted to an activity judged unproductive by Verner something they propose possibly contributed to the decline of the Old Kingdom.30 The main beneficiaries of these sacrifices were the cults priests who consumed the offerings after the required ceremonies.30 The funerary cult of Neferefre seems to have ceased at the end of the Old Kingdom or during the First Intermediate Period.114 Traces of a possible revival of the cult during the later Middle Kingdom are scant and ambiguous. During the Twelfth Dynasty a certain Khuyankh was buried in the funerary temple of Neferefre. It remains unclear if this was to associate himself closely with the deceased ruler or because other cultic activities in the area constrained the choice of location for Khuyankhs tomb.115 Notes references and sourcesedit Notesedit  Proposed dates for Neferefres reign 24752474 BC3456 24602455 BC7 24602453 BC8 24482445 BC910 24562445 BC11 24312420 BC12 2404 BC13 2399 BC.14 Finally the radiocarbon dating of a skin fragment from the mummy of Neferefre has yielded the dates 26282393 BC.15  Uncertain translation might be a diminutive.1620  The inscription reads rnpt sp tpy
