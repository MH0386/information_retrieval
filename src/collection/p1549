21 st Dynasty or Dynasty 21 is usually classified as the first Dynasty of the Ancient Egyptian Third Intermediate Period lasting from 1077 BC to 943 BC. Historyedit After the reign of Ramesses III a long slow decline of royal power in Egypt followed. The pharaohs of the Twentyfirst Dynasty ruled from Tanis but were mostly active only in Lower Egypt which they controlled. This dynasty is described as Tanite because its political capital was based at Tanis. Meanwhile the High Priests of Amun at Thebes effectively ruled Middle and Upper Egypt in all but name. The later Egyptian Priest Manetho of Sebennytos states in his Epitome on Egyptian royal history that the 
21 st Dynasty of Egypt lasted for 130 years.1 Pharaohs of the
