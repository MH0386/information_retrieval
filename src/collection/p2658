He reigned for about 13 years in the early 
25 th century BC during the Old Kingdom Period. Sahures reign marks the political and cultural high point of the Fifth Dynasty.28 He was probably the son of his predecessor Userkaf with Queen Neferhetepes II and was in turn succeeded by his son Neferirkare Kakai. During Sahures rule Egypt had important trade relations with the Levantine coast. Sahure launched several naval expeditions to modernday Lebanon to procure cedar trees slaves and exotic items. His reign may have witnessed the flourishing of the Egyptian navy which included a highseas fleet as well as specialized racing boats. Relying on this Sahure ordered the earliest attested expedition to the land of Punt which brought back large quantities of myrrh malachite and electrum. Sahure is shown celebrating the success of this venture in a relief from his mortuary temple which shows him tending a myrrh tree in the garden of his palace named Sahures splendor soars up to heaven. This relief is the only one in Egyptian art depicting a king gardening. Sahure sent further expeditions to the turquoise and copper mines in Sinai. He also ordered military campaigns against Libyan chieftains in the Western Desert bringing back livestock to Egypt. Sahure had a pyramid built for himself in Abusir thereby abandoning the royal necropolises of Saqqara and Giza where his predecessors had built their monuments. This decision was possibly motivated by the presence of the sun temple of Userkaf in Abusir the first such temple of the Fifth Dynasty. The Pyramid of Sahure is much smaller than the pyramids of the preceding Fourth Dynasty but the decoration and architecture of his mortuary temple is more elaborate. The valley temple causeway and mortuary temple of his pyramid complex were once adorned by over 10000 m2 110000 sq ft of exquisite polychrome reliefs representing the highest form reached by this art during the Old Kingdom period. The Ancient Egyptians recognized this particular artistic achievement and tried to emulate the reliefs in the tombs of subsequent kings and queens. The architects of Sahures pyramid complex introduced the use of palmiform columns columns whose capital has the form of palm leaves which would soon become a hallmark of ancient Egyptian architecture. The layout of his mortuary temple was also innovative and became the architectural standard for the remainder of the Old Kingdom period. Sahure is also known to have constructed a sun temple called The Field of Ra and although it is yet to be located it is presumably also in Abusir. Sahure was the object of a funerary cult the food offerings for which were initially provided by agricultural estates set up during his reign. This official statesponsored cult endured until the end of the Old Kingdom. Subsequently during the Middle Kingdom period Sahure was venerated as a royal ancestor figure but his cult no longer had dedicated priests. During the New Kingdom Sahure was equated with a form of the goddess Sekhmet for unknown reasons. The cult of Sekhmet of Sahure had priests and attracted visitors from all over Egypt to Sahures temple. This unusual cult which was celebrated well beyond Abusir persisted up until the end of the Ptolemaic period nearly 2500 years after Sahures death. Familyedit Parentageedit The Westcar Papyrus dating to the Seventeenth Dynasty but probably first written during the Twelfth Dynasty tells the myth of the origins of the Fifth Dynasty. Excavations at the pyramid of Sahure in Abusir under the direction of Miroslav Verner and Tarek ElAwady in the early 20
00 s provide a picture of the royal family of the early Fifth Dynasty. In particular reliefs from the causeway linking the valley and mortuary temples of the pyramid complex reveal that Sahures mother was queen Neferhetepes II.29 She was the wife of pharaoh Userkaf as indicated by the location of her pyramid immediately adjacent to that of Userkaf30 and bore the title of kings mother.note 231 This makes Userkaf the father of Sahure in all likelihood. This is further reinforced by the discovery of Sahures cartouche in the mortuary temple of Userkaf at Saqqara indicating that Sahure finished the structure started most probably by his father.30 This contradicts older alternative theories according to which Sahure was the son of queen Khentkaus I32 believed to be the wife of the last pharaoh of the preceding Fourth Dynasty Shepseskaf and a brother to either Userkaf or Neferirkare.note 335 Sahures figure towering next to those of his sons including Netjerirenre Khakare and Neferirkare Kakai on a relief from his mortuary temple36 Childrenedit Sahure is known to have been succeeded by Neferirkare Kakainote 4 who until 2005 was believed to be his brother.37 That year a relief originally adorning the causeway of Sahures pyramid and showing Sahure seated in front of two of his sons Ranefer and Netjerirenre38 was discovered by Verner and another Egyptologist Tarek ElAwady.39 Next to Ranefers name the text Neferirkare Kakai king of Upper and Lower Egypt had been added indicating that Ranefer was Sahures son and had assumed the throne under the name Neferirkare Kakai at the death of his father.29 Since both Ranefer and Netjerirenre are given the titles of kings eldest son Verner and ElAwady speculate that they may have been twins with Ranefer born first. They propose that Netjerirenre may have later seized the throne for a brief reign under the name Shepseskare although this remains conjectural.40 The same relief further depicts queen Meretnebty41 who was thus most likely Sahures consort42 and the mother of Ranefer and Netjerirenre.39 Three more sons Khakare43 Horemsaf44 and Nebankhre45 are shown on reliefs from Sahures mortuary temple but the identity of their mothers is unknown.24 Netjerirenre bore several religious titles corresponding to highranking positions in the court and which suggest that he may have acted as a vizier for his father.46 This is debated as Michel Baud points out that at the time of Sahure the eviction of royal princes from the vizierate was ongoing if not already complete.47 Reignedit Chronologyedit Cartouche of Sahure on the Abydos king list Relative chronologyedit The relative chronology of Sahures reign is well established by historical records contemporary artifacts and archeological evidence which agree that he succeeded Userkaf and was in turn succeeded by Neferirkare Kakai.48 An historical source supporting this order of succession is the Aegyptiaca  a history of Egypt written in the 
3 rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II 283246 BC by Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. According to the Byzantine scholar George Syncellus Africanus wrote that the Aegyptiaca mentioned the succession Userchers  Sephrs  Neferchers at the start of the Fifth Dynasty. Userchers Sephrs in Greek  and Neferchers are believed to be the Hellenized forms for Userkaf Sahure and Neferirkare respectively.49 Manethos reconstruction of the early Fifth Dynasty is in agreement with those given on two more historical sources the Abydos king list where Sahures cartouche is on the 
27 th entry and the Saqqara Tablet where Sahures name is given on the 
33 rd entry. These lists of kings were written during the reigns of Seti I and Ramses II respectively.50 Reign lengthedit The Turin canon a king list written during the Nineteenth Dynasty in the early Ramesside era 12921189 BC credits him with a reign of twelve years five months and twelve days. In contrast the near contemporary royal annal of the Fifth Dynasty known as the Palermo Stone records his second third fifth and sixth years on the throne as well as his final 
13 th or 
14 th year of reignnote 5 and even records the day of his death as the 
28 th of Shemu I which corresponds to the end of the ninth month.5556 Taken together these pieces of information indicate that the royal annal of the Fifth Dynasty recorded a reign of 13 years 5 months and 12 days for Sahure only one year more than given by the Turin Canon and close to the 13 years figure given in Manethos Aegyptiaca.49 Sahure appears in two further historical records on the third entry of the Karnak king list which was made during the reign of Thutmose III 14791425 BC and on the 
26 th entry of the Saqqara Tablet dating to the reign of Ramses II 12791213 BC.12 Neither of these sources give his reign length. The absolute dates of Sahures reign are uncertain but most scholars date it to the first half of the 
25 th century BC see note 1 for details.12 Foreign activitiesedit Trade and tributeedit Relief of Sahure from the Wadi Maghareh5758 Historical records and surviving artifacts suggest that contacts with foreign lands were numerous during Sahures reign. Furthermore these contacts seem to have been mostly economic rather than military in nature. Reliefs from his pyramid complex show the return of a naval expedition to Lebanon the boats laden with the trunks of precious cedar trees.27 Other ships are represented loaded with Asiaticsnote 6 both adults and children who were either slaves91259 or merchants60 greeting Sahure Hail to thee O Sahure God of the living we behold thy beauty.61 The same relief strongly suggests that interpreters were on board the ships tasked with translations to facilitate trade with foreign lands.62 A relief unique to Egyptian art depicts several Syrian brown bears presumably brought back from the Levantine coast by seagoing ships as well. These bears appear in association with 12 redpainted onehandled jars from Syria. The Egyptologists Karin Sowada and William Stevenson Smith have proposed that taken together the bears and jars are likely to constitute a tribute.6364 Trade contacts with Byblos took place during Sahures reign. Excavations of the temple of BaalatGebal yielded an alabaster bowl inscribed with Sahures name.12 The layout of the fourth phase of this temple might even have been influenced by the architecture of Sahures valley templenote 767 although this remains debated.68 There is further corroborating evidence for trade with the wider Levant during the Fifth Dynasty several stone vessels being inscribed with cartouches of pharaohs of this dynasty discovered in Lebanon.note 871 So much so that the archeologist Gregory Mumford points to the fact that Sahure is the best attested king for international relations and has the highest number of texts inscribed in Sinai proportionally to his reign length.72 In his last year Sahure sent the first documented73 expedition to the fabled land of Punt74 probably along the Somalian coast.75 The expedition which is conjectured to have departed Egypt from the harbor of Mersa Gawasis16 is reported on the Palermo Stone6 where it is said to have come back with 80000 of an unspecified measure of myrrh along with malachite 6000 measures of electrum and 2600 or 23020 staves1276 possibly made of ebony.19 In his last year Sahure sent another expedition abroad this time to the copper and turquoise mines of Wadi Maghareh55777 and Wadi Kharit in Sinainote 97980 which had been active since at least the beginning of the Third Dynasty.81 This expedition also mentioned by the Palermo stone6 brought back over 6000 units of turquoise to Egypt61 and produced two reliefs in Sinai one of which shows Sahure in the traditional act of smiting Asiatics12 and boasting The Great God smites the Asiatics of all countries.82 In parallel with these activities diorite quarries near Abu Simbel were exploited throughout Sahures reign.75 Military campaignsedit Silver cylinder seal of king Sahure Walters Art Museum7 Sahures military career is known primarily from reliefs in his mortuary complex. It apparently consisted of campaigns against Libyans from Tjemehu a land possibly located in the northern Western desert.6 These campaigns are said to have yielded livestock in huge numbersnote 10 and Sahure is shown smiting local chieftains. The historical veracity of these depictions remains in doubt as such representations are part of the standard iconography meant to exalt the king.6 The same scene of the Libyan attack was used two hundred years later in the mortuary temple of Pepi II 22842184 BC and in the temple of Taharqa at Kawa built some 1800 years after Sahures lifetime.86 In particular the same names are quoted for the local chieftains. Therefore it is possible that Sahure too was copying an even earlier representation of this scene.8788 Nonetheless several overseers of the Western Nile Delta region were nominated by Sahure a significant decision as these officials occupied an administrative position that existed only irregularly during the Old Kingdom period and which likely served to provide traffic regulation across the EgyptoLibyan border.89 At the same time Sahures mortuary temple presents the earliest known mention of pirates raiding the Nile Delta possibly from the coast of Epirus.90 Sahures pretensions regarding the lands and riches surrounding Egypt are encapsulated in several reliefs from his mortuary temple which show the god Ash telling the king I will give you all that is in this Libya land I give you all hostile peoples with all the provisions that there are in foreign lands and I grant thee all western and eastern foreign lands with all the Iunti and the Montiu bowmen who are in every land.note 119161 Activities in Egyptedit Religious activitiesedit Sahure might have visited Elephantine early in his reign. The majority of Sahures activities in Egypt recorded on the Palermo stone are religious in nature. This royal annal records that in the year of the first time of traveling around Sahure journeyed to the Elephantine fortress where he may have received the submission of the Nubian chiefs in a ceremonial act connected with the commencement of his reign.9293 The fashioning of six statues of the king as well as the subsequent opening of the mouth ceremonies are also reported.94 During Sahures fifth year on the throne the Palermo stone mentions the making of a divine barge possibly in Heliopolis the appointment of 200 priests and the exact quantity of daily offerings of bread and beer to Ra 138 40 and 74 measures in three temples Hathor 4 measures Nekhbet 800 measures and Wadjet 4800 measures fixed by the king.95 Also reported are gifts of lands to temples of between 1 and 204 arouras 
0.7  to nearly 140 acres.82 Concerning Lower Egypt the stone register corresponding to this reign gives the earliest known mention of the city of Athribis in the Delta region.96 Further indication of religious activities lies in that Sahure is the earliest known king to have used the Egyptian title of Nb rtt.97 This title possibly meaning Lord of doing effective things indicates that he personally performed physical cultic activities to ensure the existence and persistence of the Maat the Egyptian concept of order and justice.98 This title remained in use until the time of Herihor some 1500 years later.99 Sahures reign is also the earliest during which the ceremony of the driving of the calves is known to have taken place. This is significant in the context of the progressive emergence of the cult of Osiris throughout the Fifth Dynasty as this ceremony subsequently became an integral part of the Osiris myth. In subsequent times the ceremony corresponded to Seths threshing of Osiris by driving calves trampling fields of barley.100 Sahure reorganized the cult of his mother Nepherhetepes II whose mortuary complex had been built by Userkaf in Saqqara.101 He added an entrance portico with four columns to her temple so that the entrance was not facing Userkafs pyramid any more.101102 Building and mining activitiesedit A statue of Sahure was uncovered in Elkab which may have been the starting point of mining expeditions during his reign. Archeological evidence suggests that Sahures building activities were mostly concentrated in Abusir and its immediate vicinity where he constructed his pyramid and where his sun temple is probably located.103 Also nearby was the palace of Sahure called Uetjes Neferu Sahure Sahures splendor soars up to heaven. The palace is known from an inscription on beef tallow containers discovered in February 2011 in Neferefres mortuary temple.104 A second palace The Crown of Sahure appears is known from an inscription in the tomb of his chief physician.105 Both palaces if they were different buildings were likely on the shores of the Abusir lake.106 The stones for Sahures buildings and statues were quarried throughout Egypt. For example the limestone cladding of the pyramid comes from Tura while the black basalt used for the flooring of Sahures mortuary temple comes from Gebel Qatrani near the Faiyum in Middle Egypt.107 South of Egypt a stele bearing Sahures name was discovered in the diorite quarries located in the desert northwest of Abu Simbel in Lower Nubia.108 Further mining and quarrying expeditions may be inferred from indirect evidence. An inscription of Sahure in the Wadi Abu Geridah in the Eastern desert109 as well as other Old Kingdom inscriptions there suggest that iron ore was mined in the vicinity since the times of the Fourth Dynasty.110 The lower half of a statue with the name of the king was discovered in 2015 in Elkab a location possibly connected with expeditions to the Eastern desert and south of Egypt to Nubia.note 12111 Sahures cartouche has been found in graffiti in Tumas and on seal impressions from Buhen at the second cataract of the Nile in Lower Nubia.112113114 Development of the Egyptian Navyedit Relief from Sahures mortuary temple showing the Egyptian fleet returning from the Levant Sahures reign may have been a time of development for the Egyptian navy. His expeditions to Punt and Byblos demonstrate the existence of a high seas navy and reliefs from his mortuary complex are described by Shelley Wachsmann as the first definite depictions of seagoing ships in Egypt115116 some of which must have been 1
00 cubits long c. 50 m 170 ft.27 Because of this Sahure has been credited by past scholars with establishing the Egyptian navy. It is recognized today that this is an overstatement fragmentary reliefs from Userkafs temple depict numerous boats while a high seas navy must have existed as early as the Third Dynasty.116 The oldest known sea harbor Wadi alJarf on the Red Sea was operating under Khufu.117 Finally there is the distinct possibility that some of the reliefs are copied from earlier examples. Nonetheless Sahure remains the earliest known ruler to have depicted and thus possibly made use of sea power for transporting troops over the Mediterranean sea to Syria.118 The extensive nautical scenes from Sahures mortuary complex are sufficiently detailed to show that specialized racing boats for the military and perhaps for ceremonial training were built at the time.119 They also give the earliest depiction of specific rope uses aboard ships such as that of a hoggingtruss.120 They permit precise estimates regarding shipbuilding for example indicating that the midship freeboard for seagoing vessels was of 1 m 
3.3  ft121 and that the masts employed at the time were bipodal resembling an inverted Y.122 Further rare depictions include the king standing in the stern of a sailing boat with a highly decorated sail123124 and one of only twonote 13 reliefs from ancient Egypt showing men aboard a ship paddling in a wave pattern possibly during a race.126 Court lifeedit Niankhsekhmet and his wife shown on his false door carved and painted in the presence of Sahure Officialsedit Several high officials serving Sahure during his lifetime are known from their tombs as well as from the decoration of the mortuary temple of the king. Niankhsekhmet chief physician of Sahure and first known rhinologist in history127 reports that he asked the king that a false door be made for his Niankhsekhmets tomb to which the king agreed.128 Sahure had the false door made of fine Tura limestone carved and painted blue in his audiencehall and made personal daily inspections of the work.10105129 The king wished a long life to his physician telling him As my nostrils enjoy health as the gods love me may you depart into the cemetery at an advanced old age as one revered.128130 A similar though much less detailed anecdote is reported by Khufuankh who was overseer of the palace and singer of the king.131 Other officials include Hetepka who was keeper of the diadem and overseer of the hairdressers of the king132 Pehenewkai priest of the cult of Userkaf during the reigns of Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai then vizier for the latter133 Persen a mortuary priest in the funerary cult of Sahures mother Nepherhetepesnote 14 and Washptah a priest of Sahure then vizier of Neferirkare Kakai.136 The highofficial Ptahshepses probably born during the reign of Menkaure was high priest of Ptah and royal manicure under Sahure later promoted to vizier by Nyuserre Ini.137 Two viziers of Sahure are known Sekhemkare royal prince son of Khafre and vizier under Userkaf and Sahure138 and Werbauba vizier during Sahures reign attested in the mortuary temple of the king.139140141 Evolution of the high officesedit Werbauba on Sahures royal hunt relief142 Sahure pursued Userkafs policy of appointing nonroyal people to high offices.139143 This is best exemplified by the office of vizier which was exclusively held by princes of royal blood with the title of Kings son since the midFourth Dynasty and up until the early Fifth Dynasty.144 Toward the end of this period princes were progressively excluded from the highest office an evolution undoubtedly correlated with changes in the nature of kingship.145 This process possibly initiated by Menkaure because of dynastic disputes146 seems to have been completed by Sahures time as from then onwards no royal prince was promoted to vizier. Those already in post were allowed to keep their status147 and so in the early part of Sahures reign vizier Sekhemkare was a Kings son while his successor Werbauba seems to have been nonroyal. In response to this change the state administration began its expansion as it included more and more nonroyal people.148 Concurrently with these developments architectural and artistic innovations relating to tombs of private individuals can be dated to Sahures reign. These including torus molding and cornices for false doors first found in Persens tomb.149 This feature would subsequently become common and here demonstrates the particularly high esteem in which Persen must have been held by the king.150 Another innovation is the depiction of small unusual offerings such as that of seven sacred oils on false doors first found in Niankhsekhmets tomb.151 The canonical list of offerings was also developed during or shortly before Sahures time in the tombs of the royal family and spread to those of nonroyal highofficials152  the earliest of whom was Seshemnefer I  under Sahure.153 Sun templesedit Sekhetreedit Sahure built or started to build a temple dedicated to the sun god Ra the second such temple of the Fifth Dynasty. Yet to be located it is known to have existed thanks to an inscription on the Palermo stone where it is called Sekhetre also spelt Sekhet Re meaning The Field of Ra82 as well as mentions of it in 24 tombs of administration officials.154 A few limestone blocks bearing reliefs which once adorned the temple have been found embedded in the walls of the mortuary complex of Nyuserre Ini Sahures fourth successor.103 This suggests either that these blocks were leftovers from the construction of the temple or as Wener Kaiser has posited155 that Nyuserre dismantled Sahures temple156 using it as a quarry for construction materials because it was largely unfinished.52103 Indeed the rather meager evidence for the Sekhetre leads Miroslav Verner to propose that it never fully functioned as a sun temple.156 New analyses of the verso of the Palermo stone performed in 2018 by the Czech Institute of Archeology enabled the reading of further inscriptions mentioning precisely the architecture of the temple as well as lists of donations it received establishing firmly that it was a distinct entity from the earlier sun temple of Userkaf the Nekhenre but leaving its ultimate fate uncertain.157 Further precision as to the architecture of the temple may be inferred from the absence156 of the obelisk determinative in some hieroglyphic variants of the name Sekhetre and its presence in others. For Anthony Spalinger this possibly indicates that Sahures sun temple was effectively built and acquired such an obelisk at some point after its construction perhaps after Sahures reign.158 Nekhenreedit Userkaf was the first king to build a sun temple in Abusir. Known to the ancient Egyptians as the Nekhenre or Fortress of Re it was unfinished at his death. Construction works continued in at least four building phases the first of which may have taken place under Sahure156 and then under his successors Neferirkare Kakai and Nyuserre Ini.159160 Pyramid complexedit Main article Pyramid of Sahure The ruined pyramid of Sahure as seen from the pyramids causeway Sahure built a pyramid complex for his tomb and funerary cult named Khaba Sahura161 which is variously translated as The Rising of the Ba Spirit of Sahure162163 The Ba of Sahure appears6 Sahures pyramid where the royal soul rises in splendor164 or In glory comes forth the soul of Sahure.165 The builders and artisans who worked on Sahures mortuary complex lived in an enclosed pyramid town located next to the causeway leading up to Sahures pyramid and mortuary temple. The town later flourished under Nyuserre and seems to have still been in the existence during the First Intermediate Period.166 In terms of the size volume and the cheap construction techniques employed Sahures pyramid exemplifies the decline of pyramid building.note 15 At the same time the quality and variety of the stones employed in other parts of the complex increased168 and the mortuary temple is considered to be the most sophisticated one built up to that time.12 With its many architectural innovations such as the use of palmiform columns the overall layout of Sahures complex would serve as the template for all mortuary complexes constructed from Sahures reign until the end of the Sixth Dynasty some 300 years later.27169 The highly varied colored reliefs decorating the walls of the entire funerary complex display a quality of workmanship and a richness of conception that reach their highest level of the entire Old Kingdom period.168 Locationedit Sahure chose to construct his pyramid complex in Abusir thereby abandoning both Saqqara and Giza which had been the royal necropolises up to that time. A possible motivation for Sahures decision was the presence of the sun temple of Userkaf170 something which supports the hypothesis that Sahure was Userkafs son.171 Following Sahures choice Abusir became the main necropolis of the early Fifth Dynasty as pharaohs Neferirkare Kakai Neferefre Nyuserre Ini and possibly Shepseskare built their pyramids there. In their wake many smaller tombs belonging to members of the royal family were built in Abusir with the notable exceptions of those of the highestranking members many of whom chose to be buried in Giza or Saqqarah.172 Mortuary templeedit Nome deities and personified agricultural estates marching into the mortuary temple of Sahure with offerings Sahures mortuary temple was extensively decorated with an estimated 10000 m2 110000 sq ft of fine reliefs.173 This extensive decoration seems to have been completed within Sahures lifetime.174 The walls of the entire 235 m 771 ftlong causeway were also covered with polychrome basreliefs.162175 Miroslav Brta describes the reliefs as the largest collection known from the third millennium BCE.176 Many surviving fragments of the reliefs which decorated the walls of the mortuary complex are of very high quality and much more elaborate than those from preceding mortuary temples.9177 Several of the depictions are unique in Egyptian art. These include a relief showing Sahure tending a myrrh tree Commiphora myrrha in his palace in front of his family178179 a relief depicting Syrian brown bears and another showing the bringing of the pyramidion to the main pyramid and the ceremonies following the completion of the complex.180 The high craftmanship of the reliefs is here manifested by the finely rounded edges of all figures so that they simultaneously blend in with the background and stand out clearly.181 Reliefs are sufficiently detailed to permit the identification of the animals shown such as hedgehogs and jerboas182 and even show personified plants such as corn represented as a man with cornears instead of hair.90 The many reliefs of the mortuary causeway and valley temples also depict among other things Sahure hunting wild bulls and hippopotamuses183 Sahure being suckled by Nekhbet184 the earliest depictions of a king fishing and fowling185186 a counting of foreigners by or in front of the goddess Seshat which Egyptologist Mark Lehner believes was meant to ward off any evil or disorder162 the god Sopdu Lord of the Foreign Countries leading bound Asiatic captives72 and the return of an Egyptian fleet from Asia perhaps Byblos. Some of the low reliefcuttings in red granite are still in place at the site.28187 Among the seminal innovations of Sahures temple are the earliest relief depictions of figures in adoration either standing or squatting with both arms raised their hands open and their palms facing down.188 The mortuary temple featured the first palmiform columns of any Egyptian temple27 massive granite architraves inscribed with Sahures titulary overlaid with copper lionheaded waterspouts black basalt flooring189 and granite dados.27 Pyramidedit A massive pink granite architrave inscribed with Sahures titulary from the courtyard of his mortuary temple The pyramid of Sahure reached 47 m 154 ft at the time of its construction162 much smaller than the pyramids of the preceding Fourth Dynasty. Its inner core is made of roughly hewn stones organized in steps and held together in many sections with a thick mortar of mud. This construction technique much cheaper and faster to execute than the stonebased techniques hitherto employed fared much worse over time. Owing to this Sahures pyramid is now largely ruined and amounts to little more than a pile of rubble showing the crude filling of debris and mortar constituting the core which became exposed after the casing stones were stolen in antiquity.27 While the core was under construction a corridor was left open leading into the shaft where the grave chamber was built separately and later covered by leftover stone blocks and debris. This construction strategy is clearly visible in later unfinished pyramids in particular the Pyramid of Neferefre.27 This technique also reflects the older style from the Third Dynasty seemingly coming back into fashion after being temporarily abandoned by the builders of the five great pyramids at Dahshur and Giza during the Fourth Dynasty.27 The entrance at the north side is a short descending corridor lined with red granite followed by a passageway ending at the burial chamber with its gabled roof comprising large limestone beams of several tons each.190 Today all of these beams are fractured which weakens the pyramid structure. Fragments of a basalt sarcophagus likely Sahures were found here in the burial chamber when it was first entered by John Shae Perring in the mid 
19 th century.27 The mortuary complex immediately around the pyramid also includes a second smaller cult pyramid which must have stood nearly 12 m 39 ft high originally built for the Ka of the king.27 Legacyedit Palmiform columns an innovation of Sahures temple became a hallmark of Egyptian architecture.27 Artistic and architectural legacyedit The painted reliefs covering the walls of Sahures mortuary temple were recognized as an artistic achievement of the highest degree by the Ancient Egyptians. A New Kingdom inscription found in Abusir for example poetically compares the temple to the heaven lit by full moon.191 Subsequent generations of artists and craftsmen tried to emulate Sahures reliefs using them as templates for the tombs of later kings and queens of the Old Kingdom period.192 The layout of Sahures high temple was also novel and it became the standard template for all subsequent pyramid complexes of the Old Kingdom. Some of its architectural elements such as its palmiform columns became hallmarks of Egyptian architecture.note 1627194 This trend continued to hold in later times. For example in the Middle Kingdom Senusret I had reliefs for his temple directly copied from those of Sahure. He also chose to follow the innovative layout of Sahures complex once again. At the time Senusret Is decision was in stark contrast with the burial customs of the 
11 th Dynasty pharaohs who were buried in saff tombs. These consisted of an open courtyard fronting a row of entrances into subterranean corridors and chambers dug in the hillsides of ElTarif and Deir elBahari near Thebes.note 17195 Cultsedit Old Kingdomedit Sahure was the object of a funerary cult from the time of his death and which continued until the end of the Old Kingdom some 300 years later. At least 22 agricultural estates were established to produce the goods necessary for providing the offerings to be made for this cult.139 Decorated reliefs from the upper part of the causeway represent the procession of over 150 personified funerary domains created by and for Sahure demonstrating the existence of a sophisticated economic system associated with the kings funerary cult.196 The enormous quantities of offerings pouring into the mortuary and sun temples of Sahure benefitted other cults as well such as that of Hathor which had priests officiating on the temple premises.197 Several priests serving the mortuary cult or in Sahures sun temple during the later Fifth and Sixth Dynasties are known thanks to inscriptions and artifacts from their tombs in Saqqara and Abusir.198 These include Tjy overseer of the sun temples of Sahure Neferirkare Neferefre and Nyuserre199 Neferkai priest of Sahures funerary cult200 Khabauptah priest of Sahure Neferirkare Neferefre and Niuserre201202 Atjema priest of the sun temple of Sahure during the Sixth Dynasty203 Khuyemsnewy who served as priest of the mortuary cult of Sahure during the reigns of Neferirkare and Nyuserrenote 18 Nikare priest of the cult of Sahure and overseer of the scribes of the granary during the Fifth Dynasty.205 Further priests are known such as Senewankh serving in the cults of Userkaf and Sahure and buried in a mastaba in Saqqara206 Sedaug a priest of the cult of Sahure priest of Ra in the suntemple of Userkaf and holder of the title of royal acquaintance207 Tepemankh priest of the cults of kings of the Fourth to early Fifth Dynasty including Userkaf and Sahure buried in a mastaba at Abusir.208209210 Middle Kingdomedit Statue of Sahure enthroned commissioned by Senusret I211 No priest serving in the funerary cult of Sahure is known from the Middle Kingdom period. Evidence from this period rather come from works undertaken in the Karnak temple by 
12 th Dynasty pharaoh Senusret I fl. 
20 th century BC who dedicated statues of Old Kingdom kings212 including one of Sahure.note 19214 The statue and the accompanying group of portraits of deceased kings indicates the existence of a generic cult of royal ancestor figures a limited version of the cult of the divine as Jaromir Mlek writes.215 The statue of Sahure now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo catalog number CG 42004 is made of black granite and is 50 cm 20 in tall. Sahure is shown enthroned wearing a pleated skirt and a round curly wig. Both sides of the throne bear inscriptions identifying the work as a portrait of Sahure made on the orders of Senusret I.216 Sahures legacy had endured sufficiently by the Middle Kingdom period that he is mentioned in a story of the Westcar Papyrus probably written during the 
12 th Dynasty although the earliest extent copy dates to the Seventeenth Dynasty.217 The papyrus tells the mythical story of the origins of the Fifth Dynasty presenting kings Userkaf Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai as three brothers sons of Ra and a woman named Rededjet destined to supplant Khufus line.34 New Kingdom emergence of Sekhmet of Sahureedit As a deceased king Sahure continued to receive religious offerings during the New Kingdom as part of the standard cult of the royal ancestors. For example Sahure is present on the Karnak king list a list of kings inscribed on the walls of the Akhmenu the Karnak temple of Thutmose III. Unlike other ancient Egyptian king lists the kings there are not listed in chronological order. Rather the purpose of the list was purely religious its aim being to name the deceased kings to be honored in the Karnak temple.214 In the second part of the Eighteenth Dynasty and during the Nineteenth Dynasty numerous visitors left inscriptions stelae and statues in the temple.218219 These activities were related to a cult then taking place in the mortuary temple of Sahure since the time of Thutmose III. This cult was devoted to the deified king in a form associated with the goddess Sekhmet220221222 named Sekhmet of Sahure.223 For example the scribe Ptahemuia and fellow scribes visited Sahures temple in the 
30 th year of Ramses IIs reign c. 1249 BC to ask Sekhmet to grant them a long life of 110 years.224 The reason for the appearance of this cult during the New Kingdom is unknown.225 In any case the cult of Sekhmet of Sahure was not a purely local phenomenon as traces of it were found in the Upper Egyptian village of Deir elMedina where it was celebrated during two festivals taking place every year on the 
16 th day of the first month of Peret and on the 
11 th day of the fourth month of that season.226 During the same period prince Khaemwaset a son of Ramses II undertook works throughout Egypt on pyramids and temples which had fallen into ruin possibly to appropriate stones for his fathers construction projects while ensuring a minimal restoration for cultic purposes.227 Inscriptions on the stone cladding of the pyramid of Sahure show that it was the object of such works at this time.198228 This renewed attention had negative consequences as the first wave of dismantlement of the Abusir monuments particularly for the acquisition of valuable Tura limestone arrived with it. Sahures mortuary temple may have been spared at this time due to the presence of the cult of Sekhmet.229 The cults influence likely waned after the end of Ramses IIs reign becoming a site of local worship only.230 Third intermediate late and Ptolemaic periodsedit During the Twentyfifth Dynasty 744656 BC at the end of the Third Intermediate Period some of Sahures temple reliefs were copied by Taharqa231 including images of the king crushing his enemies as a sphinx.232 Shortly after under the Twentysixth Dynasty 664525 BC of the Late Period a statue of Sahure was among a group of statues of Old Kingdom kings hidden in a cachette of the Karnak temple testifying to some form of cultic interest up to that time.233 In parallel a new period of dismantlement of the pyramids of Abusir took place yet Sahures was once again spared. This might be because of the cult of Sekhmet of Sahure223 the temple hosted well into the Ptolemaic period 33230 BC albeit with a very reduced influence.234 Several graffiti dating from the reigns of Amasis II 570526 BC Darius II 423404 BC and up until the Ptolemaic period attest to continued cultic activities on the site.198235236 For example a certain Horib was Priest of Sekhmet of the temple of Sekhmet of Sahure under the Ptolemaic dynasty.237 The dismantlement of Sahures pyramid started in earnest in the Roman period as shown by the abundant production of millstones presence of lime production facilities and worker shelters in the vicinity.238 In Contemporary Cultureedit Sahures name and that of his father were used in the 1983 Sesame Street special Dont Eat the Pictures. A cursed child from ancient Egypt introduces himself as Prince Sahure of Egypt son of the god Userkof king of kings lord of the two lands conquered of the east and west and fabulous fisherman.239 Notesedit  Proposed dates for the reign of Sahure 25172505 BC4 25062492 BC56 24962483 BC78 24912477 BC9 24872475 BC10111213141516 24712458 BC17 24582446 BC11819 244624
33 BC8 24282417 BC20 24282416 BC.21  Ancient Egyptian MwtNswt.31  In a version of this theory Khentkaus possibly remarried Userkaf after the death of her first husband33 and became the mother of Sahure and his successor on the throne Neferirkare Kakai.10 This theory is based on the fact that Khentkaus is known to have borne the title of mwt nswt bity nswt bity which could be translated as mother of two kings. A story from the Westcar Papyrus tells of a magician foretelling to Khufu that the future demise of his lineage will come from three brothers born of the god Ra and a woman named Rededjet who will reign successively as the first three kings of the Fifth Dynasty.34 Some Egyptologists have therefore proposed that Khentkaus was the mother of Sahure and the historical figure on which Rededjet is based. Following the discoveries of Verner and ElAwady in Abusir this theory has been abandoned29 and the real role of Khentkaus remains difficult to ascertain. This is in part because the translation of her title is problematic and because the details of the transition from the Fourth to the Fifth Dynasty are not yet clear. In particular an ephemeral pharaoh Djedefptah may have ruled between Shepseskaf and Userkaf.33  The first pharaoh to have a throne name called the prenomen different from his birth name called the nomen  During the Old Kingdom period the Egyptians did not record time as we do today. Rather they counted years since the beginning of the reign of the current king. Furthermore these years were referred to by the number of cattle counts which had taken place since the start of the reign. The cattle count was an important event aimed at evaluating the amount of taxes to be levied on the population. This involved counting cattle oxen and small livestock.51 During the first half of the Fifth Dynasty this count might have been biennial52 although it may not always have happened at regular intervals.53 Following these principles the Palermo stone actually talks of the years after the first second and either sixth or seventh54 cattle counts of Sahures reign. If the count was indeed biennial which is uncertain this would correspond to Sahures second third and fourteenth years.  In the context of Egyptology the term Asiatics is used to refer to people from the Levant including Canaan modernday Lebanon and the southern coast of modernday Turkey.  It is possible that the Egyptians wielded sufficient influence over Byblos at the time to have the temple built to satisfy their cultic needs as they could have sought the protection of Baalat as a form of Hathor. As this remains conjectural alternative explanations have been brought forth to explain the presence of Egyptian artifacts and Egyptian influence on the temple layout. The architects of the temple may have been Egyptians working for the Byblite king while the alabaster bowl found in the temple could come from Egyptian payments to the Byblite king for wood65 or it may have been donated by pious individuals.66 While the Egyptian influence over Byblos cannot be denied there is far from enough evidence to conclude that Byblos functioned as an Egyptian colony at the time of Sahure.66  Finally a piece of thin gold stamped to a wooden throne and bearing Sahures cartouches has been purportedly found during illegal excavations in Turkey among a wider assemblage known as the Dorak Treasure.9696 The existence of the treasure is now widely doubted.70  The expedition to the copper mine of Wadi Kharit left an inscription reading Horus LordofRisings the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Sahure granted life eternally. Thot lordofterror who smashes Asia.78  The relief say that the following was taken as bounty over 123440 cattle more than 223200 donkeys 232413 goats and 243688 sheep.83 In another scene 212400 donkeys are said to have been taken.8485 Even if these numbers are overestimates they show that Tjemehu was seen by the Egyptians as a rich land83 and that economic considerations motivated Egyptians attempts at controlling the neighboring lands.60  The Iunti and Montiu were Nubian and Asiatic nomads respectively.91  This is one of only three known statues of Sahure the other two being that of Sahure with a nome god heading this article and that dedicated by Senusret I shown at the end this article.111  The only other similar relief is found in Userkafs temple.125  His mastaba tomb is located close to Nepherhetepess pyramid in Saqqara.29134135  For example Sahures main pyramid had a volume of 98000 m3 3500000 cu ft versus Khufus 2595000 m3 91600000 cu ft.167  The standard work on Sahures pyramid complex is Borchardts excavation report available online in its entirety.193  This change may have been spurred by the return of the Egyptian capital to Middle Egypt in Itjtawy close to Memphis and the attraction of then already ancient pyramids of the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties.195  Khuyemsnewy was also priest of Ra and Hathor in Neferirkares sun temple priest of Neferirkare priest in Nyuserre Inis and Neferirkare Kakais pyramid complexes and Overseer of the Two Granaries.204  Another statue from this group is that of Intef the Elder.213 Referencesedit  a b MET 2015.
