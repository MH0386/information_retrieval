Located 100 kilometres 62 miles southwest of Cairo in the Faiyum Oasis it is the capital of the modern Faiyum Governorate. Originally called Shedet in Egyptian the Greeks called it in Koin Greek  romanized Krokodilpolis and later Medieval Greek  romanized Arsino.2 It is one of Egypts oldest cities due to its strategic location.2 Name and etymologyedit d.t3 in hieroglyphs p
3 ym in hieroglyphs Originally founded by the ancient Egyptians as Shedet its current name in English is also spelled as Fayum Faiyum or alFaiym. Faiyum was also previously officially named Madnat alFaiym Arabic for The City of Faiyum. The name Faiyum and its spelling variations may also refer to the Faiyum Oasis although it is commonly used by Egyptians today to refer to the city.45 The modern name of the city comes from Coptic    epiompeiom whence the proper name  payom meaning the Sea or the Lake which in turn comes from late Egyptian pym of the same meaning a reference to the nearby Lake Moeris the extinct elephant ancestor Phiomia was named after it. Ancient historyedit Crocodilopolis redirects here. For the namesake sites in Upper Egypt and Israel see Crocodilopolis disambiguation. Archaeological evidence has found occupations around the Faiyum dating back to at least the Epipalaeolithic. Middle Holocene occupations of the area are most widely studied on the north shore of Lake Moeris where Gertrude Caton Thompson and Elinor Wight Gardner did a number of excavations of Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic sites as well as a general survey of the area.6 Recently the area has been further investigated by a team from the UCLARUGUOA Fayum Project.78 According to Roger S. Bagnall habitation began in the fifth millennium BC and a settlement was established by the Old Kingdom c.26852180 BC called Shedet Medinet elFayyum.9 It was the most significant centre of the cult of the crocodile god Sobek borrowed from the Demotic pronunciation as Koin Greek  Sokhos and then into Latin as Suchus. In consequence the Greeks called it Crocodile City Koin Greek  Krokodeilpolis which was borrowed into Latin as Crocodlopolis. The city worshipped a tamed sacred crocodile called in Koine Petsuchos the Son of Soukhos that was adorned with gold and gem pendants. The Petsoukhos lived in a special temple pond and was fed by the priests with food provided by visitors. When Petsuchos died it was replaced by another.1011 El Faiyum map Under the Ptolemaic Kingdom the city was called Ptolemais Euergtis Koin Greek  .12 until Ptolemy II Philadelphus 309246 BC renamed the city Arsino and the whole nome after the name of his sisterwife Arsinoe II 316270 or 268 who was deified after her death as part of the Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great the official religion of the kingdom.13 Ptolemy II Philadelphus also established a town at the edge of Faiyum named Philadelphia. It was laid out in a regular grid plan to resemble a typical Greek city with private dwellings palaces baths and a theatre.14 Under the Roman Empire Arsino became part of the province of Arcadia Aegypti. To distinguish it from other cities of the same name it was called Arsino in Arcadia. With the arrival of Christianity Arsino became the seat of a bishopric a suffragan of Oxyrhynchus the capital of the province and the metropolitan see. Michel Le Quien gives the names of several bishops of Arsino nearly all of them associated with one heresy or another.15 The Catholic Church considering Arsino in Arcadia to be no longer a residential bishopric lists it as a titular see.16 Fayyum was the seat of Shahralanyozan governor of the Sasanian Egypt 6196
29.1 7 The 
10 thcentury Bible exegete Saadia Gaon thought elFayyum to have actually been the biblical city of Pithom mentioned in Exodus 1
11.1 8 Around 1245 CE the region became the subject of the most detailed government survey to survive from the medieval Arab world conducted by Ab Amr Uthman Ibn alNbulus.19 Faiyum mummy portraitsedit Portrait of a man c.125150 AD. Encaustic on wood 37 cm  20 cm 15 in  8 in Main article Fayum mummy portraits Faiyum is the source of some famous death masks or mummy portraits painted during the Roman occupation of the area. The Egyptians continued their practice of burying their dead despite the Roman preference for cremation. While under the control of the Roman Empire Egyptian death masks were painted on wood in a pigmented wax technique called encausticthe Faiyum mummy portraits represent this technique.20 While previously believed to represent Greek settlers in Egypt2122 modern studies conclude that the Faiyum portraits instead represent mainly native Egyptians reflecting the complex synthesis of the predominant Egyptian culture and that of the elite Greek minority in the city.232425 The Zenon Papyriedit Fragment of a papyrus letter discussing tax issues from the Zenon Archive National Archaeological Museum Athens Main article Zenon of Kaunos The construction of the settlement of Philadelphia under Ptolemy II Philadelphus was recorded in detail by a 
3 rdcentury BC Greek public official named Zeno or Zenon Greek . Zeno a native of Kaunos in lower Asia Minor came to Faiyum to work as private secretary to Apollonius the finance minister to Ptolemy II Philadelphus and later to Ptolemy III Euergetes. During his employment Zeno wrote detailed descriptions of the construction of theatres gymnasiums palaces and baths in the 2
50 s and 2
40 s BC as well as making copious written records of various legal and financial transactions between citizens.14262728 During the winter of 19141915 a cache of over 2000 papyrus documents was uncovered by Egyptian agricultural labourers who were digging for sebakh near Km elKharaba elKebir. Upon examination by Egyptology scholars these documents were found to be records written by Zeno in Greek and Demotic. These papyri now referred to as the Zenon Archive or the Zenon Papyri have provided historians with a detailed record of 
3 rdcentury BC Philadelphia society and economy.29 The discovery site was identified as the former location of ancient Philadelphia. Today the precise location of the town is unknown although archaeologists have identified two sites in northeast Faiyum as the possible location for Philadelphia.2830 Modern cityedit JeanLon Grme View of Medinet ElFayoum c.18681870 Faiyum has several large bazaars mosques31 baths and a muchfrequented weekly market.32 The canal called Bahr Yussef runs through the city its banks lined with houses. There are two bridges over the river one of three arches which carries the main street and bazaar and one of two arches over which is built the Qaitbay mosque32 a gift from his wife to honor the Mamluk Sultan in Fayoum. Mounds north of the city mark the site of Arsinoe known to the ancient Greeks as Crocodilopolis where in ancient times the sacred crocodile kept in Lake Moeris was worshipped.3233 The center of the city is on the canal with four waterwheels which were adopted by the governorate of Fayoum as its symbol their chariots and bazaars are easy to spot. The city is home of the football club Misr Lel Makkasa SC that play in the Egyptian Premier League.

Addison Wesley ISBN 0321016181 But what we really want to know is to what extent the Alexandrian mathematicians of the period from the first to the fifth centuries C.E. were Greek. Certainly all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. And most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted ... So should we assume that Ptolemy and Diophantus Pappus and Hypatia were ethnically Greek that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians It is of course impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities ... And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition even from the founding of Alexandria small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfil numerous civic roles. Of course it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become Hellenized to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist.  Who was Zenon. apps.lib.umich.edu. University of Michigan. Retrieved 20 April 2021.
