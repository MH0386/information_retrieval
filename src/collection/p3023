Nerva became emperor when aged almost 66 after a lifetime of imperial service under Nero and the succeeding rulers of the Flavian dynasty. Under Nero he was a member of the imperial entourage and played a vital part in exposing the Pisonian conspiracy of 65. Later as a loyalist to the Flavians he attained consulships in 71 and 90 during the reigns of Vespasian and Domitian respectively. On 19 September 96 Domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy involving members of the Praetorian Guard and several of his freedmen. On the same day Nerva was declared emperor by the Roman Senate. As the new ruler of the Roman Empire he vowed to restore liberties which had been curtailed during the autocratic government of Domitian. Nervas brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army. A revolt by the Praetorian Guard in October 97 essentially forced him to adopt an heir. After some deliberation Nerva adopted Trajan a young and popular general as his successor. After barely fifteen months in office Nerva died of natural causes on 27 January 98. Upon his death he was succeeded and deified by Trajan. Although much of his life remains obscure Nerva was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians. Nervas greatest success was ensuring a peaceful transition of power after his death by selecting Trajan as his heir thus founding the NervaAntonine dynasty. He was the first of the Five Good Emperors. Early careeredit Early lifeedit Marcus Cocceius Nerva born in the village of Narni 50 kilometers north of Rome as the son of Marcus Cocceius Nerva suffect consul during the reign of Caligula 3741 and Sergia Plautilla.2 He was born on 8 November3 but the exact year is disputed. Ancient sources report the date as either 30 or 
35.4  He had at least one attested sister named Cocceia who married Lucius Salvius Otho Titianus the brother of the earlier Emperor Otho.2 Like Vespasian the founder of the Flavian dynasty Nerva was a member of a newer Italian nobility rather than one of the JulioClaudians.5 Nevertheless the Cocceii were among the most esteemed and prominent political families of the late Republic and early Empire attaining consulships in each successive generation.6 The direct ancestors of Nerva on his fathers side all named Marcus Cocceius Nerva were associated with imperial circles from the time of Emperor Augustus r.27 BC  AD 
14.6  His greatgrandfather was consul in 36 BC in replacement and abdicated and Governor of Asia in the same year. His grandfather became suffect consul in July of either 21 or 22 and was known as a personal friend of Emperor Tiberius r.1437 accompanying the emperor during his voluntary seclusion on Capri from 23 onwards dying in 33. Nervas father finally attained the consulship under the Emperor Caligula. The Cocceii were connected with the JulioClaudian dynasty through the marriage of Sergia Plautillas brother Gaius Octavius Laenas and Rubellia Bassa the greatgranddaughter of Tiberius.5 Imperial serviceedit The Roman Empire during the Year of the Four Emperors 69 Blue areas indicate provinces loyal to Vespasian and Gaius Licinius Mucianus Green areas indicate provinces loyal to Vitellius Not much of Nervas early life or career is recorded but it appears he did not pursue the usual administrative or military career. He was praetorelect in the year 65 and like his ancestors moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist.2 As an advisor to Emperor Nero he successfully helped detect and expose the Pisonian conspiracy of 65. His exact contribution to the investigation is not known but his services must have been considerable since they earned him rewards equal to those of Neros guard prefect Tigellinus. He received triumphal honors  which was usually reserved for military victories  and the right to have his statues placed throughout the palace.2 According to the contemporary poet Martial Nero also held Nervas literary abilities in high esteem hailing him as the Tibullus of our time.7 Another prominent member of Neros entourage was Vespasian an old and respected general who had celebrated military triumphs during the 
40 s. It appears Vespasian befriended Nerva during his time as an imperial advisor and may have asked him to watch over Vespasians youngest son Domitian when Vespasian departed for the Jewish war in 
67.8  The suicide of Nero on 9 June 68 brought the JulioClaudian dynasty to an end leading to the chaotic Year of the Four Emperors which saw the successive rise and fall of the emperors Galba Otho and Vitellius until the accession of Vespasian on 21 December 69. Virtually nothing is known of Nervas whereabouts during 69 but despite the fact that Otho was his brotherinlaw he appears to have been one of the earliest and strongest supporters of the Flavians.9 For services unknown he was rewarded with a consulship early in Vespasians reign in 71. This was a remarkable honour not only because he held this office early under the new regime but also because it was an ordinary consulship instead of a less prestigious suffect consulship making him one of the few nonFlavians to be honoured in this way under Vespasian.9 After 71 Nerva again disappears from historical record presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under Vespasian 6979 and his sons Titus 7981 and Domitian 8196. He reemerges during the revolt of Saturninus in 89. On 1 January 89 the governor of Germania Superior Lucius Antonius Saturninus and his two legions at Mainz Legio XIV Gemina and Legio XXI Rapax revolted against the Roman Empire with the aid of a tribe of the Chatti.10 The governor of Germania Inferior Lappius Maximus moved to the region at once assisted by the procurator of Rhaetia Titus Flavius Norbanus. Within twentyfour days the rebellion was crushed and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished. The mutinous legions were sent to the front of Illyricum while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded.11 Domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with Nerva. Again the honour suggested Nerva had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero. Alternatively Domitian may have selected Nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status quo of the regime.9 The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire could return to order. Emperoredit Accessionedit A bust of emperor Domitian. Capitoline Museums Rome. On 18 September 96 Domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy organised by court officials.12 The Fasti Ostienses the Ostian Calendar records that the same day the Senate proclaimed Marcus Cocceius Nerva emperor.13 This was the first time the Roman Senate actually chose a new emperor rather than simply ratifying formally a choice made by either a previous emperor in his testament or an army or the Praetorian Guard.14 Despite his political experience this was a remarkable choice. Nerva was old and childless and had spent much of his career out of the public light prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in Domitians assassination although his probable lack of involvement would have made him acceptable to the Domitianic faction.1516 According to Cassius Dio the conspirators approached Nerva as a potential successor prior to the assassination which indicates that he was at least aware of the plot.1718 Suetonius by contrast does not mention Nerva but he may have omitted his role out of tactfulness. Considering the works of Suetonius were published under Nervas direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder.17 On the other hand Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire and as a known Flavian loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history19 but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate within hours after the news of the assassination broke.13 Although he appeared to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health Nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless.20 Furthermore he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts he accepted.21 The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war but neither the Senate nor Nerva appears to have been involved in the conspiracy against Domitian.22 Following the accession of Nerva as emperor the Senate passed damnatio memoriae on Domitian his statues were melted his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records.2324 In many instances existing portraits of Domitian such as those found on the Cancelleria Reliefs were simply recarved to fit the likeness of Nerva. This allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material.25 In addition the vast palace which Domitian had erected on the Palatine Hill known as the Flavian Palace was renamed the House of the People and Nerva himself took up residence in Vespasians former villa in the Gardens of Sallust.26 Administrationedit The last remaining columns from the largely blind peristyle surrounding a temple to Minerva located at the heart of the Forum of Nerva. The visible door frame is not an original element but rather one of the many modifications made during the Middle Ages. The change of government was welcome particularly to the senators who had been harshly persecuted during Domitians reign. As an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters Nerva publicly swore that no senators would be put to death as long as he remained in office.27 He called an end to trials based on treason released those who had been imprisoned under these charges and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled.24 All properties which had been confiscated by Domitian were returned to their respective families.24 Nerva also sought to involve the Senate in his government but this was not entirely successful. He continued to rely largely on friends and advisors who were known and trusted and by maintaining friendly relations with the proDomitianic faction of the Senate he incurred hostility which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life.2829 Since Suetonius says the people were ambivalent at Domitians death Nerva had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the Roman populace. As was custom by this time a change of emperor was expected to bring with it a generous payment of gifts and money to the people and the army. Accordingly a congiarium of 75 denarii per head was bestowed upon the citizens while the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard received a donativum which may have amounted to as much as 5000 denarii per person.30 This was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most needy Romans.31 To the poorest Nerva granted allotments of land worth up to 60 million sesterces.27 He exempted parents and their children from a 5 inheritance tax and he made loans to Italian landowners on the condition that they pay interest of 5 to their municipality to support the children of needy families  alimenta schemes which were later expanded by Trajan Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius.32 Furthermore numerous taxes were remitted and privileges granted to Roman provinces.30 Namely he abolished abuses of the Fiscus Iudaicus the additional tax which all Jews throughout the Empire had to pay some of his coins bear the legend FISCI IUDAICI CALUMNIA SUBLATA abolition of malicious prosecution regarding the Jewish tax. Coins suggest he added new games in the Circus in honor of Neptune. Other coins refer to imperial ideals such as equity justice and liberty which contrasted his reign with that of Domitian. Before long Nervas expenses strained the economy of Rome and although perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by Syme33 necessitated the formation of a special commission of economy to drastically reduce expenditures.34 The most superfluous religious sacrifices games and horse races were abolished while new income was generated from Domitians former possessions including the auctioning of ships estates and even furniture.27 Large amounts of money were obtained from Domitians silver and gold statues and Nerva forbade that similar images be made in his honor.24 Because he reigned only briefly Nervas public works were few instead completing projects which had been initiated under Flavian rule. This included extensive repairs to the Roman road system and the expansion of the aqueducts. The latter program was headed by the former consul Sextus Julius Frontinus who helped to put an end to abuses and later published a significant work on Romes water supply De aquaeductu.35 The only major landmarks constructed under Nerva were a horreum granary known as the Horrea Nervae36 and the Forum of Nerva begun by Domitian which linked the Forum of Augustus to the Temple of Peace.37 Little remains partly because the Via dei Fori Imperiali cuts across it. Crisis of successionedit Roman aureus struck under Nerva c. 97. The reverse reads Concordia Exercituum symbolizing the unity between the emperor and the Roman army with two clasped hands over an army standard. Caption IMP. NERVA CAES. AVG. P. M. TR. P. CONS. III P. P.  CONCORDIA EXERCITVVM Despite Nervas measures to remain popular with the Senate and the Roman people support for Domitian remained strong in the army which had called for his deification immediately after the assassination.23 In an attempt to appease the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard Nerva had dismissed their prefect Titus Petronius Secundus  one of the chief conspirators against Domitian  and replaced him with a former commander Casperius Aelianus.38 Likewise the generous donativum bestowed upon the soldiers following his accession was expected swiftly to silence any protests against the violent regime change. The Praetorians considered these measures insufficient however and demanded the execution of Domitians assassins which Nerva refused.39 Continued dissatisfaction with this state of affairs would ultimately lead to the gravest crisis of Nervas reign. While the swift transfer of power following Domitians death had prevented a civil war from erupting Nervas position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority. Upon his accession he had ordered a halt to treason trials but at the same time allowed the prosecution of informers by the Senate to continue. This measure led to chaos as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies leading the consul Fronto to famously remark that Domitians tyranny was ultimately preferable to Nervas anarchy.24 Early in 97 a conspiracy led by the senator Gaius Calpurnius Piso Crassus Frugi Licinianus failed but once again Nerva refused to put the conspirators to death much to the disapproval of the Senate.4041 Bronze statue of Nerva in the Via dei Fori Imperiali Rome The situation was further aggravated by the absence of a clear successor made more pressing because of Nervas old age and sickness.42 He had no natural children of his own and only distant relatives who were unsuited for political office. A successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals in the Empire and it appears that by 97 Nerva was considering to adopt Marcus Cornelius Nigrinus Curiatius Maternus the powerful governor of Syria.43 This was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander Trajan a general of the armies at the German frontier.43 In October 97 these tensions came to a head when the Praetorian Guard led by Casperius Aelianus laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage.29 He was forced to submit to their demands agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitians death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians.44 Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius Domitians former chamberlain were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault but his authority was damaged beyond repair.29 Trajan later dispatched those commanders who had ordered the guard to besiege Nerva in his home. Nerva realized that his position was no longer tenable without the support of an heir who had the approval of both the army and the people.3845 Shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor29 and with this decision all but abdicated.4647 Trajan was formally bestowed with the title of Caesar and shared the consulship with Nerva in 98 in Cassius Dios words Thus Trajan became Caesar and later emperor although there were relatives of Nerva living. But Nerva did not esteem family relationship above the safety of the State nor was he less inclined to adopt Trajan because the latter was a Spaniard instead of an Italian or Italot inasmuch as no foreigner had previously held the Roman sovereignty for he believed in looking at a mans ability rather than at his nationality.48 Contrary to the view here popularized by Cassius Dio however Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor. Faced with a major crisis he desperately needed the support of a man who could restore his damaged reputation.45 The only candidate with sufficient military experience consular ancestry and connections was Trajan.38 Dios claim that Trajan was of nonItalic origins is also rejected by scholars it is known that Trajans roots went back to Umbria the same region where Nerva was born. Edward Gibbons famous assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found little support among some modern historians.49 Death and legacyedit Roman aureus struck under Trajan c. 115. The reverse commemorates both Trajans natural father Marcus Ulpius Traianus right and his adoptive father the Deified Nerva left. Caption IMP. TRAIANVS AVG. GER. DAC. P. M. TR. P. CONS. VI P. P.  DIVI NERVA ET TRAIANVS PAT. On 1 January 98 at the start of his fourth consulship Nerva suffered a stroke during a private audience.50 Shortly thereafter he was struck by a fever and died at his villa in the Gardens of Sallust on 27 January.56 He was deified by the Senate57 and his ashes were laid to rest in the Mausoleum of Augustus.58 He was the last Roman emperor to be interred there. Nerva was succeeded without incident by his adopted son Trajan who was greeted by the Roman populace with much enthusiasm. According to Pliny the Younger Trajan dedicated a temple in honour of Nerva59 yet no trace of it has ever been found nor was a commemorative series of coins for the Deified Nerva issued until ten years after his death. According to Cassius Dio however the Guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against Nerva Casperius Aelianus was dismissed upon Trajans accession.60 Due to the lack of written sources on this period much of Nervas life has remained obscure. The most substantial surviving account of the reign of Nerva was written by the 
3 rdcentury historian Cassius Dio. His Roman History which spans nearly a millennium from the arrival of Aeneas in Italy until the year 229 was composed more than one hundred years after Nerva had died. Further details are added by an abridged biography from the Epitome de Caesaribus a work attributed to the 
4 thcentury historian Aurelius Victor. A more comprehensive text presumed to describe the life of Nerva in closer detail is the Histories by the contemporary historian Tacitus. The Histories is an account of the history of Rome covering three decades from the suicide of emperor Nero in 69 until the death of Domitian in 96.citation needed However a substantial part of the work has been lost with only the first five books covering the Year of the Four Emperors remaining. In the introduction to his biography of Gnaeus Julius Agricola however Tacitus speaks highly of Nerva describing his reign as the dawn of a most happy age when Nerva Caesar blended things once irreconcilable sovereignty and freedom.61 The surviving histories speak equally positively of Nervas brief reign although none offer a substantial commentary on his policies. Both Cassius Dio and Aurelius Victor emphasize his wisdom and moderation2762 with Dio commending his decision to adopt Trajan as his heir.48 These views were later popularized by the 
18 thcentury historian Edward Gibbon in his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Gibbon considered Nerva the first of the Five Good Emperors five successive rulers under whom the Roman Empire was governed by absolute power under the guidance of wisdom and virtue from 96 until 180. Nevertheless even Gibbon notes that compared to his successors Nerva may have lacked the necessary qualifications for a successful reign Nerva had scarcely accepted the purple from the assassins of Domitian before he discovered that his feeble age was unable to stem the torrent of public disorders which had multiplied under the long tyranny of his predecessor. His mild disposition was respected by the good but the degenerate Romans required a more vigorous character whose justice should strike terror into the guilty.63 Modern history has expanded upon this sentiment characterizing Nerva as a wellintentioned but weak and ineffectual ruler. The Roman Senate enjoyed renewed liberties under his rule but Nervas mismanagement of the state finances and lack of authority over the army ultimately brought Rome near the edge of a significant crisis.30 The mutiny led by Casperius Aelianus was never intended as a coup but a calculated attempt to put pressure on the emperor.38 The adoption of Trajan expanded his power base with a respected reliable general as his successor. Murison concludes that Nervas real talents were in fact illsuited to the emperorship Nerva was it would seem the ultimate committee man. He was not apparently a great orator and one has the impression that he functioned better in small groups where his generally calm approach to problems will have impressed people. ... What is wellknown today however is that more often than not if the super committee man takes on an important administrative job the result is quite dreadful. Rome was indeed spared catastrophe but for all that nearcontemporary writers were careful about what they said Nervas administration was fairly inept. It would not be unfair to say that he was a textbook illustration of what nowadays is called the Peter Principle.64 His place in Roman history is therefore summarized as a necessary if tumultuous stopgap before the TrajanicAntonine dynasties.20 Even the only major public work completed during his reign the Forum of Nerva ultimately became known as the Forum Transitorium or transitional forum.65 Two modern statues which commemorate Nerva can be found in towns associated with him. There is an equestrian statue in Gloucester England a town which was founded in his honour. It is at the entrance to Southgate Street. There is also a statue at his alleged birthplace Narni in Italy at Cocceio Nerva street.6667 Unique late
