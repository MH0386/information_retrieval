Black is not in check and has no legal move since every square the king might move to is attacked by White.1 Stalemate is a situation in chess where the player whose turn it is to move is not in check and has no legal move. Stalemate results in a draw. During the endgame stalemate is a resource that can enable the player with the inferior position to draw the game rather than lose.2 In more complex positions stalemate is much rarer usually taking the form of a swindle that succeeds only if the superior side is inattentive.citation needed Stalemate is also a common theme in endgame studies and other chess problems. The outcome of a stalemate was standardized as a draw in the 
19 th century see  History of the stalemate rule below. Before this standardization its treatment varied widely including being deemed a win for the stalemating player a halfwin for that player or a loss for that player not being permitted and resulting in the stalemated player missing a turn. Stalemate rules vary in variants and other games of the chess family. This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves. Etymology and usageedit The first recorded use of stalemate is from 1765. It is a compounding of Middle English stale and mate meaning checkmate. Stale is probably derived from AngloFrench estale meaning standstill a cognate of stand and stall both ultimately derived from the ProtoIndoEuropean root sta. The first recorded use in a figurative sense is in 18
85.3 4 Stalemate has become a widely used metaphor for other situations where there is a conflict or contest between two parties such as war or political negotiations and neither side is able to achieve victory resulting in what is also called an impasse a deadlock or a Mexican standoff. Chess writers note that this usage is a misnomer because unlike in chess the situation is often a temporary one that is ultimately resolved even if it seems currently intractable.5678 The term stalemate is sometimes used incorrectly as a generic term for a draw in chess. While draws are common they are rarely the direct result of stalemate.9 Examplesedit Diagram 1 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Black to move is stalemated see King and pawn versus king endgame.

The bishop has no legal moves because it is pinned to the king by the rook. Diagram 3 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Black to move is stalemated see Queen versus pawn endgame.

Diagram 5 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Black to move is stalemated a deadlock. With Black to move Black is stalemated in diagrams 1 to 5. Stalemate is an important factor in the endgame  the endgame setup in diagram 1 for example quite frequently is relevant in play see King and pawn versus king endgame. The position in diagram 1 occurred in an 1898 game between Amos Burn and Harry Pillsbury10 and also in a 1925 game between Savielly Tartakower and Richard Rti.11 The same position except shifted to the efile occurred in a 2009 game between Gata Kamsky and Vladimir Kramnik.12 The position in diagram 3 is an example of a pawn drawing against a queen. Stalemates of this sort can often save a player from losing an apparently hopeless position see Queen versus pawn endgame. The position in diagram 5 is a special kind of stalemate in which no move is possible even if one ignores the need to avoid selfcheck. George P. Jelliss has called this type of stalemate a deadlock. Adding a White knight on f2 would produce a checklock a checkmate position where no moves are possible even if one ignores the need to avoid selfcheck. In general positions with no moves at all available even ignoring the need to avoid selfcheck are called locks.13 Examples from gamesedit Anand versus Kramnikedit Anand vs. Kramnik 2007 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Before 65...Kxf5 stalemate In this position from the game Viswanathan AnandVladimir Kramnik from the 2007 World Chess Championship14 Black played 65...Kxf5 stalemating White.15 Any other move by Black loses.

3 g7 An intentional stalemate occurred on the 1
24 th move of the fifth game of the 1978 World Championship match between Viktor Korchnoi and Anatoly Karpov.16 The game had been a theoretical draw for many moves.1718 Whites bishop is useless it cannot defend the queening square at a8 nor attack the black pawn on the light a
4 square. If the white king heads towards the black pawn the black king can move towards a8 and set up a fortress. The players were not on speaking terms however so neither would offer a draw by agreement. On his 1
24 th move White played 124.Bg7 delivering stalemate. Korchnoi said that it gave him pleasure to stalemate Karpov and that it was slightly humiliating.19 Until 2021 this was the longest game played in a World Chess Championship final match as well as the only World Championship game to end in stalemate before 20

In the game Ossip BernsteinVasily Smyslov21 first diagram Black can win by sacrificing the fpawn and using the king to support the bpawn.

Rd2 Bxd2  White was stalemated.26 More complex examplesedit Main article Desperado chess Although stalemate usually occurs in the endgame it can also occur with more pieces on the board. Outside of relatively simple endgame positions such as those above stalemate occurs rarely usually when the side with the superior position has overlooked the possibility of stalemate.27 This is typically realized by the inferior sides sacrifice of one or more pieces in order to force stalemate. A piece that is offered as a sacrifice to bring about stalemate is sometimes called a desperado.

Whites rook has been called the eternal rook. Capturing it results in stalemate but otherwise it stays on the seventh rank and checks Blacks king ad infinitum i.e. perpetual check.

Kd8 rightmost diagram Black is three pieces ahead but if White is allowed to take the bishop the two knights are insufficient to force checkmate. The only way to save the bishop is to move it resulting in stalemate. A similar idea occasionally enables the inferior side to save a draw in the ending of bishop knight and king versus lone king.

3.4 5 History of the stalemate ruleedit The stalemate rule has had a convoluted history.46 Although stalemate is universally recognized as a draw today that was not the case for much of the games history. In the forerunners to modern chess such as chaturanga delivering stalemate resulted in a loss.47 This was changed in shatranj however where stalemating was a win. This practice persisted in chess as played in early 
15 thcentury Spain.48 Lucena c. 1497 however treated stalemate as an inferior form of victory49 it won only half the stake in games played for money and this continued to be the case in Spain as late as 16
00.5 0 From about 1600 to 1800 the rule in England was that stalemate was a loss for the player administering it a rule that the eminent chess historian H. J. R. Murray believes may have been adopted from Russian chess.51 That rule disappeared in England before 1820 being replaced by the French and Italian rule that a stalemate was a drawn game.52 Throughout history a stalemate has at various times been A win for the stalemating player in 
10 th century Arabia53 and parts of medieval Europe.5455 A halfwin for the stalemating player. In a game played for stakes the stalemating player would win half the stake 
18 th century Spain.56 A win for the stalemated player in 
9 th century India57 
17 th century Russia58 on the Central Plain of Europe in the 
17 th century59 and 
17 th
18 th century England.6061 This rule continued to be published in Hoyles Games Improved as late as 18
66.6 263 Illegal. If White made a move that would stalemate Black he had to retract it and make a different move Eastern Asia until the early 
20 th century. Murray likewise wrote that in Hindustani chess and Parsi chess two of the three principal forms of chess played in India as of 191364 a player was not allowed to play a move that would stalemate the opponent.65 The same was true of Burmese chess another chess variant at the time of writing.66 Stalemate was not permitted in most of the Eastern Asiatic forms of the game specifically in Burma India Japan and Siam until early in the 
20 th century.67 The forfeiture of the stalemated players turn to move medieval France6869 although other medieval French sources treat stalemate as a draw.70 A draw. This was the rule in 
13 thcentury Italy71 and also stated in the German Cracow Poem 1422 that noted however that some players treated stalemate as equivalent to checkmate.72 This rule was ultimately adopted throughout Europe but not in England until the 
19 th century after being introduced there by Jacob Sarratt.737475 Proposed rule changeedit Periodically writers have argued that stalemate should again be made a win for the side causing the stalemate on the grounds that the goal of chess is conceptually to capture the king and checkmate merely ends it when this is inevitable.13 Grandmaster Larry Kaufman writes In my view calling stalemate a draw is totally illogical since it represents the ultimate zugzwang where any move would get your king taken.76 The British master T. H. Tylor argued in a 1940 article in the British Chess Magazine that the present rule treating stalemate as a draw is without historical foundation and irrational and primarily responsible for a vast percentage of draws and hence should be abolished.77 Years later Fred Reinfeld wrote When Tylor wrote his attack on the stalemate rule he released about his unhappy head a swarm of peevish maledictions that are still buzzing.78 Larry Evans calls the proposal to make stalemate a win for the stalemating player a crude proposal that ... would radically alter centuries of tradition and make chess boring.79 This rule change would cause a greater emphasis on material an extra pawn would be a greater advantage than it is today. a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Checklock a victory under the present rules but not if the goal were changed to capturing the king.13 However Kaufman tested the idea of scoring stalemates higher than draws with the chess engine Komodo and found that the impact is quite small because it is rare to be able to force stalemate but not checkmate while all king and pawn versus king endgames become wins when the pawn is protected except when the attacking king is trapped in front of its own rook pawn this does not turn out to be common enough. The problem is that king and lone minor piece against king cannot force stalemate in general. Emanuel Lasker and Richard Rti proposed that both stalemate and king and minor versus king with the minor piece side to move should give  points to the superior side this would effectively restore not only the old stalemate rule but also the old bare king rule. Kaufman and correspondence grandmaster Arno Nickel have proposed going even further and giving only  point as well to the side that brings about a threefold repetition which likewise has precedents in xiangqi shogi and Go. According to his tests with Komodo chess at the level of a human World Championship match would have a draw rate of 
65.6  scoring stalemate as  reduces the draw rate to 
63.4  scoring stalemate and bare king as  brings it to 
55.9  and scoring stalemate bare king and threefold repetition as  brings it all the way down to 
22.6 . The same reduction of draws would occur if stalemate bare king and threefold repetition were scored as 10 instead of  but the point of the  scoring is to allow the weaker side to still benefit from avoiding checkmate while giving the stronger side something to play for even when checkmate cannot be attained.80 Jelliss has suggested that under the logic that stalemate should be a win since any move would get the king taken checklock should be a draw. In a checklock position no forward play is possible even if exposing the king to check is valid so the king cannot get captured. The same logic would apply to deadlock.13 Effect on endgame theoryedit If stalemate were a loss for the player unable to move the outcome of some endgames would be affected.33 In some situations the superior side can force stalemate but not checkmate.

In all other cases either the pawn can be promoted or the defending king can be forced into a stalemate Fine  Benko 2003810 see diagram 2 below. An unusual position is given to the right it is a draw under orthodox rules but if stalemate is deemed to be a win then Black to play wins by 1...Rh8 Taking the rook gets White stalemated after 2.Kxh8 Kf7 or 2...Kf8 and if White refuses the sacrifice Black can force White to abandon the pawn with 2.Kg6 Kf8 3.Kh6 Kf7 or 2.Kh6 Kf7 leaving a basic checkmate.81 Two knights and a king can force stalemate against a lone king Hooper  Whyld 199232 See Two knights endgame. A rook pawn plus a bishop on the color opposite the pawns queening square would be a win instead of a draw because the defending king can be forced into stalemate Fine  Benko 2003133 see diagram 2 below. See Wrong rook pawn. A king and rook versus a king and bishop would be a win for the side with the rook because the superior side can force stalemate Fine  Benko 200345960 see diagram 3 below. The same is not true for a rook versus knight. If the defending king is cornered a single bishop or knight may be able to stalemate the king although these cannot be forced in general.33 The defensive drawing techniques with a bishop pawn or rook pawn on the seventh rank with its king nearby versus a queen would not work because they rely on stalemate Fine  Benko 200352728. See Queen versus pawn endgame. Positions such as the Saavedra position which would normally require an underpromotion due to the fact that a queen would stalemate the opponent no longer require an underpromotion. In fact underpromotion to rook or bishop would no longer be necessary in chess.

Many regional variants as well some variants of Western chess have adopted their own rules on how to treat the stalemated player. In chaturanga which is widely considered to be the common ancestor of all variants of chess a stalemate was a win for the stalemated player.8283 Around the 
7 th century this game was adopted in the Middle East as shatranj with very similar rules to its predecessor however the stalemate rule was changed to its exact opposite i.e. it was a win for the player delivering the stalemate.84 This game was in turn introduced to the Western world where it would eventually evolve to modernday Western chess although the stalemate rule for Western chess was not standardized as a draw until the 
19 th century see history of the rule. Modern Asian variantsedit Chaturanga also evolved into several other games in various regions of Asia all of which have varying rules on stalemating In makruk Thai chess a stalemate results in a draw like in Western chess.85 In shogi Japanese chess and the majority of its variants a stalemate is a win for the player delivering the stalemate.86 However in shogi and in any variant of the game that features drops stalemates are extremely rare due to the fact that no piece ever goes entirely out of play. In xiangqi Chinese chess it results in an immediate loss for the stalemated player like in shogi and there is no explicit distinction between it and checkmate.87 In janggi Korean chess uniquely among modern chess variants players are allowed to pass their turn at any time. Consequently there are no stalemates only positions in which the only legal move is to pass.88 In fact Korean chess does not even have draws and is the only competitively played version of chess where that is the case under the official South Korean tournament rules in positions that would otherwise be draws points are tallied up for the pieces and pawns remaining on the board with the player moving second being given 
1.5  points to compensate for the firstmove advantage. Since every piece and pawn is given an integer number of points the result can never be a draw.89 In sittuyin MyanmarBurmese chess stalemates are avoided altogether as delivering them is illegal. Players are not allowed to leave the opponent with no legal moves without putting the king into check.90 In shatar Mongolian chess stalemate is a loss for the stalemated player like in xiangqi and shogi. JeanLouis Cazaux and Rick Knowlton explain it as follows the loss of liberty is considered equal to death by the Mongolian nomadic culture.91 Western chess variantsedit The majority of variants of Western chess do not specify any alterations to the rule of stalemate. There are some variants however where the rule is specified to differ from that of standard chess In losing chess the stalemate rule varies depending on the version being played.92 According to the international rules a stalemate is simply a win for the stalemated player. The Free Internet Chess Server however grants a win to the player with fewer pieces remaining on the board regardless of who delivered the stalemate if both players have the same number of pieces it is a draw.93 There is also a joint FICSinternational rule according to which a stalemate is only a win if both sources agree that it is a win i.e. it counts as a win for the stalemated player if that player also happens to have fewer pieces remaining in all other cases it is a draw. In Gliskis hexagonal chess stalemate is neither a draw nor a full win. Instead in tournament games the player who delivers the stalemate earns  point while the stalemated player receives  point.94 It is unknown whether a stalemate should be considered a draw or a win in a friendly game.
