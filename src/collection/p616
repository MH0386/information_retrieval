Dynasty Fifth Dynasty Shepseskare or Shepseskara Egyptian for Noble is the Soul of Ra15 was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh the fourth or fifth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty 24942345 BC during the Old Kingdom period. Shepseskare lived in the mid
25 th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction.16 Following historical sources Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne1718 making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskares reign lasted only a few months at the most after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskares unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verners arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskares relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a shortlived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded. Attestationsedit Contemporaneous sourcesedit Shepseskare was a king of Ancient Egypt the fourth19 or fifth3 ruler of the Fifth Dynasty. Egypt was unified at the time with its capital located at Memphis.20 Shepseskare is the leastknown king of the Fifth Dynasty as very few artefacts dating to his reign have survived to this day. Only two cylinder seals of Shepseskare are known one made of bronze bears Shepseskares Horus name and was uncovered in the ruins of Memphis in the early 
20 th century.b1 The second seal of unknown provenance is made of black serpentine and reads Shepseskare beloved of the gods Shepseskare beloved of Hathor.
21 c Beyond these two seals the only surviving artefacts attributable to Shepseskare are five fragments of seal impressions on clay from Abusir2223 and six further fragments discovered in the mortuary temple and Sanctuary of the Knife of the Pyramid of Neferefre also in Abusir.2425 These fragments probably come from three different seals and were most likely placed on the doors of magazine rooms in the temple.26 In 2022 a further clay seal impression of Shepseskare was uncovered in the immediate vicinity of Nyuserres Abusir sun temple.27 Drawing by Flinders Petrie of a scarab seal reading Shepeskare sic but probably dating to the Saite period.28 Finally there is a single scarab seal reading Shepeskare sic that the Egyptologist Flinders Petrie attributed to Shepseskare at the end of the 
19 th century.29 Modern scholars doubt this attribution and rather believe the scarab to be a work of the much later Saite period 685525 BC executed in archaic style.2223 Equally the scarab could belong to Gemenefkhonsbak Shepeskare an obscure kinglet of Tanis during the 
25 th Dynasty 760656 BC.2223 Historical sourcesedit The only22 ancient Egyptian king list mentioning Shepseskare is the Saqqara Tablet on the 
28 th entry.30 The tablet was inscribed during the reign of Ramesses II 12791213 BC around 1200 years after Shepseskares lifetime and records the dynastic succession Neferikare  Shepseskare  Neferkhare a variant name of Neferefre.31 Shepseskare is completely absent from another king list dating to the same period the Abydos king list written during the reign of Seti I 12941279 BC. He is also absent from the Turin canon reign of Ramses II although in this case a lacuna affects the papyrus on which the list is written at the place where Shepseskare and Neferefres names should have been.
32 d Of the two entries concerning Shepseskare and Neferefre on the king list only one reign length is still legible and it has been variously read as one year34 eleven years35 or one to four months.33 The damaged state of the papyrus also makes it impossible to decide safely whose reign length this is.22 Shepseskare was also likely mentioned in the Aegyptiaca a history of Egypt written in the third century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II 283246 BC by the Egyptian priest Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. Africanus relates that the Aegyptiaca mentioned the succession Nefercheres  Sisires  Cheres for the mid Fifth Dynasty. Nefercheres and Cheres are believed to be the hellenized forms for Neferirkare and Neferkhare that is Neferefre respectively. Thus Sisires is traditionally believed to be the Greek name of Shepseskare making Manethos reconstruction of the Fifth Dynasty in good agreement with the Saqqara tablet.31 Furthermore according to Africanus Manetho credits Sisires with seven years of reign while other sources report Manethos figure as nine years.3 Reignedit Chronological positionedit Map of the necropolis of Abusir.36 The unfinished pyramid is attributed to Shepseskare.37 The red line points to Heliopolis.38 Both the relative chronological position and absolute dates of Shepseskares reign are uncertain. The Saqqara Tablet records Shepseskare as the successor of Neferirkare Kakai and the predecessor of Neferefre which became the traditional opinion among Egyptologists.3 Following discoveries in the early 19
80 s the Czech Egyptologist Miroslav Verner advocates the hypothesis that Shepseskare succeeded rather than preceded Neferefre.39 In support of this hypothesis Verner first emphasizes the presence of several clay seal impressions bearing Shepseskares Horus name Sekhemkaw meaning He whose apparitions are powerful in the oldest part of Nefereres mortuary temple which was not built until Neferefres death.4041 This appears to suggest that Shepseskare ruled afterrather than beforeNeferefre.e26 Verners second argument concerns the alignment of pyramids of Sahure Neferirkare Kakai and Neferefre they form a line pointing to Heliopolis just as the three pyramids of Giza do.
38 f In contrast Shepseskares unfinished pyramid does not fall on the line to Heliopolis which strongly suggests that Neferefres pyramid had already been in place when Shepseskare started his.33 Finally Verner observes that Neferefre is known to have been Neferirkares eldest son33 and around 20 years old42 when his father died so that he was in optimal position to inherit the throne. Shepseskare thus most likely took the throne after Neferefre. As Verner notes while Shepseskare is noted as the immediate predecessor of Neferefre in the Saqqara tablet this slight discrepancy can ... be attributed to the political disorders of the time and its dynastic disputes.41 Durationedit In two articles published in 2000 and 20014344 Verner argues that contrary to what Manetho indicates Shepseskare must have reigned for a couple of months at the most a hypothesis already proposed by the French Egyptologist Nicolas Grimal in 19
88.4 5 Verners conclusion is based on the archeological record in particular Shepseskares intended pyramid at Abusir. Verner emphasizes that the progress of the pyramid which is unfinished was interrupted and corresponds to the work of several weeks perhaps no more than one or two months. In fact the place was merely leveled and the excavation of the pit for the construction of the underground funerary apartment had only commenced. Moreover the owner of the building obviously wanted to demonstrate by his choice of place halfway between Sahures pyramid and the sun temple of Userkaf his relationship to either Sahure or Userkaf. Theoretically only two kings of the Fifth Dynasty whose pyramids had not yet been identified can be taken into consideration  Shepseskara or Menkauhor. However according to a number of contemporaneous documents Menkauhor ... probably completed his pyramid elsewhere in North Saqqara or Dahshur. Shepseskara therefore seems to be the likelier owner of the unfinished platform for a pyramid in North Abusir. Anyway the builder of the platform viz. Shepseskare must have reigned for a very short time.46 The rediscovery in 2008 of the Headless Pyramid in Saqqara and its subsequent attribution to Menkauhor Kaiu by the excavators under the direction of Zahi Hawass confirms Verners attribution of the unfinished pyramid of Abusir to Shepseskare.4748 Unlike the other kings of the Fifth Dynasty Shepseskares name appears neither in the personal names of people of the time nor in the names of funerary estates.4950 He is also absent from the titles and biographies of state officials.250 For example the stela of the Fifth Dynasty official KhauPtah lists an uninterrupted sequence of kings whom he served under namely Sahure Neferirkare Neferefre and Nyuserre.5152 The omission of Shepseskare be it between Neferirkare and Neferefre or between Neferefre and Nyuserre5152 indicates that his reign must have been very short.40 Since Manethos Aegyptiaca dates to the third century BC KhauPtahs contemporary account can be regarded as a more accurate indication of the political situation during the Fifth Dynasty. Verners arguments together with the scarcity of artefacts attributable to Shepseskare have now convinced many Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung that Shepseskares reign was indeed ephemeral.34 Familyedit In view of the scarcity of sources concerning Shepseskare nothing is known for certain about his relation to his predecessors. He was most likely a member of the royal family4253 although the possibility that he was a usurper unrelated to his predecessors cannot be totally excluded.54 Silke Roth has proposed that Shepseskare was a son of Neferirkare Kakai and a brother of both Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini.55 Instead Verner has proposed that Shepseskare was a son of Sahure who managed to briefly seize power after the premature death of Neferefre.46 This would explain the proximity of Shepseskares unfinished pyramid to that of Sahure. Lending credence to this theory is the discovery by Verner and Tarek El Awady in 2005 of reliefs from the causeway of Sahures pyramid complex showing him his wife Meretnebty and their two sons Ranefer and Netjerirenre.56 The relief gives both sons the title of kings eldest son indicating that they were possibly twins. The relief further indicates that Ranefer took the throne as Neferirkare king of Upper and Lower Egypt.56 Verner and Awady thus speculate that while Ranefer and his son Neferefre became kings Netjerirenre could have attempted to seize the throne at the death of the latter. In this hypothesis Shepseskare would be the throne name of Netjerirenre.57 Verner had however himself written in 1997 that Shepseskare could equally be a son of Shepseskaf last pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty or of Userkaf or Neferirkare Kakai as Roth suggested so few are the actual evidences pertaining to the problem that all possibilities are just speculations.58 In yet another hypothesis Jaromr Krej believes that Shepseskare was Neferefres son.59 Shepseskares reign may have been cut short by his unexpected death or his claim to the throne could have been thwarted by Nyuserre Ini Neferefres younger brother and the younger son of King Neferirkare and Queen Khentkaus II. Khentkaus IIs pivotal role in Nyuserres eventual accession to the throne might explain her high esteem in Egyptian folklore and the additional enlargement and upgrading of her mortuary temple by Nyuserre.60 Nyuserre also seemed to have been favored by powerful courtiers and officials foremost among whom was Ptahshepses who would become Nyuserres soninlaw and vizier.61 Building activitiesedit Pyramidedit An unfinished pyramid located in north Abusir between the sun temple of Userkaf and the Pyramid of Sahure is believed to belong to Shepseskare. The structure was discovered in 1980 by a Czechoslovakian archaeological team led by Miroslav Verner62 and seems to have been abandoned after no more than a few weeks or months of work. A square area of roughly 100 m2 1100 sq ft was leveled and the digging of a Tshaped ditch was just started in its center.63 This ditch was to be left open during the pyramid construction to allow for simultaneous works on the pyramid filling and its substructures. This construction technique is common to all pyramids of the Fifth Dynasty and can directly be seen in the case of the Pyramid of Neferefre which was also left unfinished.63 This technique as well as the location of the unfinished pyramid in the royal necropolis of the Fifth Dynasty indicates that it belonged in all likeliness to Shepseskare63 the pyramids of the other kings of the dynasty being already known. If finished according to the established pattern the pyramid would have reached 73 m 240 ft high similar to the Pyramid of Neferirkare.64 Analyzing the fragments of clay seals bearing Shepeseskares name the Swiss Egyptologist Peter Kaplony has proposed that the ancient name of Shepseskares pyramid could be reconstructed as Rsjpssk
3 R reading ResjShespeskare and meaning The awakening of Shepseskare.65 Verner rejects this hypothesis and he contests the reading of certain signs and their interpretation as the name of a pyramid.6667 Sun templeedit Kaplony has proposed that Shepseskare started to build a sun temple named tpjbR reading Hotepibre and meaning Satisfied is the heart of Ra.68 Although all the kings of the early to midFifth Dynasty from Userkaf to Menkauhor Kaiu did build sun temples Verner regards Kaplonys hypothesis as sheer speculation since it is based on the tentative reconstruction of a single clay seal.5067 Verner first argues that this seal is not inscribed with Shepseskares name but rather bears traces of a Horus name which could equally well be that of Djedkare Isesi.g69 Second Verner notes that the name of a sun temple is rarely found with that of the king who built it more often it is found with the name of another king during whose reign the seal was made.69 Finally he doubts that the sign reading tp Hotep is really part of the name of a sun temple. Instead he believes it is more probable that the seal either refers to the sun temple of Neferirkare named StjbR.w that is Setibraw or to that of Nyuserre which was called spjbR Shesepibre.69 Mortuary temple of Neferefreedit It is possible that Shepseskare continued the construction of the funerary complex of his predecessor.3 As Neferefre had died after a short reign his pyramid complex was far from finished and neither the burial chamber nor the mortuary temple had been built.2 The planned pyramid was thus hastily2 changed into a square mastaba representing a stylized primeval hill2 and the accompanying mortuary temple was completed during the reign of Nyuserre.70 The presence of seals of Shepseskare in the oldest part of Neferefres mortuary temple could indicate that the former also undertook construction works there.3 The evidence for such works is uncertain these seals could have been placed on boxes which were later moved into the magazine rooms of the temple. For example seals of Userkaf Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai were also found in the temple while these three pharaohs died before Neferefres reign.71 Notesedit  Proposed dates for Shepseskares reign 24822475 BC10 24672460 BC11 24632456 BC12 24552448 BC1367 24382431 BC814 2403 BC.4  The seal is now in the Cairo Museum under the catalog number JE 45041.  The seal is now in the G. Mikhailides collection.  The lacuna is on the third column entries 20 and 
21.3 3 Because of the lacuna it cannot be ascertained whether the canon listed Shepseskare before or after Neferefre.  Three facts are mentioned concerning these seals 1 they were found in a temple that was built only after Neferefres death i.e. the seals too were placed there after Neferefres death. 2 Such seals would exist only if Shepseskares was or had already been king at the time of their deposition in Neferefres temple. 3 The seals were found in the oldest part of Neferefres temple but the temple is known to have been completed by Nyuserre. The simplest explanation that Verner has proposed for these facts is that Shepseskare lived after and not before Neferefre and that he placed offerings in boxes bearing the seals in Neferefres temple which was then very small being unfinished. In other words Verner sees Shespeskare as building a small part of Neferefres temple filling it with offering bearing his seals then dying only to be succeeded by Nyuserre who completed the temple.  Heliopolis housed the main temple of Ra which was the most important religious center in the country at the time.38 The temple was visible from both Abusir and Giza42 and was probably located where the lines from the Abusir and Giza necropolises intersected.38  The Horus name of Djedkare Isesi is Djedkhau.
