The concept of a Second Intermediate Period generally includes the 
13 th through to the 
17 th dynasties however there is no universal agreement in Egyptology about how to define the period.2 It is best known as the period when the Hyksos people of West Asia established the 
15 th Dynasty and ruled from Avaris which according to Manethos Aegyptiaca was founded by a king by the name of Salitis.3 The settling of these people may have occurred peacefully although later recounts of Manetho portray the Hyksos as violent conquerors and oppressors of Egypt.4 The Turin King List from the time of Ramesses II remains the primary source for understanding the chronology and political history of the Second Intermediate Period along with studying the typology of scarabs beetleshaped amulets massproduced in Ancient Egypt and often inscribed with the names of rulers.5 Collapse of the Middle Kingdomedit The 
12 th Dynasty of Egypt ended in the late 
19 th century BC with the death of Queen Sobekneferu.6 She had no heirs causing the dynasty to come to an abrupt end and with it the most prosperous era of the Middle Kingdom it was succeeded by the much weaker 
13 th Dynasty. According to the Byzantine chronicler George Syncellus all three sources of the translated king list of Africanus Eusebius and the Armenian of Eusebius state that the 
13 th Dynasty had sixty kings that ruled and lived in Dioplus for roughly 453 years.7 Retaining the seat of the 
12 th Dynasty the 
13 th Dynasty c. 1773  1650 BC ruled from Itjtawy SeizeroftheTwoLands for most of its existence. The pyramid of Khendjer is the only pyramid known to have been completed during the 
13 th Dynasty Upper part of a statue of pharaoh Khendjer from his pyramid complex Migration to Thebesedit The 
13 th Dynasty switched to Thebes in the far south possibly in the reign of Merneferre Ay.1123 Daphna Ben Tor believes that this event was triggered by the invasion of the eastern Delta and the Memphite region by Canaanite rulers who had their own culture a variant of the contemporary late Palestinian Middle Bronze Age culture of the southern Levant.8 For some authors this marks the end of the Middle Kingdom and the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period.9 This analysis is rejected by Ryholt and Baker however who note that the stele of Seheqenre Sankhptahi reigning toward the end of the dynasty strongly suggests that he reigned over Memphis. The stele is of unknown provenance.1011 Though the 
13 th Dynasty may have controlled Upper Egypt the 
14 th Dynasty ruled Lower Egypt and both houses agreed to coexist allowing trade.12 Evidently the rulers had trouble with securing power within their territory being replaced in rapid fashion but other factors like famine may have played a part.13 The eventual collapse of the 
13 th Dynasty became an opening for two smaller dynasties to take control of Egypt.13 Transitional periodedit Similar to the First Intermediate Period of Egypt the Second Intermediate Period was dynamic time in which rule of Egypt was roughly divided between rival power bases in Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt each controlling a portion of land. 
14 th Dynastyedit Main article Fourteenth Dynasty of Egypt The 
13 th Dynasty proved unable to hold on to the entire territory of Egypt and a provincial ruling family located in the Nile Delta broke away from the central authority to form the 
14 th Dynasty c.17001650 BC. According to Syncellus all three sources agree that the 
14 th Dynasty had seventysix kings and their court was located in Xois now modern day Sakha although they provide different numbers of years ruled. Africanus stated the dynasty reigned for 184 years while the Armenian version of Eusebius states 484 years. Eusebius states the same as Africanus but in another copy the same number as the Armenian version.714 The precise borders of the 
14 th Dynasty state are not known due to the general scarcity of its monuments. In his study of the Second Intermediate Period Kim Ryholt concludes that the territory directly controlled by the 
14 th Dynasty roughly consisted of the Nile Delta with borders located near Athribis in the western Delta and Bubastis in the east.15 Most modern Egyptologists share the view that Avaris  rather than Xois  was the 
14 th Dynastys seat of power.16 Contested rulers proposed by Ryholt as the first five rulers of the dynasty are commonly identified as being of Canaanite Semitic descent based on their names. His conclusions about their chronological position within the period are contested in Ben Tors study.1718 The contested rulers with the translation of their nomens are Yakbim Sekhaenre Yakbim means the goddess Aya is a rock Yaammu Nubwoserre Yaammu means where is the uncle Qareh Khawoserre Qareh means the bald one Ammu Aahotepre Ammu could mean the Asiatic Sheshi Maaibre Sheshi is a Semitic name192021 The most attested noncontested ruler of the dynasty Nehesy Aasehre left his name on two monuments at Avaris. His name means the Nubian. According to Ryholt he was the son and direct successor of the pharaoh Sheshi with a Nubian Queen named Tati.18 The 
14 th Dynasty saw great success during their early years but like the late 
13 th Dynasty the rulers were replaced in rapid succession. The 
14 th Dynasty was overthrown by the Hyksos.14 
15 th Dynastyedit Main articles Fifteenth Dynasty of Egypt and Hyksos The Hyksos established their own dynasty in Egypt the 
15 th Dynasty c.1650 to 1550 BC.1123 The first king of the 
15 th Dynasty Salitis described as a Hyksos wswt a shepherd according to Africanus led his people into an occupation of the Nile Delta area and settled his capital at Avaris. According to Manetho Salitis is believed to have conquered the entirety of Egypt however it is more likely that his rule did not extend beyond Lower Egypt. Salitis may be equated to a poorly known king named Sharek and possibly even Sheshi the most attested ruler of the Second Intermediate Period.2223 The Turin King list indicates that there were six Hyksos kings with an obscure Khamudi listed as the final king of the 
15 th Dynasty.24 The 
15 th Dynasty of Egypt ruled from Avaris but did not control the entire land leaving some of northern Upper Egypt under the control of both the Abydos Dynasty and the early 
16 th Dynasty. The 
16 th Dynasty was ruled not by the Hyksos themselves but the Thebans.24 Fifteenth Dynasty Name Image Dates and comments Salitis Unattested Mentioned by Manetho as first king of the dynasty currently unidentified with any known archaeologically attested person. Ruled for 19 years according to Manetho as quoted by Josephus. Semqen Mentioned on the Turin king list. According to Ryholt he was an early Hyksos ruler possibly the first king of the dynasty von Beckerath assigns him to the 
16 th dynasty.25 Aperanat Mentioned on the Turin king list. According to Ryholt he was an early Hyksos ruler possibly the second king of the dynasty von Beckerath assigns him to the 
16 th dynasty.25 Khyan Ruled 10 years.26 Yanassi Khyans eldest son possibly at the origin of the mention of a king Iannas in Manethos Aegyptiaca SakirHar Named as an Hyksos king on a doorjamb found at Avaris. Regnal order uncertain. Apophis c. 15901550 BC Ruled 40 years.26 Khamudi c. 15501540 BC It is debated if the movement of the Hyksos was a military invasion or a mass migration of Asiatics from Palestine.271127128 The settling of Canaanite populations may have occurred peacefully in the wake of the disintegration of the 
14 th Dynasty.28294 A recent Strontium isotope analysis also dismissed the invasion model in favor of a migration one. Contrary to the model of a foreign invasion the study didnt find more males moving into the region but instead found a sex bias towards females with a high proportion 77 being nonlocals.3031 Abydos Dynastyedit Main article Abydos Dynasty Possible extent of power of the Abydos Dynasty c. 1650 BC  1600 BC ruling from Abydos Egypt The Abydos Dynasty c. 1640 to 1620 BC.32 may have been a shortlived local dynasty ruling over part of Upper Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period in Ancient Egypt and was contemporary with the 
15 th and 
16 th dynasties. The Abydos Dynasty stayed rather small with rulership over just Abydos or Thinis.32 Very little is known about the Abydos dynasty since it was a very shortlived though we do have some king names that appear in Turin king list but it not in any other sources. The dynasty tentatively includes four rulers Wepwawetemsaf Pantjeny Snaaib and Senebkay.32 The Abydos Dynasty ceased when the Hyksos expanded into Upper Egypt. 
16 th Dynastyedit Main article Sixteenth Dynasty of Egypt The 
16 th Dynasty c. 16501580 BC ruled the Theban region in Upper Egypt. Of the two chief versions of Manethos Aegyptiaca the 
16 th Dynasty is described by the more reliable Africanus supported by Syncellus as shepherd Hyksos kings but by Eusebius as Theban.7 The continuing war against the 
15 th Dynasty dominated the shortlived 
16 th Dynasty. The armies of the 
15 th Dynasty winning town after town from their southern enemies continually encroached on 
16 th Dynasty territory eventually threatening and then conquering Thebes itself. Famine which had plagued Upper Egypt during the late 
13 th Dynasty and the 
14 th Dynasty also blighted the 
16 th Dynasty most evidently during and after the reign of Neferhotep III. The end of the 
16 th Dynasty came after relentless military pressure by the succeeding 
15 th Dynasty after many attempts with evidence of Nebiryraw Is own personal seals being found in the Hyksos territory. Sometime around 1580 BC the 
16 th Dynasty collapsed after being conquered by King Khyan of the Hyksos 
15 th Dynasty.33 
17 th Dynastyedit Main article Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt The 
17 th Dynasty c.15711540 BC34 was established by the Thebans quickly after the fall of the 
16 th. The details of the overthrow of the Hyksos in Thebes are unclear.34 Sources such as Africanus and Eusebius indicate that the 
16 th Dynasty comprised shepherd kings like the 
15 th Dynasty but also Theban kings too.7 The 
17 th Dynasty would also see four different ruling families whose last king did not have a male heir to the throne. Subsequently other powerful families established kings having short reigns.34 The 
17 th Dynasty maintained a shortlived peace with the 
15 th Dynasty which ended with the start of the reign of Seqenenre c. 15491545 BC who started a series of wars against the Hyksos. King Kamose c. 15451540 BC continued the war against the Hyksos as a whole but his brother Ahmose I would be the king to deal the final blow he thus became the first king of the New Kingdom 
18 th Dynasty.34 Pharaoh Ahmose I ruled c. 15491524 BC slaying a probable Hyksos. Detail of a ceremonial axe in the name of Ahmose I treasure of Queen Ahhotep II. Inscription Ahmose beloved of the War God Montu. Luxor Museum35363738 Reunificationedit At the end of the Second Intermediate period the 
18 th Dynasty came to power in Egypt. The first king of the 
18 th Dynasty Ahmose completed the expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt and consolidated his rule over the land unifying Upper and Lower Egypt. With that Ahmose ushered in a new period of prosperity the New Kingdom.39 Galleryedit Depiction of an Asiatic Hyksos official with the distinctive mushroom headed hairstyle40 The 
15 th Dynasty ruled Lower Egypt from Avaris for a hundred years.
