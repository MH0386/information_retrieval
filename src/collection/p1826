Generally considered the most important king in the history of Sparta Agesilaus was the main actor during the period of Spartan hegemony that followed the Peloponnesian War 431404 BC. Although brave in combat Agesilaus lacked the diplomatic skills to preserve Spartas position especially against the rising power of Thebes which reduced Sparta to a secondary power after its victory at Leuctra in 371 BC. Despite the traditional secrecy fostered by the Spartiates the reign of Agesilaus is particularly wellknown thanks to the works of his friend Xenophon who wrote a large history of Greece the Hellenica covering the years 411 to 362 BC therefore extensively dealing with Agesilaus rule. Xenophon furthermore composed a panegyric biography of his friend perhaps to clean his memory from the criticisms voiced against him. Another historical traditionmuch more hostile to Agesilaus than Xenophons writingshas been preserved in the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia and later continued by Diodorus of Sicily. Moreover Plutarch wrote a biography of Agesilaus in his Parallel Lives which contains many elements deliberately omitted by Xenophon. Early lifeedit Youthedit Agesilaus father was King Archidamos II r. 469427 who belonged to the Eurypontid dynasty one of the two royal families of Sparta. Archidamos already had a son from a first marriage with Lampito his own stepaunt named Agis.12 After the death of Lampito Archidamos remarried in the early 4
40 s with Eupolia daughter of Melesippidas whose name indicates an aristocratic status.34 The dates of Agesilaus birth death and reign are disputed. The only secured information is that he was 84 at his death. The majority opinion is to date his birth to 44545678 but a minority of scholars move it a bit later c.4
42.9 10 Most of the other dates of Agesilaus are similarly disputed with the minority moving them about two years later than the majority.i Agesilaus also had a sister named Kyniska the first woman in ancient history to achieve an Olympic victory.1112 The name Agesilaus was rare and harks back to Agesilaus I one of the earliest kings of Sparta.13 Agesilaus was born lame a fact that should have cost him his life since in Sparta deformed babies were thrown into a chasm.14 As he was not heirapparent he might have received some leniency from the tribal elders who examined male infants14 or perhaps the first effects of the demographic decline of Sparta were already felt at the time and only the most severely impaired babies were killed.1516 Starting at the age of 7 Agesilaus had to go through the rigorous education system of Sparta called the agoge.1718 Despite his disability he brilliantly completed the training14 which massively enhanced his prestige especially after he became king.19 Indeed as heirsapparent were exempted of the agoge few Spartan kings had gone through the same training as the citizens20 another notable exception was Leonidas the embodiment of the heroking.21 Between 433 and 428 Agesilaus also became the younger lover of Lysander an aristocrat from the circle of Archidamos whose family had some influence in Libya.2223 Spartan princeedit Little is known of Agesilaus adult life before his reign principally because Xenophonhis friend and main biographeronly wrote about his reign.24 Due to his special status Agesilaus likely became a member of the Krypteia an elite corps of young Spartans going undercover in Spartan territory to kill some helots deemed dangerous.25 Once he turned 20 and became a full citizen Agesilaus was elected to a common mess presumably that of his elder halfbrother Agis II who had become king in 427 of which Lysander was perhaps a member.26 Agesilaus probably served during the Peloponnesian War 431404 against Athens likely at the Battle of Mantinea in 4
18.2 7 Agesilaus married Kleora at some point between 408 and 4
00.2 8 Despite the influence she apparently had on her husband she is mostly unknown. Her father was Aristomenidas an influential noble with connections in Thebes.29 Thanks to three treaties signed with Persia in 412411 Sparta received funding from the Persians which it used to build a fleet that ultimately defeated Athens.30 This fleet was essentially led by Lysander whose success gave him an enormous influence in the Greek cities of Asia as well as in Sparta where he even schemed to become king.3132 In 403 the two kings Agis and Pausanias acted together to relieve him from his command.33 Reignedit Accession to the throne 400398 BCedit Agis II died while returning from Delphi between 400 and 398.ii After his funeral Agesilaus contested the claim of Leotychidas the son of Agis II using the widespread belief in Sparta that Leotychidas was an illegitimate son of Alcibiadesa famous Athenian statesman and nephew of Pericles who had gone into exile in Sparta during the Peloponnesian War and then seduced the queen. The rumours were strengthened by the fact that even Agis only recognised Leotychidas as his son on his deathbed.3637 Diopeithes a supporter of Leotychidas however quoted an old oracle telling that a Spartan king could not be lame thus refuting Agesilaus claim but Lysander cunningly returned the objection by saying that the oracle had to be understood figuratively. The lameness warned against by the oracle would therefore refer to the doubt on Leotychidas paternity and this reasoning won the argument.3839 The role of Lysander in the accession of Agesilaus has been debated among historians principally because Plutarch makes him the main instigator of the plot while Xenophon downplays Lysanders influence.4041 Lysander doubtless supported Agesilaus accession because he hoped that the new king would in return help him to regain the importance that he lost in 4
03.4 2 Conspiracy of Cinadon 399 BCedit The Conspiracy of Cinadon took place during the first year of Agesilaus reign in the summer of 3
99.4 3 Cinadon was a hypomeion a Spartan who had lost his citizen status presumably because he could not afford the price of the collective messone of the main reasons for the dwindling number of Spartan citizens in the Classical Era called oliganthropia.444546 It is probable that the vast influx of wealth coming to the city after its victory against Athens in 404 triggered inflation in Sparta which impoverished many citizens with a fixed income like Cinadon and caused their downgrade.47 Therefore the purpose of the plot was likely to restore the status of these disfranchised citizens.48 However the plot was uncovered and Cinadon and its leaders executedprobably with the active participation of Agesilaus49 but no further action was taken to solve the social crisis at the origin of the conspiracy. The failure of Agesilaus to acknowledge the critical problem suffered by Sparta at the time has been criticised by modern historians.5051 Invasion of Asia Minor 396394 BCedit According to the treaties signed in 412 and 411 between Sparta and the Persian Empire the latter became the overlord of the Greek citystates of Asia Minor.5253 In 401 these cities and Sparta supported the bid of Cyrus the Younger the Persian Emperors younger son and a good friend of Lysander against his elder brother the new emperor Artaxerxes II who nevertheless defeated Cyrus at Cunaxa.54 As a result Sparta remained at war with Artaxerxes and supported the Greek cities of Asia which fought against Tissaphernes the satrap of Lydia and Caria.55 In 397 Lysander engineered a large expedition in Asia headed by Agesilaus likely to recover the influence he had over the Asian cities at the end of the Peloponnesian War.5657 In order to win the approval of the Spartan assembly Lysander built an army with only 30 Spartan citizens so the risk would be limited the bulk of the army consisted of 2000 neodamodes freed helots and 6000 Greek allies.5859 In addition Agesilaus obtained the support of the oracles of Zeus at Olympia and Apollo at Delphi.60 The sacrifice at Aulis 396 BCedit Lysander and Agesilaus had intended the expedition to be a Panhellenic enterprise61 but Athens Corinth and especially Thebes refused to participate.6263 In Spring 396 Agesilaus came to Aulis in Boeotian territory to sacrifice on the place where Agamemnon had done so just before his departure to Troy at the head of the Greek army in the Iliad thus giving a grandiose aspect to the expedition. However he did not inform the Boeotians and brought his own seer to perform the sacrifice instead of the local one. Learning this the Boeotians prevented him from sacrificing and further humiliated him by casting away the victim they perhaps intended to provoke a confrontation as the relations between Sparta and Thebes had become execrable. Agesilaus then left to Asia but Thebes remained hateful to him for the rest of his life.64 Meeting between Spartan king Agesilaus left and Pharnabazus II right in 395 BC when Agesilaus agreed to remove himself from Hellespontine Phrygia. Campaign in Asia 396394 BCedit Once Agesilaus landed in Ephesus the Spartan main base he concluded a three months truce with Tissaphernes likely to settle the affairs among the Greek allies.65 He integrated some of the Greek mercenaries formerly hired by Cyrus the Younger the Ten Thousand in his army. They had returned from Persia under the leadership of Xenophon who also remained in Agesilaus staff.66 In Ephesus Agesilaus authority was nevertheless overshadowed by Lysander who was reacquainted with many of his supporters men he had placed in control of the Greek cities at the end of the Peloponnesian War. Angered by his local aura Agesilaus humiliated Lysander several times to force him to leave the army despite his former relationship and Lysanders role in his accession to the throne.6768 Plutarch adds that after Agesilaus emancipation from him Lysander returned to his undercover scheme to make the monarchy elective.69 After Lysanders departure Agesilaus raided Phrygia the satrapy of Pharnabazus until his advance guard was defeated not far from Daskyleion by the superior Persian cavalry.7071 He then wintered at Ephesus where he trained a cavalry force perhaps on the advice of Xenophon who had commanded the cavalry of the Ten Thousand.7273 In 395 the Spartan king managed to trick Tissaphernes into thinking that he would attack Caria in the south of Asia Minor forcing the satrap to hold a defence line on the Meander river. Instead Agesilaus moved north to the important city of Sardis. Tissaphernes hastened to meet the king there but his cavalry sent in advance was defeated by Agesilaus army.7475 After his victory at the Battle of Sardis Agesilaus became the first king to be given the command of both land and sea.76 He delegated the naval command to his brotherinlaw Peisander whom he appointed navarch despite his inexperience perhaps Agesilaus wanted to avoid the rise of a new Lysander who owed his prominence to his time as navarch. After his defeat Tissaphernes was executed and replaced as satrap by Tithraustes who gave Agesilaus 30 talents to move north to the satrapy of Pharnabazus Persian satraps were often bitter rivals.777879 Augesilaus Phrygian campaign of 394 was fruitless as he lacked the siege equipment required to take the fortresses of Leonton Kephalai Gordion and Miletou Teichos.80 Tens of thousands of Darics popularly called archers the main currency in Persia were used to bribe the Greek states to start a war against Sparta so that Agesilaus would have to be recalled from Asia.81 Xenophon tells that Agesilaus then wanted to campaign further east in Asia and sow discontent among the subjects of the Achaemenid empire or even to conquer Asia.80 Plutarch went further and wrote that Agesilaus had prepared an expedition to the heart of Persia up to her capital of Susa thus making him a forerunner of Alexander the Great. It is very unlikely that Agesilaus really had such a grand campaign in mind regardless he was soon forced to return to Europe in 3
94.8 2 Corinthian War 395387 BCedit Although Thebes and Corinth had been allies of Sparta throughout the Peloponnesian War they were dissatisfied by the settlement of the war in 404 with Sparta as leader of the Greek world. Spartas imperialist expansion in the Aegean greatly upset its former allies notably by establishing friendly regimes and garrisons in smaller cities.8384 Through large gifts Tithraustes also encouraged Spartas former allies to start a war in order to force the recall of Agesilaus from Asiaeven though the influence of Persian gold has been exaggerated.7685 The initiative came from Thebes which provoked a war between their ally Ozolian Locris and Phocis in order to bring Sparta to the latters defence.86 Lysander and the other king Pausanias entered Boeotia which enabled the Thebans to bring Athens in the war. Lysander then besieged Haliartus without waiting for Pausanias and was killed in a Boeotian counterattack. In Sparta Pausanias was condemned to death by Lysanders friends and went into exile.8788 After its success at Haliartus Thebes was able to build a coalition against Sparta with notably Argos and Corinth where a war council was established and securing the defection of most of the cities of northern and central Greece.8990 Unable to wage war on two fronts and with the loss of Lysander and Pausanias Sparta had no choice but to recall Agesilaus from Asia.91 The Asian Greeks fighting for him said they wanted to continue serving with him while Agesilaus promised he would return to Asia as soon as he could.92 Map of the situation in the Aegean in 394 BC with the long return of Agesilaus from Asia. Agesilaus returned to Greece by land crossing the Hellespont and from there along the coast of the Aegean Sea. In Thessaly he won a cavalry battle near Narthacium against the Pharsalians who had made an alliance with Thebes.939495 He then entered Boeotia by the Thermopylae where he received reinforcements from Sparta.96 Meanwhile Aristodamosthe regent of the young Agiad king Agesipoliswon a major victory at Nemea near Argos which was offset by the disaster of the Spartan navy at Knidos against the Persian fleet led by Konon an exiled Athenian general. Agesilaus lied to his men about the outcome of the battle of Knidos to avoid demoralising them as they were about to fight a large engagement against the combined armies of Thebes Athens Argos and Corinth. The following Battle of Coroneia was a classic clash between two lines of hoplites.97 The antiSpartan allies were rapidly defeated but the Thebans managed to retreat in good order despite Agesilaus activity on the front line which caused him several injuries. The next day the Thebans requested a truce to recover their dead therefore conceding defeat although they had not been bested on the battlefield.98 Agesilaus appears to have tried to win an honourable victory by risking his life and being merciful with some Thebans who had sought shelter in the nearby Temple of Athena Itonia.99 He then moved to Delphi where he offered one tenth of the booty he had amassed since his landing at Ephesos and returned to Sparta.98 No pitched battle took place in Greece in 393. Perhaps Agesilaus was still recovering from his wounds or he was deprived of command because of the opposition of Lysanders and Pausanias friends who were disappointed by his lack of decisive victory and his appointment of Peisander as navarch before the disaster of Knidos.100 The loss of the Spartan fleet besides allowed Konon to capture the island of Kythera in the south of the Peloponnese from where he could raid Spartan territory.101 In 392 Sparta sent Antalcidas to Asia in order to negotiate a general peace with Tiribazus the satrap of Lydia while Sparta would recognise Persias sovereignty over the Asian Greek cities. However the Greek allies also sent emissaries to Sardis to refuse Antalcidas plan and Artaxerxes likewise rejected it. A second peace conference in Sparta failed the following year because of Athens.102 A personal enemy of Antalcidas Agesilaus likely disapproved these talks which show that his influence at home had waned.103 Plutarch says that he befriended the young Agiad king Agesipolis possibly to prevent his opponents from coalescing behind him.104 By 391 Agesilaus had apparently recovered his influence as he was appointed at the head of the army while his halfbrother Teleutias became navarch.105 The target was Argos which had absorbed Corinth into a political union the previous year.101 In 390 BC he made several successful expeditions into Corinthian territory capturing Lechaeum and Peiraion. The loss however of a battalion mora destroyed by Iphicrates neutralised these successes and Agesilaus returned to Sparta. In 389 BC he conducted a campaign in Acarnania106 but two years later the Peace of Antalcidas warmly supported by Agesilaus put an end to the war maintaining Spartan hegemony over Greece and returning the Greek cities of Asia Minor to the Achaemenid Empire. In this interval Agesilaus declined command over Spartas aggression on Mantineia and justified Phoebidas seizure of the Theban Cadmea so long as the outcome provided glory to Sparta.10787 Declineedit Agesilaus expels the Illyrians from Epirus in 385 BC When war broke out afresh with Thebes Agesilaus twice invaded Boeotia in 378 and 377 BC although he spent the next five years largely out of action due to an unspecified but apparently grave illness. In the congress of 371 an altercation is recorded between him and the Theban general Epaminondas and due to his influence Thebes was peremptorily excluded from the peace and orders given for Agesilauss royal colleague Cleombrotus to march against Thebes in 371. Cleombrotus was defeated and killed at the Battle of Leuctra and the Spartan supremacy overthrown.108 In 370 Agesilaus was engaged in an embassy to Mantineia and reassured the Spartans with an invasion of Arcadia. He preserved an unwalled Sparta against the revolts and conspiracies of helots perioeci and even other Spartans and against external enemies with four different armies led by Epaminondas penetrating Laconia that same year. Asia Minor expedition 366 BCedit In 366 BC Sparta and Athens dissatisfied with the Persian kings support of Thebes following the embassy of Philiscus of Abydos decided to provide careful military support to the opponents of the Achaemenid king. Athens and Sparta provided support for the revolting satraps in the Revolt of the Satraps in particular Ariobarzanes Sparta sent a force to Ariobarzanes under an aging Agesilaus while Athens sent a force under Timotheus which was however diverted when it became obvious that Ariobarzanes had entered frontal conflict with the Achaemenid king.109110 An Athenian mercenary force under Chabrias was also sent to the Egyptian Pharaoh Tachos who was also fighting against the Achaemenid king.109111 According to Xenophon112 Agesilaus in order to gain money for prosecuting the war supported the satrap Ariobarzanes of Phrygia in his revolt against Artaxerxes II in 364 Revolt of the Satraps. Again in 362 Epaminondas almost succeeded in seizing the city of Sparta with a rapid and unexpected march. The Battle of Mantinea in which Agesilaus took no part was followed by a general peace Sparta however stood aloof hoping even yet to recover her supremacy. Expedition to Egyptedit Agesilas center with Athenian general Chabrias left in the service of Egyptian king Nectanebo I Egypt. Sometime after the Battle of Mantineia Agesilaus went to Egypt at the head of a mercenary force to aid the king Nectanebo I and his regent Teos against Persia. In the summer of 358 he transferred his services to Teoss cousin and rival Nectanebo II who in return for his help gave him a sum of over 200 talents. On his way home Agesilaus died in Cyrenaica around the age of 84 after a reign of some 41 years.iii His body was embalmed in wax and buried at Sparta.107 He was succeeded by his son Archidamus III. Legacyedit Agesilaus was of small stature and unimpressive appearance and was lame from birth. These facts were used as an argument against his succession an oracle having warned Sparta against a lame reign. Most ancient writers considered him a highly successful leader in guerrilla warfare alert and quick yet cautiousa man moreover whose personal bravery was rarely questioned in his own time. Of his courage temperance and hardiness many instances are cited and to these were added the less Spartan qualities of kindliness and tenderness as a father and a friend. As examples there was the story of his riding a stickhorse with his children and upon being discovered by a friend desiring that the friend not mention what he had seen until he was the father of children and because of the affection of his son Archidamus for Cleonymus he saved Sphodrias Cleonymus father from execution for his incursion into Piraeus and dishonourable retreat in 3
78.1 07 Modern writers tend to be slightly more critical of Agesilaus reputation and achievements reckoning him an excellent soldier but one who had a poor understanding of sea power and siegecraft.116 As a statesman he won himself both enthusiastic adherents and bitter enemies. Agesilaus was most successful in the opening and closing periods of his reign commencing but then surrendering a glorious career in Asia and in extreme age maintaining his prostrate country. Other writers acknowledge his extremely high popularity at home but suggest his occasionally rigid and arguably irrational political loyalties and convictions contributed greatly to Spartan decline notably his unremitting hatred of Thebes which led to Spartas humiliation at the Battle of Leuctra and thus the end of Spartan hegemony.116 Historian J. B. Bury remarks that there is something melancholy about his career born into a Sparta that was the unquestioned continental power of Hellas the Sparta which mourned him eighty four years later had suffered a series of military defeats which would have been unthinkable to his forebears had seen its population severely decline and had run so short of money that its soldiers were increasingly sent on campaigns fought more for money than for defense or glory.117 Plutarch also describes how often to remove the threat of instigators of internal dissension Agesilaus would send his enemies abroad with governorships where they often were corrupt and procured themselves enemies. Agesilaus would then protect them against these new enemies of theirs so as to make them his friends. As a result he no longer had to face internal opposition as his enemies had henceforth become allies. As for his personal life though he had two daughters Eupolia and Prolyta and a wife Cleora he nontheless had the habbit of forming homoosexual attachments for young men. Xenophons Agesilaus. Other historical accounts paint Agesilaus as a prototype for the ideal leader. His awareness thoughtfulness and wisdom were all traits to be emulated diplomatically while his bravery and shrewdness in battle epitomised the heroic Greek commander. These historians point towards the unstable oligarchies established by Lysander in the former Athenian Empire and the failures of Spartan leaders such as Pausanias and Kleombrotos for the eventual suppression of Spartan power. The ancient historian Xenophon was a huge admirer and served under Agesilaus during the campaigns into Asia Minor.87 Plutarch includes among Agesilaus 78 essays and speeches comprising the apophthegmata Agesilaus letter to the ephors on his recall We have reduced most of Asia driven back the barbarians made arms abundant in Ionia. But since you bid me according to the decree come home I shall follow my letter may perhaps be even before it. For my command is not mine but my countrys and her allies. And a commander then commands truly according to right when he sees his own commander in the laws and ephors or others holding office in the state. And when asked whether Agesilaus wanted a memorial erected in his honour If I have done any noble action that is a sufficient memorial if I have done nothing noble all the statues in the world will not preserve my memory.iv Agesilaus lived in the most frugal style alike at home and in the field and though his campaigns were undertaken largely to secure booty he was content to enrich the state and his friends and to return as poor as he had set forth.87118119120121 Notesedit  The article follows the majority view but mentions the dates favoured by the minority view.  The precise date of Agesilauss accession depends on the chronology of the Elean War and of his own date of death which are uncertain. Cartledge34 dates it to the late summer of 400 Hamilton35 to 398.  Cartledge 1987113 and Hamilton 1991114 disagreed on Agesilauss date of death with the former preferring the winter of 36059 and the latter that of 3598. One more recent study using Egyptian regnal dates concludes that Nectanebo II seized power in the summer of 358 BC and that Agesilaus died later that same year right after the campaigning and sailing season.115  In Greek                  Referencesedit  Shipley Commentary on Agesilaos p. 58 spells her Lampido.
