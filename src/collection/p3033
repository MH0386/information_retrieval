Severus died in 211 and although he intended for his sons to rule together they proved incapable of sharing power culminating with the murder of Geta in December of that year.

He was born on 7 March in either Rome12 or Mediolanum34 at a time when his father was only a provincial governor at the service of Emperor Commodus. In 198 Geta was raised to Caesar. Septimius Severus gave him the title of augustus in late 2
09.5  During the campaign against the Britons in the early 
3 rd century AD imperial propaganda promoted the image of a happy family that shared the responsibilities of rule. Getas brother Caracalla acted as Severus secondincommand and administrative and bureaucratic duties were Getas responsibility. In reality however the rivalry and antipathy between the brothers did not abate. With the death of Severus in 211 control of the empire passed to Geta and Caracalla jointly.6 Joint emperoredit When Septimius Severus died in Eboracum on 4 February 211 Caracalla and Geta were proclaimed joint emperors and returned to Rome. Their mother Julia Domna who had served as a crucial advisor and confidante to her husband was able to maintain her political influence over two coemperors. It is said that on the journey from Britain to Rome the two brothers kept well away from each other not once lodging in the same house or sharing a common meal.7 Geta Dying in his Mothers Arms JacquesAugustinCatherine Pajou 17661828 Staatsgalerie Stuttgart Their joint rule was a failure. The Imperial Palace was divided into two separate sections and neither allowed the servants of the other into his own. They only met in the presence of their mother and with a strong military guard being in constant fear of assassination.8 The current stability of their joint government was only through the mediation and leadership of their mother Julia Domna accompanied by other senior courtiers and generals in the military. The historian Herodian asserted that the brothers decided to split the empire in two halves but with the strong opposition of their mother the idea was rejected when by the end of 211 the situation had become unbearable.9 Caracalla tried unsuccessfully to murder Geta during the festival of Saturnalia 17 December. Finally the next week Caracalla had his mother arrange a peace meeting with his brother in his mothers apartments thus depriving Geta of his bodyguards and then had him murdered in her arms by centurions.101112 Deleted mention of Geta in an inscription after his damnatio memoriae Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Cagliari Caracalla ordered the damnatio memoriae which was thoroughly carried out as is clear from the archaeological record.1314 Reportedly Caracalla was thereafter tormented by guilt over his deed but sought to expiate it by adding to this crime the proscription of all his brothers former followers.15 Cassius Dio stated that around 20000 men and women were killed or proscribed on this charge during this time.16 Portraitedit Very few marble portraits attributable to Geta survive to date presumably due to the very thorough damnatio memoriae which resulted in the erasing of his images. However Roman coins with his image are plentiful and can reflect how his father Septimius Severus and mother Julia Domna and later Geta himself wanted him to be seen by the Roman people and especially the Roman military. Images of Geta and his older brother Caracalla cannot be well distinguished until the death of the father. Both sons were supposed to be presented as equally suitable heirs to the throne showing thus more depth to the dynasty. On his coins Caracalla who became Augustus in 198 was shown with a wreath of laurels while Geta remained bareheaded until he himself became Augustus in 2
09.1 7 Between 209 and their fathers death in February 211 both brothers were shown as equally mature young men with a short full beard ready to take over the empire. Between the death of Septimus Severus and the assassination of Geta Caracallas portraits did not change while Geta was depicted with a long beard with hanging hairs much like his father a strong indication of Getas efforts to be seen as the true successor of his father.17 The Severan Tondo panel painting depicts Septimius Severus and his family with an obliterated face assumed to be Geta.
