19 th Dynasty Akhenre Setepenre Siptah or Merneptah Siptah was the penultimate ruler of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt. His fathers identity is currently unknown. Both Seti II and Amenmesse have been suggested although the fact that Siptah later changed his royal name or nomen to Merneptah Siptah after his Year 2 suggests rather that his father was Merneptah. If correct this would make Siptah and Seti II halfbrothers since both of them were sons of Merneptah. He was not the crown prince but succeeded to the throne as a child after the death of Seti II. His accession date occurred on I Peret day 2 around the month of December.3 Originsedit See also Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt family tree Historically it was believed that Tiaa a wife of Seti II was the mother of Siptah.4 This view persisted until it was eventually realized that a relief in the Louvre Museum E 26901 pairs Siptahs name together with the name of his mother a certain Sutailya or Soteraya.5 Sutailya was a Canaanite rather than a native Egyptian name which means that she was almost certainly a kings concubine from Canaan.6 However DodsonHilton assert that this is not correct and that the lady was instead the mother of RamessesSiptah and a wife of Ramesses II.7 The identity of his father is currently unknown some Egyptologists speculate it may have been Amenmesse rather than Seti II since both Siptah and Amenmesse spent their youth in Chemmis8 and both are specifically excluded from Ramesses IIIs Medinet Habu procession of statues of ancestral kings unlike Merneptah or Seti. This suggests that Amenmesse and Siptah were interrelated in such a way that they were regarded as illegitimate rulers and that therefore they were probably father and son.9 However another interpretation here is that Siptah was regarded as illegitimate by the later 
20 th dynasty kings since Siptah required the assistance of Chancellor Bay to secure the kingship since he was just another minor son of Merneptah rather than a direct son of Seti II. A headless statue of Siptah now in Munich shows him seated on the lap of another Pharaoh presumably his father. The British Egyptologist Aidan Dodson states The only ruler of the period who could have promoted such destruction was Amenmesse and likewise he was the only king whose offspring would have required such explicit promotion. The demolition of this figure is likely to have closely followed the fall of Bay or the death of Siptah himself when any shortlived rehabilitation of Amenmesse would have ended.10 If Siptah was a son of Seti II it is unlikely that he would have been considered as an illegitimate king by later 
20 th Dynasty New Kingdom pharaohs. Due to his youth and perhaps his problematic parentage he was placed under the guidance of his stepmotherthe queen regent Twosret.11 Siptah ruled Egypt for almost six years as a young man. Siptah was only a child of ten or eleven years when he assumed power since a medical examination of his mummy reveals the king was about sixteen years old at death. He was tall at 
1.6  metres had curly reddish brown hair and likely had poliomyelitis with a deformed left foot.1213 Reignedit See also End of the 
19 th Dynasty A scarab with king Siptahs name Chancellor Bay publicly boasts that he was instrumental in installing Siptah on the throne in several inscriptions including an Aswan stela set up by Seti the Viceroy of Kush14 and at Gebel elSilsila.1516 A key graffito located at the entrance to the Speos of Horemheb at Gebel elSilsila depicts Bay standing in a pose of adoration directly behind Siptah who is making an offering to Amun a following inscription in the graffito reads the spirit of the Great Superintendent of the Seal of the entire land who established the King Siptah in the place of his father beloved of his lord Bay.17 Bay however later fell out of favor at court presumably for overreaching himself and last appears in public in a dated Year 4 inscription from Siptahs reign. He was executed in the fifth year of Siptahs reign on orders of the king himself. News of his execution was passed to the Workmen of Deir elMedina in Ostraca IFAO 1254. This ostraca was translated and published in 2000 by Pierre Grandet in a French Egyptological journal.18 Gae Callender notes that the reason for the kings message to the workmen was to notify them to cease all work on decorating Bays tomb since Bay had now been deemed a traitor to the state.19 Foundation sandstone block showing 2 cartouches of king Siptah Saptah MerenptahSiptah. 
19 th Dynasty. From the mortuary temple of MerenptahSiptah at Thebes Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology London Siptah himself is last attested sometime in his 
6 th regnal Year on a graffito located at the South Temple of Buhen.20 He likely died in the middle of II Akhetperhaps around II Akhet 12 of his 
6 th Year. This assumes a traditional 
70 day mummification period if Siptah was buried on IV Akhet 22. Evidence for his burial on the latter date is recorded in ostracon O. Cairo CG 257
92.2 1 This ostraca from Deir elMedina mentions that the Vizier Hori visited the workmen of Deir elMedina first on II Akhet 24 and second on IV Akhet 
19.2 2 The final line on the ostracon reads as IV Akhet 22 Burial took place.23 Since this event can only refer to a kings burial the question here is the identity of this king. Hori was appointed vizier around Regnal Year 6 II Shemu 6 and I Peret X of Seti IIs reign and held this office through the reigns of Siptah Twosret and Setnakht and into that of Ramesses III.24 The ostracon could not refer to Setnakhts death because this king died on I Shemu 25 since his son Ramesses III succeeded him the next day. Twosret was ousted from power by Setnakht therefore the burial does not refer to her either. Seti II must have died in late IV Akhet or early I Peretafter the 
70 day mummification periodsince a graffito located above KV14 Twosrets tomb records his burial on III Peret 
11.2 5 Therefore the IV Akhet 22 burial date likely records the burial of Siptah himself. Siptahs death would have occurred sometime around II Akhet 12. Siptah himself would have ruled Egypt for approximately 5 years and 10 months since his predecessor Seti II died around the end of IV Akhet and the beginning of I Peret even if he did not legally assume the throne until the start of II Akhet with the aid of the powerful court official Bay. After his death Twosret simply assumed his Regnal Years and ruled Egypt as a queen for a year or two at the most. Siptah was buried in the Valley of the Kings in tomb KV4726 but his mummy was not found there. In 1898 it was discovered along with 18 others in a mummy cache within the KV35 tomb of Amenhotep II. The study of his tomb shows that it was conceived and planned in the same style as those of Twosret and Bay clearly part of the same architectural design. In April 2021 his mummy was moved from the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs Golden Parade.27 See alsoedit Wikimedia Commons has media related to Siptah.
