He reigned as the first Roman emperor from 27 BC until his death in AD 14.a The reign of Augustus initiated an imperial cult as well as an era of imperial peace the Pax Romana or Pax Augusta in which the Roman world was largely free of armed conflict aside from expansionary wars and the Year of the Four Emperors which occurred after Augustus reign. The Principate system of government was established during his reign and lasted until the Crisis of the Third Century. Octavian was born into an equestrian branch of the plebeian gens Octavia. His maternal greatuncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC and Octavian was named in Caesars will as his adopted son and heir as a result he inherited Caesars name estate and the loyalty of his legions. He Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at the Battle of Philippi 42 BC the Triumvirate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as de facto dictators. The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members Lepidus was exiled in 36 BC and Antony was defeated by Octavian at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. Antony and his wife Cleopatra the Ptolemaic queen of Egypt killed themselves during Octavians invasion of Egypt which then became a Roman province. After the demise of the Second Triumvirate Augustus restored the outward facade of the free republic with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate the executive magistrates and the legislative assemblies yet he maintained autocratic authority by having the Senate grant him lifetime tenure as commanderinchief tribune and censor. A similar ambiguity is seen in his chosen names the implied rejection of monarchical titles whereby he called himself Princeps Civitatis First Citizen juxtaposed with his adoption of the title Augustus. Augustus dramatically enlarged the empire annexing Egypt Dalmatia Pannonia Noricum and Raetia expanding possessions in Africa and completing the conquest of Hispania but he suffered a major setback in Germania. Beyond the frontiers he secured the empire with a buffer region of client states and made peace with the Parthian Empire through diplomacy. He reformed the Roman system of taxation developed networks of roads with an official courier system established a standing army established the Praetorian Guard as well as official police and firefighting services for Rome and rebuilt much of the city during his reign. Augustus died in AD 14 at age 75 probably from natural causes. Persistent rumors substantiated somewhat by deaths in the imperial family have claimed his wife Livia poisoned him. He was succeeded as emperor by his adopted son Tiberius Livias son and former husband of Augustus only biological child Julia. Name As a consequence of Roman customs society and personal preference Augustus sts awGUSTs was known by many names throughout his life Gaius Octavius ktevis okTAYvees Latin ais ktawis. According to Suetonius the cognomen Thurinus  Latin turins of Thurii was added to his birth name as a toddler in 60 BC.
2 b Later after he had taken the name of Caesar his rival Mark Antony referred to him as Thurinus in order to belittle him. In response he merely said he was surprised that using his old name was thought to be an insult.45 Gaius Julius Caesar. After his adoption by Julius Caesar on the latters death in 44 BC he took from Caesars name6 but was often distinguished by historians from his adoptive father by the addition Octavianus  Latin ktawians after the name denoting that he was a former member of the gens Octavia. In English he is mainly known by the anglicization Octavian ktevin okTAYveen for the period between 44 and 27 BC.7 Imperator Caesar. Octavians early coins and inscriptions all refer to him simply as Gaius Caesar but by 38 BC he had replaced Gaius with the victory title imperator commander.89 Occasionally the epithet divi filius or divi Iulii filius son of the divine Julius was included alluding to Julius Caesars deification in 42 BC.10 Imperator Caesar Augustus. On 16 January 27 BC partly on his own insistence the Roman Senate granted him the honorific Augustus  Latin austs. Historians use this name to refer to him from 27 BC until his death in AD 
14.1 1 The name is sometimes given as Augustus Caesar.1213 Early life Main article Early life of Augustus He was born in Rome on 23 September 63 BC. His paternal family was from the Volscian town of Velletri approximately 40 kilometres 25 mi southeast of the city.1415 He was born at Ox Head a small property on the Palatine Hill very close to the Roman Forum. In his childhood he received the cognomen Thurinus possibly commemorating his fathers victory at Thurii over a rebellious band of slaves which occurred a few years after his birth.4 Suetonius wrote There are many indications that the Octavian family was in days of old a distinguished one at Velitrae for not only was a street in the most frequented part of town long ago called Octavius but an altar was shown there besides consecrated by an Octavius. This man was leader in a war with a neighbouring town ...16 Due to the crowded nature of Rome at the time Octavian was taken to his fathers home village at Velletri to be raised. Octavian mentions his fathers equestrian family only briefly in his memoirs. His paternal greatgrandfather Octavius was a military tribune in Sicily during the Second Punic War. His grandfather had served in several local political offices. His father also named Octavius had been governor of Macedonia. His mother Atia was the niece of Julius Caesar.1718 A denarius from 44 BC showing Julius Caesar on the obverse and the goddess Venus on the reverse of the coin. Caption CAESAR IMP. M.  L. AEMILIVS BVCA His father died in 59 BC when Octavian was four years old.19 His mother married a former governor of Syria Lucius Marcius Philippus.2021 Philippus claimed descent from Alexander the Great and was elected consul in 56 BC. Philippus never had much of an interest in young Octavian. Because of this Octavian was raised by his grandmother Julia the sister of Julius Caesar. Julia died in 52 or 51 BC and Octavian delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother.222324 From this point his mother and stepfather took a more active role in raising him. He donned the toga virilis toga of manhood four years later25 and was elected to the College of Pontiffs in 47 BC.2627 The following year he was put in charge of the Greek games that were staged in honor of the Temple of Venus Genetrix built by Julius Caesar.27 According to Nicolaus of Damascus Octavian wished to join Caesars staff for his campaign in Africa but gave way when his mother protested.28 In 46 BC she consented for him to join Caesar in Hispania where he planned to fight the forces of Pompey Caesars late enemy but Octavian fell ill and was unable to travel. When he had recovered he sailed to the front but was shipwrecked. After coming ashore with a handful of companions he crossed hostile territory to Caesars camp which impressed Caesar considerably.25 Velleius Paterculus reports that after that time Caesar allowed the young man to share his carriage.29 When back in Rome Caesar deposited a new will with the Vestal Virgins naming Octavian as the prime beneficiary.30 Rise to power Heir to Caesar The Death of Caesar by Vincenzo Camuccini. On 15 March 44 BC Octavians adoptive father Julius Caesar was assassinated by a conspiracy led by Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus. Galleria Nazionale dArte Moderna Rome. Octavian was studying and undergoing military training in Apollonia Illyria when Julius Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March 15 March 44 BC. He rejected the advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in Macedonia and sailed to Italy to ascertain whether he had any potential political fortunes or security.31 Caesar had no living legitimate children under Roman lawc and so had adopted Octavian his grandnephew in his will making him his primary heir.32 Mark Antony later charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favours though Suetonius describes Antonys accusation as political slander.33 This form of slander was popular during this time in the Roman Republic to demean and discredit political opponents by accusing them of having an inappropriate sexual affair.3435 After landing at Lupiae near Brundisium Octavian learned the contents of Caesars will and only then did he decide to become Caesars political heir as well as heir to twothirds of his estate.183136 Upon his adoption Octavian assumed his greatuncles name Gaius Julius Caesar.6 Roman citizens adopted into a new family usually retained their old nomen in cognomen form e.g. Octavianus for one who had been an Octavius Aemilianus for one who had been an Aemilius etc.. However though some of his contemporaries did37 there is no evidence that Octavian officially used the name Octavianus as it would have made his modest origins too obvious.383940 Historians usually refer to the new Caesar as Octavian during the time between his adoption and his assumption of the name Augustus in 27 BC in order to avoid confusing the dead dictator with his heir.41 Octavian could not rely on his limited funds to make a successful entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy.42 After a warm welcome by Caesars soldiers at Brundisium43 Octavian demanded a portion of the funds that were allotted by Caesar for the intended war against the Parthian Empire in the Middle East.42 This amounted to 700 million sesterces stored at Brundisium the staging ground in Italy for military operations in the east.44 A later senatorial investigation into the disappearance of the public funds took no action against Octavian since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the Senates arch enemy Mark Antony.43 Octavian made another bold move in 44 BC when without official permission he appropriated the annual tribute that had been sent from Romes Near Eastern province to Italy.3945 Octavian began to bolster his personal forces with Caesars veteran legionaries and with troops designated for the Parthian war gathering support by emphasizing his status as heir to Caesar.3146 On his march to Rome through Italy Octavians presence and newly acquired funds attracted many winning over Caesars former veterans stationed in Campania.39 By June he had gathered an army of 3000 loyal veterans paying each a bonus of 500 denarii.4748 Growing tensions A bust of Augustus as a younger Octavian dated c.30 BC. Capitoline Museums Rome Arriving in Rome on 6 May 44 BC Octavian found consul Mark Antony Caesars former colleague in an uneasy truce with the dictators assassins. They had been granted a general amnesty on 17 March yet Antony had succeeded in driving most of them out of Rome with an inflammatory eulogy at Caesars funeral mounting public opinion against the assassins.39 Mark Antony was amassing political support but Octavian still had the opportunity to rival him as the leading member of the faction supporting Caesar. Antony had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he initially opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status.49 It is alleged that Antony refused to hand over the money due Octavian as Caesars adopted heir possibly on grounds that it would take time to disentangle it from state funds.50 During the summer Octavian won the support of Caesarian veterans and also made common cause with those senators  many of whom were themselves former Caesarians  who perceived Antony as a threat to the state. After an abortive attempt by the veterans to reconcile Octavian and Antony Antonys bellicose edicts against Brutus and Cassius alienated him from the moderate Caesarians in the senate who feared a renewed civil war.51 In September Marcus Tullius Cicero began to attack Antony in a series of speeches portraying him as a threat to the republican order.5253 First conflict with Antony With opinion in Rome turning against him and his year of consular power nearing its end Antony attempted to pass laws that would assign him the province of Cisalpine Gaul.5455 Octavian meanwhile built up a private army in Italy by recruiting Caesarian veterans and on 28 November he won over two of Antonys legions with the enticing offer of monetary gain.565758 In the face of Octavians large and capable force Antony saw the danger of staying in Rome and to the relief of the Senate he left Rome for Cisalpine Gaul which was to be handed to him on 1 January.58 However the province had earlier been assigned to Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus one of Caesars assassins who now refused to yield to Antony. Antony besieged him at Mutina59 and rejected the resolutions passed by the Senate to stop the fighting. The Senate had no army to enforce their resolutions. This provided an opportunity for Octavian who already was known to have armed forces.57 Cicero also defended Octavian against Antonys taunts about Octavians lack of noble lineage and aping of Julius Caesars name stating we have no more brilliant example of traditional piety among our youth.60 At the urging of Cicero the Senate inducted Octavian as senator on 1 January 43 BC yet he also was given the power to vote alongside the former consuls.6158 In addition Octavian was granted imperium pro praetore commanding power which legalized his command of troops sending him to relieve the siege along with Hirtius and Pansa the consuls for 43 BC. 6162 He assumed the fasces on 7 January63 a date that he would later commemorate as the beginning of his public career.596164 Antonys forces were defeated at the battles of Forum Gallorum 14 April and Mutina 21 April forcing Antony to retreat to Transalpine Gaul. Both consuls were killed however leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies.6566 These victories earned him his first acclamation as imperator a title reserved for victorious commanders.63 The Senate heaped many more rewards on Decimus Brutus than on Octavian for defeating Antony then attempted to give command of the consular legions to Decimus Brutus.67 In response Octavian stayed in the Po Valley and refused to aid any further offensive against Antony.68 In July an embassy of centurions sent by Octavian entered Rome and demanded the consulship left vacant by Hirtius and Pansa69 and also that the decree should be rescinded which declared Antony a public enemy.68 When this was refused he marched on the city with eight legions.68 He encountered no military opposition in Rome and on 19 August 43 BC was elected consul with his relative Quintus Pedius as coconsul.7071 Meanwhile Antony formed an alliance with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus another leading Caesarian.72 Second Triumvirate Proscriptions Aureus bearing the portraits of Mark Antony left and Octavian right issued in 41 BC to celebrate the establishment of the Second Triumvirate.

In a meeting near Bononia in October 43 BC Octavian Antony and Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate. Their powers were made official by the Senate on 27 November.74 This explicit arrogation of special powers lasting five years was then legalised by law passed by the plebs unlike the unofficial First Triumvirate formed by Pompey Julius Caesar and Marcus Licinius Crassus.7075 The triumvirs then set in motion proscriptions in which between 130 and 300 senatorsf and 2000 equites were branded as outlaws and deprived of their property and for those who failed to escape their lives.74 This decree issued by the triumvirate was motivated in part by a need to raise money to pay the salaries of their troops for the upcoming conflict against Caesars assassins Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus.77 Rewards for their arrest gave incentive for Romans to capture those proscribed while the assets and properties of those arrested were seized by the triumvirs.74 Contemporary Roman historians provide conflicting reports as to which triumvir was most responsible for the proscriptions and killing. However the sources agree that enacting the proscriptions was a means by all three factions to eliminate political enemies.78 Marcus Velleius Paterculus asserted that Octavian tried to avoid proscribing officials whereas Lepidus and Antony were to blame for initiating them. Cassius Dio defended Octavian as trying to spare as many as possible whereas Antony and Lepidus being older and involved in politics longer had many more enemies to deal with.79 This claim was rejected by Appian who maintained that Octavian shared an equal interest with Lepidus and Antony in eradicating his enemies.80 Suetonius said that Octavian was reluctant to proscribe officials but did pursue his enemies with more vigor than the other triumvirs.78 Plutarch described the proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat swapping of friends and family among Antony Lepidus and Octavian. For example Octavian allowed the proscription of his ally Cicero Antony the proscription of his maternal uncle Lucius Julius Caesar the consul of 64 BC and Lepidus his brother Paullus.79 Battle of Philippi and division of territory Further information Liberators civil war A denarius minted c. 18 BC. Obverse CAESAR AVGVSTVS reverse comet of eight rays with tail upward DIVVS IVLIVS DIVINE JULIUS. On 1 January 42 BC the Senate posthumously recognized Julius Caesar as a divinity of the Roman state divus Iulius. Octavian was able to further his cause by emphasizing the fact that he was divi filius Son of the Divine.81 Antony and Octavian then sent twentyeight legions by sea to face the armies of Brutus and Cassius who had built their base of power in Greece.82 After two battles at Philippi in Macedonia in October 42 the Caesarian army was victorious and Brutus and Cassius committed suicide. Mark Antony later used the examples of these battles as a means to belittle Octavian as both battles were decisively won with the use of Antonys forces. In addition to claiming responsibility for both victories Antony branded Octavian as a coward for handing over his direct military control to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa instead.83 After Philippi a new territorial arrangement was made among the members of the Second Triumvirate. Gaul and the province of Hispania were placed in the hands of Octavian. Antony traveled east to Egypt where he allied himself with Queen Cleopatra the former lover of Julius Caesar and mother of Caesars son Caesarion. Lepidus was left with the province of Africa stymied by Antony who conceded Hispania to Octavian instead.84 Octavian was left to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of thousands of veterans of the Macedonian campaign whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased and they also required land.84 There was no more governmentcontrolled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers so Octavian had to choose one of two options alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former.85 There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.86 Rebellion and marriage alliances There was widespread dissatisfaction with Octavian over these settlements of his soldiers and this encouraged many to rally at the side of Lucius Antonius who was brother of Mark Antony and supported by a majority in the Senate. Meanwhile Octavian asked for a divorce from Claudia the daughter of Fulvia Antonys wife and her first husband Publius Clodius Pulcher. He returned Claudia to her mother claiming that their marriage had never been consummated. Fulvia decided to take action. Together with Lucius Antonius she raised an army in Italy to fight for Antonys rights against Octavian. Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian however since the Roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries. Lucius and his allies ended up in a defensive siege at Perusia where Octavian forced them into surrender in early 40 BC.86 Fresco paintings inside the House of Augustus his residence during his reign as emperor Lucius and his army were spared because of his kinship with Antony the strongman of the East while Fulvia was exiled to Sicyon.87 Octavian showed no mercy however for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius. On 15 March the anniversary of Julius Caesars assassination he had 300 Roman senators and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius.88 Perusia also was pillaged and burned as a warning for others.87 This bloody event sullied Octavians reputation and was criticized by many such as Augustan poet Sextus Propertius.88 Sextus Pompeius the son of Pompey and still a renegade general following Julius Caesars victory over his father had established himself in Sicily and Sardinia as part of an agreement reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39 BC.89 Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius. Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance in 40 BC when he married Scribonia a sister or daughter of Pompeiuss fatherinlaw Lucius Scribonius Libo. Scribonia gave birth to Octavians only natural child Julia the same day that he divorced her to marry Livia Drusilla little more than a year after their marriage.88 While in Egypt Antony had been engaged in an affair with Cleopatra and had fathered three children with her.g Aware of his deteriorating relationship with Octavian Antony left Cleopatra he sailed to Italy in 40 BC with a large force to oppose Octavian laying siege to Brundisium. This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony however. Their centurions who had become important figures politically refused to fight because of their Caesarian cause while the legions under their command followed suit. Meanwhile in Sicyon Antonys wife Fulvia died of a sudden illness while Antony was en route to meet her. Fulvias death and the mutiny of their centurions allowed the two remaining triumvirs to effect a reconciliation.9091 In the autumn of 40 Octavian and Antony approved the Treaty of Brundisium by which Lepidus would remain in Africa Antony in the East Octavian in the West. The Italian Peninsula was left open to all for the recruitment of soldiers but in reality this provision was useless for Antony in the East. To further cement relations of alliance with Antony Octavian gave his sister Octavia Minor in marriage to Antony in late 40 BC.90 War with Sextus Pompeius Further information Bellum Siculum Sextus Pompeius threatened Octavian in Italy by denying shipments of grain through the Mediterranean Sea to the peninsula. Pompeiuss own son was put in charge as naval commander in the effort to cause widespread famine in Italy.91 Pompeiuss control over the sea prompted him to take on the name Neptuni filius son of Neptune.92 A temporary peace agreement was reached in 39 BC with the Pact of Misenum the blockade on Italy was lifted once Octavian granted Pompeius Sardinia Corsica Sicily and the Peloponnese and ensured him a future position as consul for 35 BC.9192 The territorial agreement between the triumvirate and Sextus Pompeius began to crumble once Octavian divorced Scribonia and married Livia on 17 January 38 BC.93 One of Pompeiuss naval commanders betrayed him and handed over Corsica and Sardinia to Octavian. Octavian lacked the resources to confront Pompeius alone so an agreement was reached with the Second Triumvirates extension for another fiveyear period beginning in 37 BC.7594 A denarius of Sextus Pompeius minted for his victory over Octavians fleet.

In supporting Octavian Antony expected to gain support for his own campaign against the Parthian Empire desiring to avenge Romes defeat at Carrhae in 53 BC.94 In an agreement reached at Tarentum Antony provided 120 ships for Octavian to use against Pompeius while Octavian was to send 20000 legionaries to Antony for use against Parthia. Octavian sent only a tenth of those promised which Antony viewed as an intentional provocation.95 Octavian and Lepidus launched a joint operation against Sextus in Sicily in 36 BC.96 Despite setbacks for Octavian the naval fleet of Sextus Pompeius was almost entirely destroyed on 3 September by General Agrippa at the naval battle of Naulochus. Sextus fled to the east with his remaining forces where he was captured and executed in Miletus by one of Antonys generals the following year. As Lepidus and Octavian accepted the surrender of Pompeiuss troops Lepidus attempted to claim Sicily for himself ordering Octavian to leave. Lepiduss troops deserted him however and defected to Octavian since they were weary of fighting and were enticed by Octavians promises of money.97 Lepidus surrendered to Octavian and was permitted to retain the office of pontifex maximus head of the college of priests but was ejected from the Triumvirate. His public career at an end he effectively was exiled to a villa at Cape Circei in Italy.7797 The Roman dominions were divided between Octavian in the West and Antony in the East. Octavian ensured Romes citizens of their rights to property in order to maintain peace and stability in his portion of the empire. This time he settled his discharged soldiers outside of Italy while also returning 30000 slaves to their former Roman ownersslaves who had fled to join Pompeiuss army and navy.98 Octavian had the Senate grant him his wife and his sister tribunal immunity or sacrosanctitas in order to ensure his own safety and that of Livia and Octavia once he returned to Rome.99 War with Antony and Cleopatra Main article War of Actium Anthony and Cleopatra by Lawrence AlmaTadema The Battle of Actium by Laureys a Castro painted 1672 National Maritime Museum London Meanwhile Antonys campaign turned disastrous against Parthia tarnishing his image as a leader and the mere 2000 legionaries sent by Octavian to Antony were hardly enough to replenish his forces.100 On the other hand Cleopatra could restore his army to full strength he already was engaged in a romantic affair with her so he decided to send Octavia back to Rome.101 Octavian used this to spread propaganda implying that Antony was becoming less than Roman because he rejected a legitimate Roman spouse for an Oriental paramour.102 In 36 BC Octavian used a political ploy to make himself look less autocratic and Antony more the villain by proclaiming that the civil wars were coming to an end and that he would step down as triumvirif only Antony would do the same. Antony refused.103 Roman troops captured the Kingdom of Armenia in 34 BC and Antony made his son Alexander Helios the ruler of Armenia. He also awarded the title Queen of Kings to Cleopatra acts that Octavian used to convince the Roman Senate that Antony had ambitions to diminish the preeminence of Rome.102 Octavian became consul once again on 1 January 33 BC and he opened the following session in the Senate with a vehement attack on Antonys grants of titles and territories to his relatives and to his queen.104 The breach between Antony and Octavian prompted a large portion of the senators as well as both of that years consuls to leave Rome and defect to Antony. However Octavian received two key deserters from Antony in the autumn of 32 BC Munatius Plancus and Marcus Titius.105 These defectors gave Octavian the information that he needed to confirm with the Senate all the accusations that he made against Antony.106 Octavian forcibly entered the temple of the Vestal Virgins and seized Antonys secret will which he promptly publicized. The will would have given away Romanconquered territories as kingdoms for his sons to rule and designated Alexandria as the site for a tomb for him and his queen.107108 In late 32 BC the Senate officially revoked Antonys powers as consul and declared war on Cleopatras regime in Egypt.109110 This mid
1 stcenturyBC Roman wall painting in the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus Pompeii is most likely a depiction of Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt as Venus Genetrix with her son Caesarion as cupid similar in appearance to the nowlost statue of Cleopatra erected by Julius Caesar in the Temple of Venus Genetrix within the Forum of Caesar. Its owner walled off the room with this painting most likely in immediate reaction to the execution of Caesarion on orders of Augustus in 30 BC when artistic depictions of Caesarion would have been considered a sensitive issue for the ruling regime.111112 In early 31 BC Antony and Cleopatra were temporarily stationed in Greece when Octavian gained a preliminary victory the navy successfully ferried troops across the Adriatic Sea under the command of Agrippa. Agrippa cut off Antony and Cleopatras main force from their supply routes at sea while Octavian landed on the mainland opposite the island of Corcyra modern Corfu and marched south. Trapped on land and sea deserters of Antonys army fled to Octavians side daily while Octavians forces were comfortable enough to make preparations.113 Antonys fleet sailed through the bay of Actium on the western coast of Greece in a desperate attempt to break free of the naval blockade. It was there that Antonys fleet faced the much larger fleet of smaller more maneuverable ships under commanders Agrippa and Gaius Sosius in the Battle of Actium on 2 September 31 BC.114 Antony and his remaining forces were spared by a lastditch effort from Cleopatras fleet that had been waiting nearby.115 Aureus of Octavian c. 30 BC British Museum A year later Octavian defeated their forces in Alexandria on 1 August 30 BCafter which Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide. Antony fell on his own sword and was taken by his soldiers back to Alexandria where he died in Cleopatras arms. Cleopatra died soon after by poisoning contrary to the popular belief that she was bitten by an asp.116 Octavian had exploited his position as Caesars heir to further his own political career and he was well aware of the dangers in allowing another person to do the same. He therefore followed the advice of the Greek philosopher Arius Didymus that two Caesars are one too many ordering Caesarion killed while sparing Cleopatras children by Antony with the exception of Antonys older son.117118 Octavian had previously shown little mercy to surrendered enemies and acted in ways that had proven unpopular with the Roman people yet he was given credit for pardoning many of his opponents after the Battle of Actium.119 Sole ruler of Rome See also Constitutional Reforms of Augustus and Propaganda in Augustan Rome Further information Coinage reform of Augustus After Actium and the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra Octavian was in a position to rule the entire republic under an unofficial principate1
20 but he had to achieve this through incremental power gains. He did so by courting the Senate and the people while upholding the republican traditions of Rome appearing that he was not aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy.121122 Marching into Rome Octavian and Agrippa were elected as consuls by the Senate.123 Years of civil war had left Rome in a state of near lawlessness but the republic was not prepared to accept the control of Octavian as a despot. At the same time Octavian could not give up his authority without risking further civil wars among the Roman generals and even if he desired no position of authority his position demanded that he look to the wellbeing of the city of Rome and the Roman provinces. Octavians aims from this point forward were to return Rome to a state of stability traditional legality and civility by lifting the overt political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free electionsin name at least.124 First settlement Main articles Constitution of the Roman Empire and History of the Constitution of the Roman Empire On 13 January 27 BC Octavian made a show of returning full power to the Roman Senate and relinquishing his control of the Roman provinces and their armies. Under his consulship however the Senate had little power in initiating legislation by introducing bills for senatorial debate. Octavian was no longer in direct control of the provinces and their armies but he retained the loyalty of active duty soldiers and veterans alike. The careers of many clients and adherents depended on his patronage as his financial power was unrivaled in the Roman Republic.125 Historian Werner Eck states The sum of his power derived first of all from various powers of office delegated to him by the Senate and people secondly from his immense private fortune and thirdly from numerous patronclient relationships he established with individuals and groups throughout the Empire. All of them taken together formed the basis of his auctoritas which he himself emphasized as the foundation of his political actions.126 To a large extent the public was aware of the vast financial resources that Octavian commanded. He failed to encourage enough senators to finance the building and maintenance of networks of roads in Italy in 20 BC but he undertook direct responsibility for them. This was publicized on the Roman currency issued in 16 BC after he donated vast amounts of money to the aerarium Saturni the public treasury.127 Octavian as a magistrate. The statues marble head was made c. 3020 BC the body sculpted in the 
2 nd century AD Louvre Paris. According to historian H. H. Scullard however Octavians power was based on the exercise of a predominant military power and ... the ultimate sanction of his authority was force however much the fact was disguised.128 The Senate proposed to Octavian the victor of Romes civil wars that he once again assume command of the provinces. The Senates proposal was a ratification of Octavians extraconstitutional power. Through the Senate Octavian was able to continue the appearance of a stillfunctional constitution. Feigning reluctance he accepted a tenyear responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered chaotic.129130 The provinces ceded to Augustus for that tenyear period comprised much of the conquered Roman world including all of Hispania and Gaul Syria Cilicia Cyprus and Egypt.129131 Moreover command of these provinces provided Octavian with control over the majority of Romes legions.131132 While Octavian acted as consul in Rome he dispatched senators to the provinces under his command as his representatives to manage provincial affairs and ensure that his orders were carried out. The provinces not under Octavians control were overseen by governors chosen by the Roman Senate.132 Octavian became the most powerful political figure in the city of Rome and in most of its provinces but he did not have a monopoly on political and martial power.133 The Senate still controlled North Africa an important regional producer of grain as well as Illyria and Macedonia two strategic regions with several legions.133 However the Senate had control of only five or six legions distributed among three senatorial proconsuls compared to the twenty legions under the control of Octavian and their control of these regions did not amount to any political or military challenge to Octavian.121128 The Senates control over some of the Roman provinces helped maintain a republican facade for the autocratic principate. Also Octavians control of entire provinces followed republicanera precedents for the objective of securing peace and creating stability in which such prominent Romans as Pompey had been granted similar military powers in times of crisis and instability.121 Change to Augustus Aureus minted c. AD 13 marked Caesar Augustus Divi F Pater Patriae On 16 January 27 BC138 the Senate gave Octavian the new title of augustus.139 Augustus is from the Latin word augere meaning to increase and can be translated as illustrious one or sublime.140139 It was a title of religious authority rather than political one and it indicated that Octavian now approached divinity.133 His name of Augustus was also more favorable than Romulus the previous one which he styled for himself in reference to the story of the legendary founder of Rome which symbolized a second founding of Rome.119 The title of Romulus was associated too strongly with notions of monarchy and kingship an image that Octavian tried to avoid.141 The Senate also confirmed his position as princeps senatus which originally meant the member of the Senate with the highest precedence142 but in this case it became an almost regnal title for a leader who was first in charge.143 The honorific augustus was inherited by all future emperors and became the de facto main title of the emperor.140144 As a result modern historians usually regard this event as the beginning of his reign as emperor.h Augustus himself appears to have reckoned his reign from 27 BC.1
50 i Augustus styled himself as Imperator Caesar divi filius Commander Caesar son of the deified one. With this title he boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar and the use of imperator signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory.j He transformed Caesar a cognomen for one branch of the Julian family into a new family line that began with him.139 The Arch of Augustus in Rimini Ariminum dedicated to Augustus by the Roman Senate in 27 BC is one of the oldest preserved arches in Italy.151 Augustus was granted the right to hang the corona civica civic crown above his door and to have laurels drape his doorposts.133 However he renounced flaunting insignia of power such as holding a scepter wearing a diadem or wearing the golden crown and purple toga of his predecessor Julius Caesar.152 If he refused to symbolize his power by donning and bearing these items on his person the Senate nonetheless awarded him with a golden shield displayed in the meeting hall of the Curia bearing the inscription virtus pietas clementia iustitiavalor piety clemency and justice.133153 Second settlement Portraits of Augustus show the emperor with idealized features. By 23 BC some of the unrepublican implications were becoming apparent concerning the settlement of 27 BC. Augustuss retention of an annual consulate drew attention to his de facto dominance over the Roman political system and cut in half the opportunities for others to achieve what was still nominally the preeminent position in the Roman state.154 Further he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus follow in his footsteps and eventually assume the principate in his turnk alienating his three greatest supporters Agrippa Maecenas and Livia.157 He appointed noted republican Calpurnius Piso who had fought against Julius Caesar and supported Cassius and Brutus158 as coconsul in 23 BC after his choice Aulus Terentius Varro Murena died unexpectedly.159160161 In the late spring Augustus had a severe illness and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure the continuation of the principate in some form155162 while allaying senators suspicions of his antirepublicanism. Augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa. However Augustus handed over to his coconsul Piso all of his official documents an account of public finances and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustuss supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away emptyhanded.163164 This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.165 Augustus bestowed only properties and possessions to his designated heirs as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republicanminded Romans fearful of monarchy.122 With regards to the principate it was obvious to Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position166 nonetheless by giving his signet ring to Agrippa Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor and that they should continue to obey Agrippa constitutional procedure notwithstanding.167155 The Blacas Cameo showing Augustus wearing a gorgoneion on a three layered sardonyx cameo AD 2050 Soon after his bout of illness subsided Augustus gave up his consulship. The only other times Augustus would serve as consul would be in the years 5 and 2 BC164168 both times to introduce his grandsons into public life.158 This was a clever ploy by Augustus ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain the consular position while allowing Augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class.169 Although Augustus had resigned as consul he desired to retain his consular imperium not just in his provinces but throughout the empire. This desire as well as the Marcus Primus affair led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the second settlement.170 The primary reasons for the second settlement were as follows. First after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship he was no longer in an official position to rule the state yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman imperial provinces where he was still a proconsul.164171 When he annually held the office of consul he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire when he deemed necessary.172 A second problem later arose showing the need for the second settlement in what became known as the Marcus Primus affair.173174 In late 24 or early 23 BC charges were brought against Marcus Primus the former proconsul governor of Macedonia for waging a war without prior approval of the Senate on the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace whose king was a Roman ally.161 He was defended by Lucius Licinius Varro Murena who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus ordering him to attack the client state.155 Later Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus.175 Such orders had they been given would have been considered a breach of the Senates prerogative under the constitutional settlement of 27 BC and its aftermathi.e. before Augustus was granted imperium proconsulare maiusas Macedonia was a senatorial province under the Senates jurisdiction not an imperial province under the authority of Augustus. Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of republican restoration as promoted by Augustus and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen a first among equals.155 Even worse the involvement of Marcellus provided some measure of proof that Augustuss policy was to have the youth take his place as princeps instituting a form of monarchy  accusations that had already played out.166 Augustus as Jupiter holding a scepter and orb first half of 
1 st century AD The situation was so serious that Augustus appeared at the trial even though he had not been called as a witness. Under oath Augustus declared that he gave no such order.176 Murena disbelieved Augustuss testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called Augustus replied that he came in the public interest.176175155 Although Primus was found guilty some jurors voted to acquit meaning that not everybody believed Augustuss testimony an insult to the August One.161160 The second settlement was completed in part to allay confusion and formalize Augustuss legal authority to intervene in senatorial provinces. The Senate granted Augustus a form of general imperium proconsulare or proconsular imperium power that applied throughout the empire not solely to his provinces. Moreover the Senate augmented Augustuss proconsular imperium into imperium proconsulare maius or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more maius or greater than that held by the other proconsuls. This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire.170 Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13 BC.168 Additional powers During the second settlement Augustus was also granted the power of a tribune tribunicia potestas for life though not the official title of tribune.170 For some years Augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas the immunity given to a tribune of the plebs. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy renewed annually in perpetuity. Legally it was closed to patricians a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar.169 This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate to preside over elections and to speak first at any meeting.168177 Also included in Augustuss tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the Roman censor these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate.178 Head of Augustus as pontifex maximus Roman artwork of the late Augustan period last decade of the 
1 st century BC With the powers of a censor Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all attire but the classic toga while entering the Forum.179 There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor.180 Julius Caesar had been granted similar powers wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state. However this position did not extend to the censors ability to hold a census and determine the Senates roster. The office of the tribunus plebis began to lose its prestige due to Augustuss amassing of tribunal powers so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the praetorship.181 Augustus was granted sole imperium within the city of Rome in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally proconsuls Roman province governors lost their proconsular imperium when they crossed the Pomeriumthe sacred boundary of Romeand entered the city. In these situations Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul which meant that when he was in the city he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or auctoritas his wishes would usually be obeyed but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum the Senate voted that Augustuss imperium proconsulare maius superior proconsular power should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.182 In addition the credit was given to Augustus for each subsequent Roman military victory after this time because the majority of Romes armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the legatus who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover if a battle was fought in a senatorial province Augustuss proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of or credit for any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph a tradition that began with Romulus Romes first king and first triumphant general.183 Tiberius Augustuss eldest stepson by Livia was the only other general to receive a triumphfor victories in Germania in 7 BC.184 Normally during republican times the powers Augustus held even after the second settlement would have been split between several people who would each exercise them with the assistance of a colleague and for a specific period of time. Augustus held them all at once by himself and with no time limits even those that nominally had time limits were automatically renewed whenever they lapsed.185 Conspiracy A colossal statue of Augustus from the Augusteum of Herculaneum seated and wearing a laurel wreath Many of the political subtleties of the second settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the plebeian class who were Augustuss greatest supporters and clientele. This caused them to insist upon Augustuss participation in imperial affairs from time to time. Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22 BC and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In 22 21 and 19 BC the people rioted in response and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus.186 Likewise there was a food shortage in Rome in 22 BC which sparked panic while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis. After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate Augustus finally accepted authority over Romes grain supply by virtue of his proconsular imperium and ended the crisis almost immediately.168 It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a praefectus annonae a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for Rome.187 There were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the second settlement and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio.173174 Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio.188189 Murena the outspoken consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus affair was named among the conspirators. The conspirators were tried in absentia with Tiberius acting as prosecutor the jury found them guilty but it was not a unanimous verdict.161190 All the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed as soon as they were capturedwithout ever giving testimony in their defence.191190 Augustus ensured that the faade of Republican government continued with an effective coverup of the events.190 In 19 BC the Senate granted Augustus a form of general consular imperium which was probably imperium consulare maius like the proconsular powers that he received in 23 BC. Like his tribune authority the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold.192 In addition Augustus was allowed to wear the consuls insignia in public and before the Senate182 as well as to sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the fasces an emblem of consular authority.192 This seems to have assuaged the populace regardless of whether or not Augustus was a consul the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary. On 6 March 12 BC after the death of Lepidus he additionally took up the position of pontifex maximus the high priest of the college of the pontiffs the most important position in Roman religion.lm On 5 February 2 BC Augustus was also given the title pater patriae or father of the country.197198 Stability and staying power Bust of Augustus wearing the Civic Crown at Glyptothek Munich A final reason for the second settlement was to give the principate constitutional stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regimes existence hung by the thin thread of the life of one man Augustus himself who had several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life.199 If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus the Ides of March the proscriptions Philippi and Actium barely twentyfive years distant were still vivid in the minds of many citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon Agrippa for five years similar to Augustuss power in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustuss imperial provinces east and west perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.200 Augustuss accumulation of powers was now complete. War and expansion Main article Wars of Augustus Further information RomanIranian relations and Augustus Eastern policy By AD 13 Augustus boasted 21 occasions where his troops proclaimed him imperator after a successful battle. Almost the entire fourth chapter in his publicly released memoirs of achievements known as the Res Gestae is devoted to his military victories and honors.201 Augustus also promoted the ideal of a superior Roman civilization with a task of ruling the world to the extent to which the Romans knew it a sentiment embodied in words that the contemporary poet Virgil attributes to a legendary ancestor of Augustus tu regere imperio populos Romane memento1
79 Roman remember to rule the Earths peoples with authority The impulse for expansionism was apparently prominent among all classes at Rome and it is accorded divine sanction by Virgils Jupiter in Book 1 of the Aeneid where Jupiter promises Rome imperium sine fine sovereignty without end.202 By the end of his reign the armies of Augustus had conquered northern Hispania modern Spain and Portugal and the Alpine regions of Raetia and Noricum modern Switzerland Bavaria Austria Slovenia Illyricum and Pannonia modern Albania Croatia Hungary Serbia etc. and had extended the borders of Africa Proconsularis to the east and south. Judea was added to the province of Syria when Augustus deposed Herod Archelaus successor to client king Herod the Great. Syria like Egypt after Antony was governed by a high prefect of the equestrian class rather than by a proconsul or legate of Augustus.203 Bust of Tiberius a successful military commander under Augustus who was designated as his heir and successor Again no military effort was needed in 25 BC when Galatia part of modern Turkey was converted to a Roman province shortly after Amyntas of Galatia was killed by an avenging widow of a slain prince from Homonada.203 The rebellious tribes of Asturias and Cantabria in modernday Spain were finally quelled in 19 BC and the territory fell under the provinces of Hispania and Lusitania. This region proved to be a major asset in funding Augustuss future military campaigns as it was rich in mineral deposits that could be fostered in Roman mining projects especially the very rich gold deposits at Las Mdulas.204 Muziris in the Chera Kingdom of Southern India as shown in the Tabula Peutingeriana with depiction of a Temple of Augustus Templum Augusti an illustration of IndoRoman relations in the period Conquering the peoples of the Alps in 16 BC was another important victory for Rome since it provided a large territorial buffer between the Roman citizens of Italy and Romes enemies in Germania to the north.205 Horace dedicated an ode to the victory while the monumental Trophy of Augustus near Monaco was built to honor the occasion.206 The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12 BC when Tiberius began the offensive against the Pannonian tribes of Illyricum and his brother Nero Claudius Drusus moved against the Germanic tribes of the eastern Rhineland. Both campaigns were successful as Drususs forces reached the Elbe River by 9 BCthough he died shortly after by falling off his horse.207 It was recorded that the pious Tiberius walked in front of his brothers body all the way back to Rome.208 To protect Romes eastern territories from the Parthian Empire Augustus relied on the client states of the east to act as territorial buffers and areas that could raise their own troops for defense. To ensure security of the empires eastern flank Augustus stationed a Roman army in Syria while his skilled stepson Tiberius negotiated with the Parthians as Romes diplomat to the East.209 Tiberius was responsible for restoring Tigranes V to the throne of the Kingdom of Armenia.208 Arguably his greatest diplomatic achievement was negotiating with Phraates IV of Parthia 372 BC in 20 BC for the return of the battle standards lost by Crassus in the Battle of Carrhae a symbolic victory and great boost of morale for Rome.208209210 Werner Eck claims that this was a great disappointment for Romans seeking to avenge Crassuss defeat by military means.211 However Maria Brosius explains that Augustus used the return of the standards as propaganda symbolizing the submission of Parthia to Rome. The event was celebrated in art such as the breastplate design on the statue Augustus of Prima Porta and in monuments such as the Temple of Mars Ultor Mars the Avenger built to house the standards.212213 Parthia had always posed a threat to Rome in the east but the real battlefront was along the Rhine and Danube rivers.209 Before the final fight with Antony Octavians campaigns against the tribes in Dalmatia were the first step in expanding Roman dominions to the Danube.214 Victory in battle was not always a permanent success as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Romes enemies in Germania.209 Der siegreich vordringende Hermann The Victorious Advancing Hermann depiction of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest by Peter Janssen 1873 A prime example of Roman loss in battle was the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in AD 9 where three entire legions led by Publius Quinctilius Varus were destroyed by Arminius leader of the Cherusci an apparent Roman ally.215 Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland to pacify it which had some success although the battle brought the end to Roman expansion into Germany.216 The Roman general Germanicus took advantage of a Cherusci civil war between Arminius and Segestes at the Battle of Idistaviso in AD 16 he defeated Arminius.217 Death and succession Augustus in a late 
16 thcentury copper engraving by Giovanni Battista Cavalieri. From the book Romanorum Imperatorum effigies 1583 preserved in the Municipal Library of Trento Italy The illness of Augustus in 23 BC brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public. To ensure stability he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small undramatic and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed to Augustuss unofficial position of power he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.218 Some Augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sisters son Marcellus who had been quickly married to Augustuss daughter Julia the Elder.219 Other historians dispute this since Augustuss will was read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23 BC220 indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa who was Augustuss second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the empire together.221 After the death of Marcellus in 23 BC Augustus married his daughter to Agrippa. This union produced five children three sons and two daughters Gaius Caesar Lucius Caesar Vipsania Julia Agrippina and Agrippa Postumus so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the second settlement Agrippa was granted a fiveyear term of administering the eastern half of the empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to Augustus although not trumping Augustuss authority his seat of governance stationed at Samos in the eastern Aegean.221222 This granting of power showed Augustuss favor for Agrippa but it was also a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.222 Augustuss intent became apparent to make his grandsons Gaius and Lucius his heirs when he adopted them as his own children.223 He took the consulship in 5 and 2 BC so that he could personally usher them into their political careers224 and they were nominated for the consulships of AD 1 and 
4.2 25 Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons Livias children from her first marriage Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus henceforth referred to as Drusus and Tiberius Claudius henceforth Tiberius granting them military commands and public office though seeming to favor Drusus. After Agrippa died in 12 BC Tiberius was ordered to divorce his own wife Vipsania Agrippina and marry Augustuss widowed daughter Julia as soon as a period of mourning for Agrippa had ended.226 Drususs marriage to Augustuss niece Antonia was considered an unbreakable affair whereas Vipsania was only the daughter of the late Agrippa from his first marriage.226 Tiberius shared in Augustuss tribune powers as of 6 BC but shortly thereafter went into retirement reportedly wanting no further role in politics while he exiled himself to Rhodes.184227 No specific reason is known for his departure though it could have been a combination of reasons including a failing marriage with Julia184227 as well as a sense of envy and exclusion over Augustuss apparent favouring of the younger Gaius and Lucius. Gaius and Lucius joined the college of priests at an early age were presented to spectators in a more favorable light and were introduced to the army in Gaul.228229 After the deaths of both Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively and the earlier death of his brother Drusus 9 BC Tiberius was recalled to Rome in June AD 4 where he was adopted by Augustus on the condition that he in turn adopt his nephew Germanicus.230 This continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs.226 In that year Tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him and by AD 13 was awarded with his second triumph and equal level of imperium with that of Augustus.231 The deified Augustus hovers over Tiberius and other JulioClaudians in the Great Cameo of France. The only other possible claimant as heir was Agrippa Postumus who had been exiled by Augustus in AD 7 his banishment made permanent by senatorial decree and Augustus officially disowned him. He certainly fell out of Augustuss favor as an heir the historian Erich S. Gruen notes various contemporary sources that state Agrippa Postumus was a vulgar young man brutal and brutish and of depraved character.232 On 19 August AD 14233234 Augustus died while visiting Nola where his father had died. Both Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that Livia was rumored to have brought about Augustuss death by poisoning fresh figs.235236 This element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to Augustuss life but some historians view it as likely to have been a salacious fabrication made by those who had favoured Postumus as heir or other of Tiberiuss political enemies. Livia had long been the target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son most or all of which are unlikely to have been true.237 Alternatively it is possible that Livia did supply a poisoned fig she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder. Augustuss health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as his choice of heir.238 It is likely that Augustus was not expected to return alive from Nola but it seems that his health improved once there it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius in order to not endanger that transition.237 The Mausoleum of Augustus restored 2021 Augustuss famous last words were Have I played the part well Then applaud as I exit Acta est fabula plauditereferring to the playacting and regal authority that he had put on as emperor. An enormous funerary procession of mourners traveled with Augustuss body from Nola to Rome and all public and private businesses closed on the day of his burial.238 Tiberius and his son Drusus delivered the eulogy while standing atop two rostra. Augustuss body was coffinbound and cremated on a pyre close to his mausoleum. It was proclaimed that Augustus joined the company of the gods as a member of the Roman pantheon.239 Historian D. C. A. Shotter states that Augustuss policy of favoring the Julian family line over the Claudian might have afforded Tiberius sufficient cause to show open disdain for Augustus after the latters death instead Tiberius was always quick to rebuke those who criticized Augustus.240 Shotter suggests that Augustuss deification obliged Tiberius to suppress any open resentment that he might have harbored coupled with Tiberiuss extremely conservative attitude towards religion.241 Also historian R. ShawSmith points to letters of Augustus to Tiberius which display affection towards Tiberius and high regard for his military merits.242 Shotter states that Tiberius focused his anger and criticism on Gaius Asinius Gallus for marrying Vipsania after Augustus forced Tiberius to divorce her as well as toward the two young Caesars Gaius and Luciusinstead of Augustus the real architect of his divorce and imperial demotion.241 Legacy Further information Cultural depictions of Augustus The Virgin Mary and Child the prophetess Sibyl Tivoli bottom left and the emperor Augustus in the bottom right from the Trs Riches Heures du duc de Berry. The likeness of Augustus is that of the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos.243 The Augustus cameo at the center of the Medieval Cross of Lothair Augustus created a regime which maintained peace and prosperity in the Roman west and the Greek east for two centuries. Its dominance also laid the foundations of a concept of universal empire in the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empires down to their dissolutions in 1453 and 1806 respectively.244 Both his adoptive surname Caesar and his title Augustus became the permanent titles of the rulers of the Roman Empire for fourteen centuries after his death in use both at Old Rome and at New Rome. In many languages Caesar became the word for emperor as in the German Kaiser and in the Bulgarian and subsequently Russian Tsar sometimes Csar or Czar. The cult of Divus Augustus continued until the state religion of the empire was changed to Christianity in 391 by Theodosius I. Consequently there are many statues and busts of the first emperor. He had composed an account of his achievements the Res Gestae Divi Augusti to be inscribed in bronze in front of his mausoleum.245 Copies of the text were inscribed throughout the empire upon his death.246 The inscriptions in Latin featured translations in Greek beside it and were inscribed on many public edifices such as the temple in Ankara dubbed the Monumentum Ancyranum called the queen of inscriptions by historian Theodor Mommsen.247 The Res Gestae is the only work to have survived from antiquity though Augustus is also known to have composed poems entitled Sicily Epiphanus and Ajax an autobiography of 13 books a philosophical treatise and a written rebuttal to Brutuss Eulogy of Cato.248 Historians are able to analyze excerpts of letters penned by Augustus preserved in other works to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life.242249250 Many consider Augustus to be Romes greatest emperor his policies certainly extended the empires life span and initiated the celebrated Pax Romana or Pax Augusta. The Roman Senate wished subsequent emperors to be more fortunate than Augustus and better than Trajan. Augustus was intelligent decisive and a shrewd politician but he was not perhaps as charismatic as Julius Caesar and was influenced on occasion by Livia sometimes for the worse. Nevertheless his legacy proved more enduring. The city of Rome was utterly transformed under Augustus with Romes first institutionalized police force firefighting force and the establishment of the municipal prefect as a permanent office. The police force was divided into cohorts of 500 men each while the units of firemen ranged from 500 to 1000 men each with 7 units assigned to 14 divided city sectors.251 A praefectus vigilum or Prefect of the Watch was put in charge of the vigiles Romes fire brigade and police.252 With Romes civil wars at an end Augustus was also able to create a standing army for the Roman Empire fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170000 soldiers.253 This was supported by numerous auxiliary units of 500 noncitizen soldiers each often recruited from recently conquered areas.254 With his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout Italy Augustus installed an official courier system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the praefectus vehiculorum.255 Besides the advent of swifter communication among Italian polities his extensive building of roads throughout Italy also allowed Romes armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country.256 In the year 6 Augustus established the aerarium militare donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers.257 One of the most enduring institutions of Augustus was the establishment of the Praetorian Guard in 27 BC originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome.258 They had the power to intimidate the Senate install new emperors and depose ones they disliked the last emperor they served was Maxentius as it was Constantine I who disbanded them in the early 
4 th century and destroyed their barracks the Castra Praetoria.259 Augustus as Roman pharaoh in an Egyptianstyle depiction a stone carving of the Kalabsha Temple in Nubia Although the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29 BC Augustus gave 400 sesterces equal to 110 of a Roman pound of gold each to 250000 citizens 1000 sesterces each to 120000 veterans in the colonies and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon.260 He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities.260 In 28 BC he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.260 The longevity of Augustuss reign and its legacy to the Roman world should not be overlooked as a key factor in its success. As Tacitus wrote the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the principate.261 Had Augustus died earlier matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus therefore must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a de facto monarchy in these years. Augustuss own experience his patience his tact and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the empire down many lasting paths from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession to the embellishment of the capital at the emperors expense. Augustuss ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every emperor of Rome adopted his name Caesar Augustus which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title.239 The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome an upholder of moral justice and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.262 However for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages. The contemporary Roman jurist Marcus Antistius Labeo fond of the days of preAugustan republican liberty in which he had been born openly criticized the Augustan regime. In the beginning of his Annals Tacitus wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery. He continued to say that with Augustuss death and swearing of loyalty to Tiberius the people of Rome traded one slaveholder for another.263 In a 2006 biography on Augustus Anthony Everitt asserts that through the centuries judgments on Augustuss reign have oscillated between these two extremes. Tacitus was of the belief that Nerva r. 9698 successfully mingled two formerly alien ideas principate and liberty.264 The 
3 rdcentury historian Cassius Dio acknowledged Augustus as a benign moderate ruler yet like most other historians after the death of Augustus Dio viewed Augustus as an autocrat.263 The poet Marcus Annaeus Lucanus AD 3965 was of the opinion that Caesars victory over Pompey and the fall of Cato the Younger 95 BC46 BC marked the end of traditional liberty in Rome historian Chester Starr writes of his avoidance of criticizing Augustus perhaps Augustus was too sacred a figure to accuse directly.264 The AngloIrish writer Jonathan Swift 16671745 in his Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome criticized Augustus for installing tyranny over Rome and likened what he believed Great Britains virtuous constitutional monarchy to Romes moral Republic of the 
2 nd century BC. In his criticism of Augustus the admiral and historian Thomas Gordon 16581741 compared Augustus to the puritanical tyrant Oliver Cromwell 159916
58.2 65 Thomas Gordon and the French political philosopher Montesquieu 16891755 both remarked that Augustus was a coward in battle.266 In his Memoirs of the Court of Augustus the Scottish scholar Thomas Blackwell 17011757 deemed Augustus a Machiavellian ruler a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper wicked and worthless a mean spirit and a tyrant.266 Revenue reforms Coin of Augustus found at the Pudukottai hoard from an ancient Tamil country Pandyan Kingdom of presentday Tamil Nadu in India a testimony to IndoRoman trade. British Museum. Caption AVGVSTVS DIVI FILIVS. The vertical slice not part of the original design was likely an old test cut to make sure the coin was solid rather than a fourre. Augustuss public revenue reforms had a great impact on the subsequent success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empires expanded land base under consistent direct taxation from Rome instead of exacting varying intermittent and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustuss predecessors had done. This reform greatly increased Romes net revenue from its territorial acquisitions stabilized its flow and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.267 
1 st century coin of the Himyarite Kingdom southern coast of the Arabian peninsula. This is also an imitation of a coin of Augustus. The measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population census with fixed quotas for each province. Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces. Indirect taxes included a 4 tax on the price of slaves a 1 tax on goods sold at auction and a 5 tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100000 sesterces by persons other than the next of kin.268 An equally important reform was the abolition of private tax farming which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors who collected taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era. Some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome. These tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations great private wealth and the right to tax local areas.267 The use of Egypts immense land rents to finance the Empires operations resulted from Augustuss conquest of Egypt and the shift to a Roman form of government.269 As it was effectively considered Augustuss private property rather than a province of the Empire it became part of each succeeding emperors patrimonium.270 Instead of a legate or proconsul Augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer Egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming Prefect of the Praetorian Guard.271 The highly productive agricultural land of Egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to Augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions.269 Month of August The month of August Latin Augustus is named after Augustus until his time it was called Sextilis named so because it had been the sixth month of the original Roman calendar and the Latin word for six is sex. Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesars July but this is an invention of the 
13 th century scholar Johannes de Sacrobosco. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed and it was not chosen for its length see Julian calendar. According to a senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power culminating in the fall of Alexandria fell in that month.272 Creation of Italia Roman Italy was established by Augustus in 7 BC with the Latin name Italia. This was the first time that the Italian peninsula was united administratively and politically under the same name. Due to this act Augustus was called the Father of Italy by Italian historians such as G. Giannelli.273 Building projects Further information Vitruvius and De architectura Close up on the sculpted detail of the Ara Pacis Altar of Peace 13 BC to 9 BC On his deathbed Augustus boasted I found a Rome of bricks I leave to you one of marble. Although there is some truth in the literal meaning of this Cassius Dio asserts that it was a metaphor for the Empires strength.274 Marble could be found in buildings of Rome before Augustus but it was not extensively used as a building material until the reign of Augustus.275 Although this did not apply to the Subura slums which were still as rickety and fireprone as ever he did leave a mark on the monumental topography of the centre and of the Campus Martius with the Ara Pacis Altar of Peace and monumental sundial whose central gnomon was an obelisk taken from Egypt.276 The relief sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustuss triumphs in the Res Gestae. Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians the Vestals and the citizenry of Rome.277 He also built the Temple of Caesar the Temple of Jupiter Tonans the Temple of Apollo Palatinus and the Baths of Agrippa and the Forum of Augustus with its Temple of Mars Ultor.278 Other projects were either encouraged by him such as the Theatre of Balbus and Agrippas construction of the Pantheon or funded by him in the name of others often relations e.g. Portico of Octavia Theatre of Marcellus. Even his Mausoleum of Augustus was built before his death to house members of his family.279 To celebrate his victory at the Battle of Actium the Arch of Augustus was built in 29 BC near the entrance of the Temple of Castor and Pollux and widened in 19 BC to include a triplearch design.275 The Temple of Augustus and Livia in Vienne late 
1 st century BC After the death of Agrippa in 12 BC a solution had to be found in maintaining Romes water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense. In that year Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Romes aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.251 In the late Augustan era the commission of five senators called the curatores locorum publicorum iudicandorum translated as Supervisors of Public Property was put in charge of maintaining public buildings and temples of the state cult.251 Augustus created the senatorial group of the curatores viarum translated as Supervisors for Roads for the upkeep of roads this senatorial commission worked with local officials and contractors to organize regular repairs.255 The Corinthian order of architectural style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural style in the age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome. Suetonius once commented that Rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of Rome upon the classical Greek model.275 Residences The official residence of Augustus was the Domus Augusti on the Palatine which he made into a palace after buying it in 4140 BC.280 He had other residences such as the horti maecenati in Rome where Augustus preferred to stay whenever he became ill and which Maecenas left to him in his will in 8 BC. The great villa of Vedius Pollio at Posilipo near Naples was beqeathed probably forced to him in 15 BC.281 Augustus built the Palazzo a Mare palace on Capri.282 He also built the immense Villa Giulia on the island of Ventotene as a summer residence early in his reign. The family home of Augustus was probably the villa at Somma Vesuviana Nola.283 This was the location where he died and where his father also died.284 Physical appearance and official images The veiled head of Emperor Augustus 
1 st century BC National Archaeological Museum of the Marche Region His biographer Suetonius writing about a century after Augustuss death described his appearance as ... unusually handsome and exceedingly graceful at all periods of his life though he cared nothing for personal adornment. He was so far from being particular about the dressing of his hair that he would have several barbers working in a hurry at the same time and as for his beard he now had it clipped and now shaved while at the very same time he would either be reading or writing something ... He had clear bright eyes ... His teeth were wide apart small and illkept his hair was slightly curly and inclined to goldenn his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever so slightly inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. He was short of stature although Julius Marathus his freedman and keeper of his records says that he was five feet and nine inches just under 5 ft. 7 in. or 
1.7 0 meters in modern height measurements but this was concealed by the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside him...286 adding that his shoes were somewhat highsoled to make him look taller than he really was.287 Scientific analysis of traces of paint found in his official statues shows that he most likely had light brown hair and eyes his hair and eyes were depicted as the same color.288 The Mero Head of Augustus bronze Roman portraiture bust from Mero Kingdom of Kush Nubia modern Sudan 2725 BC His official images were very tightly controlled and idealized drawing from a tradition of Hellenistic portraiture rather than the tradition of realism in Roman portraiture. He first appeared on coins at the age of 19 and from about 29 BC the explosion in the number of Augustan portraits attests a concerted propaganda campaign aimed at dominating all aspects of civil religious economic and military life with Augustuss person.289 The early images did indeed depict a young man but although there were gradual changes his images remained youthful until he died in his seventies by which time they had a distanced air of ageless majesty according to the classicist R. R. R. Smith.290 Among the best known of many surviving portraits are the Augustus of Prima Porta the image on the Ara Pacis and the Via Labicana Augustus which depicts him in his role as pontifex maximus. Several cameo portraits include the Blacas Cameo and Gemma Augustea. See also Augustan and JulioClaudian art Augustan literature ancient Rome IndoRoman trade relations JulioClaudian family tree Temple of Augustus Notes  The dates of his rule are contemporary dates Augustus lived under two calendars the Roman Republican until 45 BC and the Julian calendar after 45 BC. Due to departures from Julius Caesars intentions Augustus finished restoring the Julian calendar in March AD 4 and the correspondence between the proleptic Julian calendar and the calendar observed in Rome is uncertain before 8 BC.1  Cassius Dio instead gives him the name Caepias3 probably a corruption of Caesar.  His daughter Julia had died in 54 BC. his son Caesarion by Cleopatra was not recognized by Roman law and was not mentioned in his will.30   aug here refers to the religious office of augur not the title augustus created in 27 BC.73  Marcus Barbatius was a moneyer.73  Appian estimates that 300 senators were proscribed while his earlier contemporary Livy asserted that only 130 senators had been proscribed.76  These were Alexander Helios Cleopatra Selene II and Ptolemy Philadelphus.  Ancient historians however often give him a rule of 56 years. None of them seem to agree on the exact start date though.145146147148149  Cassius Dio 
53.1  indicates that he took the title princeps senatus in 28 BC. However he also states that Augustus added five years to his own terms as princeps since his tenyear period was about to expire this was in the consulship of Publius and Gnaeus Lentulus 18 BC 
54.1 2 meaning that his official tenure as princeps began in 27 BC.  He was first proclaimed imperator on 16 April 43 BC after the Battle of Forum Gallorum.63  He acted on the orders of Marcellus and Augustus155156  The date is provided by inscribed calendars.193194  Dio reports this under 13 BC probably as the year in which Lepidus died195196  According to Adrian Goldsworthy such descriptions of color are hard to judge and may mean brown rather than black hair285 References  Blackburn  HolfordStrevens 2003 pp. 670671.
