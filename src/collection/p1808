29 th Dynasty Nefaarud I or Nayfaurud I better known with his hellenised name Nepherites I was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh the founder of the 
29 th Dynasty in 399 BC. Reignedit Accessionedit It is believed that Nepherites was a general from the deltaic city of Mendes who in the autumn of 399 BC rose against pharaoh Amyrtaeus defeated him in open battle3 and then executed him at Memphis.4 Nepherites then crowned himself pharaoh at Memphis and possibly also at Sais before shifting the capital from Sais to his hometown Mendes.5 The fact that Nepherites I chose the same Horus name of Psamtik I and the Golden Horus name of Amasis II  both relevant rulers of the earlier 
26 th Dynasty  is thought to demonstrate that he wanted to associate his rule with an earlier golden age of Egyptian history.6 Activitiesedit According to Manetho Nepherites I ruled for six years although his highest archaeologically attested date is his regnal year 
4.5  Evidence of Nepherites building work has been found in a number of locations across the country. In Lower Egypt he is attested at Thmuis Buto where a statue of him has been found7 Memphis Saqqara where an Apis burial took place in his regnal year 2 and his capital and hometown Mendes. In Middle and Upper Egypt he ordered a chapel at Akoris while at Akhmim near Sohag there is evidence of the worship of a statue of him which was placed inside a naos. He also added some buildings at Karnak such as a storeroom and a shrine meant to house a sacred bark.65 A basalt sphinx with his name is now located in the Louvre but it was known to have been brought to Europe as early as the 
16 th century having adorned a fountain at the Villa Borghese gardens Rome.8 In foreign affairs he resumed the policy of Egyptian intervention in the Middle East. As reported by Diodorus Siculus in 396 BC he supported the Spartan king Agesilaus in his war against the Persians the Spartans had conquered Cyprus and Rhodes and were attempting to extend their influence further east. Nepherites supplied the Spartans with 500000 measures of grain and material for 100 triremes. However the cargo reached Rhodes just after the Persians managed to retake the island so it was entirely seized by the philoPersian admiral Conon of Athens.910 Death and successionedit A shabti of Nepherites I Nepherites I died during the winter of 394393 BC after a sixyear reign.5 The Demotic Chronicle simply states that his son was allowed to succeed him without providing any name. Nowadays it is generally believed that Nepherites son was Hakor who ruled after him for only a year before being overthrown by an apparently unrelated claimant Psammuthes Hakor however was able to retake the throne the following year.11 Possible tombedit A tomb believed to be that of Nepherites was discovered by a joint team from the University of Toronto and the University of Washington in 1992
93.1 2 Possible ownership of the tomb was identified by the presence of a shabti bearing the name of Nepherites I however definitive proof has not been found.13 Although still containing funerary objects and a large limestone sarcophagus the tomb was believed to have been destroyed by the Persians in 343 BC.12 Ceramic vessels containing fish specimens and fishcovered stelae have been found on the site of Nepheritess funerary complex. The presence of the fish often interpreted as votive offerings could be an indication that the site was previously occupied by a temple of the fishgoddess Hatmehyt.14 See alsoedit Muthis  A conjectural pharaoh once believed to be Nepherites Is son.
