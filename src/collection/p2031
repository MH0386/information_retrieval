Reign dates follow those included on the list of Pharaohs page. Some information is debatable and interpretations of available evidence can vary between Egyptologists. Backgroundedit Nefertari wife of Ramesses II Hatshepsut wife of Thutmose II and later Pharaoh in her own right AhmoseNefertari wife of Ahmose Ankhesenpepi II with her son Pepi II The Pharaohs wives played an important role both in public and private life and would be a source of political and religious power.1 Pharaohs usually had many different wives so that a successor could be guaranteed to succeed him. If a queen succeeded in producing an heir that inherited the throne she would reach a position of great honour as Kings Mother and may be able to rule Egypt on behalf of her son as regent if he was underage.1 While there are many known cases of kings marrying their sisters there were also wives of nonroyal birth such as Tiye and Nefertiti.2 Kings such as Amenhotep III and Ramesses II are known to have married some of their daughters though it is possible these marriages were symbolic and ceremonial rather than incestuous.3 Apart from the chief consort the Pharaoh would have many wives in the harem who could be foreignborn princesses or lowerranking Egyptian women who had little impact on politics.4 While women did occasionally rule as Pharaohs they generally did not rule while married except during the Ptolemaic period. Thus male consorts never existed during the time of the native Egyptian royal dynasties and only Berenice IV and Cleopatra VII are listed as having male consorts who did not rule as Pharaohs. List of female rulers and corulersedit Most Queens included on this page did not rule as Pharaohs. However some did rule in their own right following the deaths of their husbands. Four Queens from the Native Egyptian dynasties are known for certain to have ruled as Female Pharaohs Sobekneferu c. 18061802 BC Possibly wife of Amenemhat IV Hatshepsut c. 14791458 BC Wife of Thutmose II Neferneferuaten c. 13341332 BC Wife of either Akhenaten or Smenkhare depending on her identity Twosret c. 11911189 BC Wife of Seti II There has also been some debate on whether certain Queen regents such as Neithotep Merneith Khentkaus I and Khentkaus II did rule as Female Pharaohs or not. However there is yet to be any concrete evidence that they did. The legendary Queen Nitocris was supposedly a Pharaoh at the end of the Sixth Dynasty but no archeological evidence supports her existence. The Ptolemaic Dynasty implemented a policy of corule between spouses starting with Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II. Therefore most Queens from this dynasty are not listed as consorts as they were corulers of Egypt while married to their husbands. The following is a list of Female rulers and corulers of the Ptolemaic Dynasty Arsinoe II c. 277270 BC ruled alongside her brotherhusband Ptolemy II. Berenice II c. 244222 BC ruled alongside her husband Ptolemy III. Arsinoe III 220204 BC ruled alongside her brotherhusband Ptolemy IV. Cleopatra I 193176 BC ruled alongside her husband Ptolemy V and as a regent on behalf of her son Ptolemy VI. Cleopatra II 175164 163127 124116 BC ruled alongside her brotherhusband Ptolemy VI her younger brother later husband Ptolemy VIII her son Ptolemy VII her daughter Cleopatra III and briefly her grandson Ptolemy IX. She was the sole ruler of Egypt from 131 to 127 BC the first woman to do so since Twosret over a millennia before. Cleopatra III 142131 127101 BC ruled alongside her unclehusband Ptolemy VIII her mother Cleopatra II her eldest son Ptolemy IX her daughter Cleopatra IV and her second eldest son Ptolemy X. Cleopatra IV 116115 BC briefly ruled alongside her brotherhusband Ptolemy IX and mother Cleopatra III before being pushed out by her mother. Berenice III 10188 8180 BC ruled alongside her unclehusband Ptolemy X her father Ptolemy IX and her brotherhusband Ptolemy XI. She briefly ruled by herself from 81 BC to 80 BC before she was murdered on the orders of Ptolemy XI. Cleopatra V 7968 BC ruled alongside her husband Ptolemy XII. Cleopatra VI 5857 BC ruled alongside her sister Berenice IV. However some historians theorise she may actually be the same person as Cleopatra V. Berenice IV 5855 BC briefly ruled alongside her sister or possibly mother Cleopatra VI but otherwise spent most of her reign as the sole ruler of Egypt. Cleopatra VII 5130 BC ruled alongside her father Ptolemy XII her brotherhusband Ptolemy XIII her second brotherhusband Ptolemy XIV and her son Ptolemy XV. Arsinoe IV 4847 BC ruled alongside her brother Ptolemy XIII in opposition to their sister Cleopatra VII. List of regentsedit Occasionally when the new Pharaoh was too young to rule his mother or stepmother would rule temporarily as a regent on his behalf. Because they did not hold the title of King during their time in power they are generally not included on Lists of Pharaohs. The following Queens are likely to have ruled as regents Neithhotep possibly ruled on behalf of her son HorAha c. 3050 Merneith ruled on behalf of her son Den c. 2970 Nimaathap possibly ruled on behalf of her son Djoser c. 2670 Khentkaus I likely ruled as a regent but her son or sons are unknown. Khentkaus II possibly ruled as a regent for one of her sons Neferefre or Nyuserre Ini. Iput I possibly ruled as a regent for her son Pepi I c. 2332 Ankhesenpepi II ruled as a regent for her son Pepi II c. 2278 Ahhotep I ruled as a regent for her son Ahmose I c. 1550 AhmoseNefertari ruled as a regent for her son Amenhotep I c. 1541 Hatshepsut initially ruled as a regent for her stepson Thutmose III c. 1479 before becoming Pharaoh and coruler.

Pyramid of Khentkaus I There has been much debate around this queens identity. She may have ruled as regent for one or more of her sons.38 Alternatively her titles suggest that she may have ruled as Pharaoh in her own right but this is disputed. She may have been in fact a wife of Shepseskaf or the ephemeral Thamphthis rather than Userkaf. She may even be the same person as Thampthis but this is not a widely accepted theory.39 Neferhetepes Userkaf40   Sahure40 Meretnebty41 Pyramid complex of Queen Neferhetepes  Meretnebty Sahure42 Userkaf Neferhetepes 41 Neferirkare Kakai43 Horemsaf 36 Netjerirenre 36 Khakare 36 Nebankhre 36 Shepseskare    Known in older studies as Neferethanebty42 Khentkaus II Neferirkare Kakai35   Neferefre42 Nyuserre Ini42  Pyramid of Khentkaus II May have ruled as regent or as Pharaoh in her own right.
