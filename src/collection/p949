August 2016 Learn how and when to remove this message Perspective view of a reconstruction of the Semna West Fort Location of Semna along the Nile in Nubia The region of Semna is 15 miles south of Wadi Halfa and is situated where rocks cross the Nile narrowing its flowthe Semna Cataract.12 Semna was a fortified area established in the reign of Senusret I 19651920 BC on the west bank of the Nile at the southern end of a series of Middle Kingdom fortresses founded during the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt 19851795 BC in the SecondCataract area of Lower Nubia. There are three forts at Semna Semna West Semna Gharb Semna East Semna Sherq also called Kummeh or Kumma and Semna South Semna Gubli.3 The forts to the east and west of the Semna Cataract are Semna East and West respectively Semna South is approximately one kilometer south of Semna West on the west bank of the Nile.34 The Semna gorge at the southern edge of ancient Egypt was the narrowest part of the Nile valley. It was here at this strategic location that the 
12 th Dynasty pharaohs built a cluster of four mudbrick fortresses Semna Kumma Semna South and Uronarti  all covered by the waters of Lake Nasser since the completion of the Aswan Dam in 1971. Many of its monuments were relocated as part of the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia. Archaeology of Semnaedit The rectangular Kumma fortress the Lshaped Semna fortress on the opposite bank and the smaller square fortress of Semna South were each investigated by the American archaeologist George Reisner in 1924 and 1928. Semna and Kumma also included the remains of temples houses and cemeteries dating to the New Kingdom 15501069 BC which would have been roughly contemporary with such lower Nubian towns as Amara West and Sesebisudla when the second cataract region had become part of an Egyptian empire rather than simply a frontier zone. Semna  Kumma forts view from west The fort had several advanced features  the mudbrick walls were reinforced with logs there were doubly fortified gates there was a fortified corridor down to the Nile allowing ready access to water supplies. The logs increased the vulnerability to fire and traces of fires can be seen in the walls. Semna South Fortedit As a 
12 th Dynasty fort Semna South is one of 17 Middle Kingdom Egyptian forts in Nubia built for the purpose of controlling trade traffic along the Nile. The Egyptian state placed great importance on control of Nubia and its goods. As Reisner 1929 notes the southern products the ebony the ivory the pelts the incense and resin the ostrich feathers the black slaves were as much desired by the kings of the Middle Kingdom as by their forebears.5 Thus forts were built along the Nile to protect the waterway from nomadic tribes and to facilitate the flow of Nubian goods into Egypt.63 Forts surrounding Semna South were excavated by the Joint Egyptian Expedition of Harvard University and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in the 19
20 s3 but Semna South was not formally excavated until the late 19
50 s. The initial excavation of the fort was directed by Jean Vercoutter and Sayed Thabit Hassan Thabit with the Sudan Antiquities Service in 195619

1 H. McDonald personal communication October 22 2012. Site geology and geographyedit Semna South is located in the BatnElHajar Belly of the Rock region of Nubia between the second and third cataracts. As its name implies the BatnElHajar is characterized by bare granite ridges and gullies a narrowed Nile run and heavy deposits of windblown sand.89 Semna is situated above a geological formation known as the Basement Complex this complex is a deposit of Precambrian sedimentary rock and later igneous rock. There is only a thin layer of fertile alluvial soil overlying this complex which results in poor agricultural potential.8 Archaeological excavations of Semna Southedit Counterweight for a necklace with three images of Hathor Semna 13901352 BC. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. While the fort at Semna South was described by Reisner 1929 it was not formally excavated until 19561957 by the Sudan Antiquities Service under the direction of Jean Vercoutter and Sayed Thabit Hassan Thabit.2 This excavation explored the majority fourfifths of the fort and made a limited trial digging in the adjacent Meroitic cemetery.4 Vercoutter 1966 notes that their work was preliminary and by no means complete. He encouraged further investigation of the site it seems of the utmost importance for the history of the site that new excavations are undertaken at Semna South before its flooding under the waters of the new Aswan Dam.10 Beginning in 1966 the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago continued excavating where Vercoutter and colleagues had ended. Between 1966 and 1968 the University of Chicago Oriental Institute Expedition to Sudanese Nubia excavated the remainder of the Semna South fort and the adjacent cemetery. Detailed excavations were conducted of the fort walls a church a dump site and the cemetery.7 To the authors knowledge this was the final archaeological excavation conducted at Semna South. Results and significance of the excavationsedit Results from the 19
50 sedit During the 19561957 field season Vercoutter and colleagues were able to interpret the building plan of the fort. The building is composed of the following features a glacis outer girdle wall an inner ditch a main wall and an open inner space.11 They concluded that the fort was never inhabited permanently rather it was occupied for limited periods of time by men of the garrison coming from the fort at Semna West. Example of a glacis They found little evidence of Middle Kingdom occupation but did discover ruins of a Christian settlement at Semna South. The Christian settlement was not fully excavated by the Sudan Antiquities Service expedition but they did note that the houses had been reconstructed by the Christian inhabitants and that they had built a new stone girdle wall around the west side of the fort.12 They concluded that the Christian settlement had been inhabited by a fairly poor community. Results from the 19
60 sedit Architectural findingsedit Semna stela dated to Senusret IIIs year 16 The 19661968 excavations at Semna South determined contrary to Vercoutter that the fort was permanently occupied from the reign of Senusret I to the first few years of reign of Amenemhat III of the 
12 th Dynasty.1314 Excavations of the church sometimes called the Sheiks tomb revealed that only a portion of the original structure still remained.15 As of 1982 when abkar and abkar published their report they were not able to date the church due to the paucity of pottery within the church or nearby. However they did provide a hypothetical estimate the church in its final that is apsidal form would date to the classic Christian period in Nubia somewhere between the ninth and the first part of the eleventh century A.D..15 This expedition unearthed a great wall which connected the forts at Semna South and Semna West. This wall strengthened the view that the military fortifications in the Semna region were built by the Egyptians in response to the strong pressures and infiltration attempts on the part of southerners during the 
12 th Dynasty allusions to which are found in the wellknown Semna Stela and Semna Dispatches.16 abkar and abkar 1982 speculate that perhaps there was a complex of fortifications which embraced Semna South and West and perhaps other forts in the region but there is no definitive evidence for such a complex. Artefactual findingsedit An area located on the forts northwest side previously called a graveyard occupation site or an encampment and covered in pot sherds was also excavated during the 19661968 field seasons. Upon excavation it was revealed to be a 
12 th Dynasty dump site and was the most significant find for the study of the history of the Semna South fort particularly for the study of its communications with the other forts of the first and second cataract regions.17 The dump site was a series of holes which were initially clay quarries and later utilized as a dumping place for discarded fort objects. Some of the holes were deep and some were shallow the two deepest were K1 and K
4.1 87 Within these holes the discarded objects and pottery sherds were mixed into a loose mass of debris with no discernible stratigraphic layers. The finds within these holes are of great significance. The first is a wellpreserved 
12 th Dynasty axe which according to abkar and abkar 1982 is a rare occurrence in Sudanese and Egyptian Nubia.19 Second pottery sherds of the CGroup type indigenous Nubian inhabitants from ca. 2000  1500 BC were found which suggests a peaceful coexistence between the CGroup individuals and the Egyptians.18620 Third and most importantly were seal impressions on numerous pieces of pottery. The most significant seals are those which bore the name of the fort which until this discovery was only partially known.18 Prior to this seal being found the Egyptian name of the fort at Semna South was written in hieratic as Repressing the on a fragmentary piece of papyrus discovered in 1896 by James Quibell near the Ramesseum.183 After studying these seals Dr. abkar translated the hieroglyphics as Subduer of the SetiuNubians or Subduer of the Setiland.189 This find is important because it officially confirms the Egyptian name of the fort at Semna South and clarifies the fragmentary name written on the Ramesseum papyrus. Additionally it signifies the role of Egypt in Nubia ruler. Bioarchaeological findingsedit The Oriental Institute Expedition also excavated the large cemetery to the north of the fort. This cemetery contained approximately 560 gravesrepresenting over 800 individualsof which about 494 were from the Meroitic period 
4 th century BC  
4 th century AD 50 from the XGroup period 
4 th  
6 th century AD and 16 from the Christian period 550  1500 AD.2122 The Meroitic period through the Christian period is a span of approximately 2000 years which indicates that the fort was used for an extended period of time during Egyptian and Nubian history. The Meroitic graves were oriented east to west and were of several styles rectangular pit graves with superstructures resembling mastabas oblong pits without superstructures and rectangular pits with mudbrick burial vaults.7 For those remains found in situ the heads were oriented to the west and the bodies were extended on their backs with hands over the pelvis.21 Numerous artifacts were found within the Meroitic graves black and brown wear pottery copper and bronze bowls a finely carved wooden bowl a glass ointment jar bronze mirrors copper iron and bronze jewelry beads and pendants hunting equipment leather and fragments of shrouds.23 The graves of the XGroup were oriented north to south and most were deep pits with a lateral chamber.7 Most of the graves according to abkar and abkar 1982 had a shelf composed of earth mudbrick or stones running alongside the chamber which supported the blocking material.24 For the remains found in situ the bodies were in a flexed position on their sides with the heads facing towards the north northwest or south. In most cases a burial shroud was present although it was often fragmentary.24 Objects recovered from these graves are as follows red ware pottery jewelry personal grooming tools hunting equipment leather sandals and clothing.25 The Christian period graves were oriented east to west and most were deep narrow oblong shaft tombs.25 Only one grave had a superstructure. Of the remains in situ the bodies were usually extended and supine with the hands over the pelvis with the heads oriented towards the west. One body was found on its side in a flexed position facing north.25 Most of the bodies were wrapped in a linen or wool shroud which had been secured by a chord.25 Additional analysis of Semna South materialedit The human remains recovered from Semna South have been studied by numerous anthropologists and other specialists. Hrdy 1978 analyzed hair samples from Semna South mummies. He concluded that the hair color of these individuals was lighter than previously thought in ancient Nubia and the hair of the XGroup males was curlier than the Meroitic males.26 In 1993 Arriaza Merbs and Rothschild published a study evaluating the prevalence of a pathological condition known as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis DISH. They found that approximately 13 of the individuals from the Meroitic cemetery were afflicted with this condition and that it was more common among males.27 Alvrus 1999 assessed the skeletal fracture patterns for almost 600 individuals from the Semna South site. She analyzed healed fractures of the skull and appendicular skeleton and found that almost 21 of adults had at least one healed fracture and that the skull was the most frequently injured region of the body. She attributes much of the trauma to the rocky physical environment but also notes that craniofacial trauma may be the result of interpersonal violence.28 Dissertations and theses which used the Semna South remains are numerous. They include topics such as the sexual dimorphism of dental pathology29 the presence of schistosomiasis in ancient Nubia30 nonmetric biological distance analysis31 and a craniometric analysis.32 Conclusionsedit Reconstructed Semna temple of Senusret III now in the National Museum of Sudan. Excavated between 195657 and 196668 Semna South is a 
12 th Dynasty fort located in Nubiathe present Republic of Sudanon the west bank of the Nile. These excavations revealed the building plan of the fort a church a cemetery and numerous other settlementrelated features. Some of the most important discoveries were found within dumps near the fort. In particular abkar recovered pottery seals which provided the Egyptian name of the fort Subduer of the SetiuNubians or Subduer of the Setiland which was unknown until the 19661968 field seasons.189 The artifacts recovered from these excavations including pottery sherds textiles jewelry an axe and additional seals indicate that the fort at Semna South was utilized during the Middle Kingdom. The adjacent cemetery with burials from the Meroitic XGroup and Christian periods suggests a much longer habitation of the region from the Middle Kingdom until the Middle Ages. Archaeological excavations of Semna South have contributed to the overall understanding of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt fort system. These forts established military control over Upper and Lower Nubia and the Nile river transport of commodities and were integral parts of the Egyptian empire. The temples of Dedwen and Sesostris III were moved to the National Museum of Sudan in Khartoum prior to the flooding of Lake Nasser.
