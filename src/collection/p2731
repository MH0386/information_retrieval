12 th Dynasty Amenemhat IV also known as Amenemhet IV was the seventh and penultimate6 king of the late Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt during the late Middle Kingdom period. He arguably ruled around 17861777 BC for about nine regnal years.24 Amenemhat IV may have been the son grandson soninlaw or stepson of his predecessor the powerful Amenemhat III. His reign started with a seemingly peaceful twoyear coregency with Amenemhat III. He undertook expeditions in the Sinai for turquoise in Upper Egypt for amethyst and to the Land of Punt. He also maintained trade relations with Byblos as well as continuing the Egyptian presence in Nubia. Amenemhat IV built some parts of the temple of Hathor at Serabit elKhadim in the Sinai and constructed the wellpreserved temple of Renenutet in Medinet Madi. The tomb of Amenemhat IV has not been identified although the Southern Mazghuna pyramid is a possibility. Amenemhat IV was succeeded by Sobekneferu who may have been his sister or stepsister she was a daughter of Amenemhat III. Her reign marked the end of the Twelfth Dynasty and the beginning of the Middle Kingdoms decline into the Second Intermediate Period. Familyedit See also Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt family tree Amenemhat IVs mother was a woman named Hetepi. Hetepis only known attestation is an inscription on the wall of the temple of Renenutet at Medinet Madi where she is given the title of Kings Mother but not the titles of Kings Wife Kings Daughter or Kings Sister.2 She may or may not have been a wife of Amenemhat III as her titles in relation to Amenemhat III might have been omitted in an inscription from her sons reign. The relationship of Amenemhat IV to Amenemhat III is debated. Amenemhat IV was the son of Amenemhat III according to Manetho but as he isnt called a Kings Son in any known reference to him some historians believe that he was a grandson.27 However there is no record of another son of Amenemhat III and as stated above Hetepti is not known to have been called a Kings Daughter. Manetho states that Amenemhat IV married his sister Sobekneferu who is identified as a royal daughter of Amenemhat III and who eventually ruled in her own right upon the death of Amenemhat IV. However Manethos claim about the marriage has not been proven correct Sobekneferu is not known to have borne the title of Kings Wife among her other titles. Egyptologist Kim Ryholt has alternatively proposed that before marrying Amenemhat III Hetepi had been previously married to another man and that Amenemhat IV came from this marriage thus becoming Sobekneferus stepbrother  which could explain the Manethonian tradition.4 Amenemhat IV may have died without a male heir which could explain why he was succeeded by Sobekneferu.3 This is also disputed as some Egyptologists such as Aidan Dodson and Kim Ryholt have proposed that the first two rulers of the Thirteenth Dynasty Sobekhotep I and Amenemhat Sonbef might be his sons based on the filiative nomen Amenemhat.11 Reignedit Scarabseal of Amenemhat IV 12 Amenemhat IV first came to power as a junior coregent13 of his predecessor Amenemhat III whose reign marks the apex of the Middle Kingdom period. The coregency is well attested by numerous monuments and artefacts where the names of the two kings parallel each other.13 The length of this coregency is uncertain it could have lasted from one to seven years13 although most scholars believe it was only two years long.213 The Turin Canon a king list redacted during the early Ramesside period records Amenemhat IV on Column 6 Row 1 and credits him with a reign of 9 years 3 months and 27 days.4 Amenemhat IV is also recorded on Entry 65 of the Abydos King List and Entry 38 of the Saqqara Tablet both of which date to the New Kingdom. In spite of the Turin canon the duration of Amenemhat IVs reign is uncertain. It was given as eight years under the name Ammenemes in Manethos Aegyptiaca. In any case Amenemhat IVs rule seems to have been peaceful and uneventful. Amenemhat IV is well attested by contemporary artefacts including a number of scarab and cylinderseals.14 Expeditions and foreign relationsedit One of the naos from the funerary temple of Amenemhat III at Hawara now located in the Egyptian Museum at Cairo. The left figure flexing his arm across his chest in order to bring a sign ankh life to the face of his partner is Amenemhat III. The king on the right is Amenemhat IV. Four expeditions to the turquoise mines of Serabit elKhadim in the Sinai are dated to his reign by insitu inscriptions. The latest took place in his ninth year on the throne and could be the last expedition of the Middle Kingdom since the next inscription dates to Ahmose Is reign some 200 years later.2 In his 
2 nd regnal year Amenemhat IV sent another expedition to mine amethyst in the Wadi elHudi in southern Egypt. The leader of the expedition was the assistant treasurer Sahathor.15 Farther south three nilometer records are known from Kumna in Nubia that are explicitly dated to regnal years 5 6 and 7 showing that Egyptian presence in the region was maintained during his lifetime.2 During his reign important trade relations must have existed with the city of Byblos on the coast of modernday Lebanon where an obsidian and gold chest as well as a jar lid bearing Amenemhat IVs name have been found.2 A gold plaque showing Amenemhat IV offering to a deity may also originate there.16 In 2010 a report on continuing excavations at Wadi Gawasis on the Red Sea coast notes the finding of two wooden chests and an ostracon inscribed with a hieratic text mentioning an expedition to the fabled Land of Punt in regnal year 8 of Amenemhat IV under the direction of the royal scribe Djedy.17 Two fragments of a stela depicting Amenemhat IV and dating to his regnal year 7 were found at Berenice on the Red Sea.1819 Building activitiesedit Small obsidian coffer bound in gold and bearing Amenemhat IVs titulary from the Royal necropolis of Byblos Amenemhat IV completed the temple of Renenutet and Sobek at Medinet Madi that had been started by Amenemhat III202122 which is the only intact temple still existing from the Middle Kingdom according to Zahi Hawass former SecretaryGeneral of Egypts Supreme Council of Antiquities SCA.23 The foundations of the temple administrative buildings granaries and residences were uncovered by an Egyptian archaeological expedition in early 2006. It is possible that Amenemhat IV built a temple in the northeastern Fayum at Qasr elSagha.24 Amenemhat IV is responsible for the completion of a shrine at the temple of Hathor in the Sinai25 and may also have undertaken works in Karnak where a pedestal for a sacred barque inscribed with the names of Amenemhat III and Amenemhat IV was found in 19
24.2 26272829 Legacyedit Less than ten years after Amenemhat IVs death the Twelfth Dynasty came to an end and was replaced by the much weaker Thirteenth Dynasty.4 Although the first two rulers of this new dynasty may have been sons of Amenemhat IV political instability quickly became prevalent and kings rarely ruled beyond a couple of years.4 The influx of Asiatic immigrants in the Nile Delta that had started during the reigns of Amenemhat IVs predecessor accelerated under his own reign becoming completely unchecked.30 Under the Thirteenth Dynasty the Asiatic population of the Delta founded an independent kingdom ruled by kings of Canaanite descent forming the Fourteenth Dynasty that reigned from Avaris.4 Approximately 80 years after the reign of Amenemhat IV the administration of the Egyptian state seems to have completely collapsed4 marking the start of the Second Intermediate Period. Tombedit Main article Southern Mazghuna pyramid The remains of the Southern Mazghuna pyramid possibly Amenemhat IVs tomb31 The tomb of Amenemhat IV has not been identified. Nonetheless he often is associated with the ruined Southern Mazghuna pyramid. No inscriptions have been found within the pyramid to determine the identity of its owner but its architectural similarity31 with the second pyramid of Amenemhat III at Hawara has led Egyptologists to date the pyramid to the late Twelfth Dynasty or early Thirteenth Dynasty.32 Less likely Amenemhat IV could have been interred in Amenemhat IIIs first pyramid in Dahshur since his name has been found on an inscription in the mortuary temple.2 At Dahshur next to the pyramid of Amenemhat II the remains of another pyramid dating to the Middle Kingdom were discovered during building work. The pyramid has not yet been excavated but a fragment inscribed with the royal name Amenemhat has been unearthed. It is possible that this pyramid belongs to Amenemhat IV although there are also kings of the Thirteenth Dynasty that bore the name Amenemhat and who could have built the pyramid. Alternatively the relief fragment could have originated at the nearby pyramid of Amenemhat II.33 See alsoedit List of pharaohs Referencesedit  The sphinx BM EA58892 on the catalog of the British Museum  a b c d e f g h i j Darrell D.
