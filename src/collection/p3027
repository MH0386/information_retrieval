He was a member of the NervaAntonine dynasty. Verus succession together with Marcus Aurelius marked the first time that the Roman Empire was ruled by more than one emperor simultaneously an increasingly common occurrence in the later history of the Empire. Born on 15 December 130 he was the eldest son of Lucius Aelius Caesar first adopted son and heir to Hadrian. Raised and educated in Rome he held several political offices prior to taking the throne. After his biological fathers death in 138 he was adopted by Antoninus Pius who was himself adopted by Hadrian. Hadrian died later that year and Antoninus Pius succeeded to the throne. Antoninus Pius would rule the empire until 161 when he died and was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius who later raised his adoptive brother Verus to coemperor. As emperor the majority of his reign was occupied by his direction of the war with Parthia which ended in Roman victory and some territorial gains. After initial involvement in the Marcomannic Wars he fell ill and died in 169. He was deified by the Roman Senate as the Divine Verus Divus Verus. Early life family and careeredit Early life and familyedit Lucius Verus as a child Bust of Antoninus Pius Born Lucius Ceionius Commodus on 15 December 130 Verus was the firstborn son of Avidia and Lucius Aelius Caesar the first adopted son and heir of Emperor Hadrian.2 He was born and raised in Rome. Verus had another brother Gaius Avidius Ceionius Commoduscitation needed and two sisters Ceionia Fabia and Ceionia Plautia.2 His maternal grandparents were the senator Gaius Avidius Nigrinus and the unattested noblewoman Plautia. Although Hadrian was his adoptive paternal grandfather his biological paternal grandparents were the consul Lucius Ceionius Commodus and either Aelia or Fundania Plautia.citation needed Careeredit When his father died in early 138 Hadrian chose Antoninus Pius 86161 as his successor. Antoninus was adopted by Hadrian on the condition that Verus and Hadrians greatnephew Marcus Aurelius be adopted by Antoninus as his sons and heirs.citation needed By this scheme Verus who was already Hadrians adoptive grandson through his natural father remained as such through his new father Antoninus. The adoption of Marcus Aurelius was probably a suggestion of Antoninus himself since Marcus was the nephew of Antoninus wife.citation needed Immediately after Hadrians death Antoninus approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended Marcus betrothal to Ceionia Fabia would be annulled and he would be betrothed to Faustina Antoninus daughter instead. Faustinas betrothal to Ceionias brother Lucius Commodus would also have to be annulled. Marcus consented to Antoninus proposal.3 As a prince and future emperor Verus received careful education from the famous grammaticus Marcus Cornelius Fronto.citation needed He was reported to have been an excellent student fond of writing poetry and delivering speeches. Verus started his political career as a quaestor in 153 became consul in 154 and in 161 was consul again with Marcus Aurelius as his senior partner.citation needed Emperoredit Main article Reign of Marcus Aurelius Denarius of Lucius Verus. Inscription L. VERVS AVG. ARMENIACVS Accession of Lucius and Marcus 1
61 edit Antoninus died on 7 March 161 and was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius. Marcus Aurelius bore deep affection for Antoninus as evidenced by the first book of Meditations.4 Although the senate planned to confirm Marcus alone he refused to take office unless Lucius received equal powers.5 The senate accepted granting Lucius the imperium the tribunician power and the name Augustus.6 Marcus became in official titulature Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus Lucius forgoing his name Commodus and taking Marcuss family name Verus became Imperator Caesar Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus.
7 notes 1 It was the first time that Rome was ruled by two emperors.
8 notes 2 In spite of their nominal equality Marcus held more auctoritas or authority than Verus. He had been consul once more than Lucius he had shared in Pius administration and he alone was Pontifex maximus. It would have been clear to the public which emperor was the more senior.8 As the biographer wrote Verus obeyed Marcus...as a lieutenant obeys a proconsul or a governor obeys the emperor.10 Immediately after their senate confirmation the emperors proceeded to the Castra Praetoria the camp of the praetorian guard. Lucius addressed the assembled troops which then acclaimed the pair as imperatores. Then like every new emperor since Claudius Lucius promised the troops a special donative.11 This donative however was twice the size of those past 20000 sesterces 5000 denarii per capita and more to officers. In return for this bounty equivalent to several years pay the troops swore an oath to protect the emperors.12 The ceremony was perhaps not entirely necessary given that Marcus accession had been peaceful and unopposed but it was good insurance against later military troubles.13 Piuss funeral ceremonies were in the words of the biographer elaborate.14 If his funeral followed the pattern of past funerals his body would have been incinerated on a pyre at the Campus Martius while his spirit would rise to the gods home in the heavens. Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification. In contrast to their behavior during Piuss campaign to deify Hadrian the senate did not oppose the emperors wishes.15 A flamen or cultic priest was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Pius now Divus Antoninus. Piuss remains were laid to rest in Hadrians mausoleum beside the remains of Marcuss children and of Hadrian himself.15 The temple he had dedicated to his wife Diva Faustina became the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina. It survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda.13 Early rule 1611
62 edit Ancient Roman bust of Lucius Verus as a young man in the Collection of Greek and Roman Antiquities in the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna Soon after the emperors accession Marcuss elevenyearold daughter Annia Lucilla was betrothed to Lucius in spite of the fact that he was formally her uncle.16 At the ceremonies commemorating the event new provisions were made for the support of poor children along the lines of earlier imperial foundations.17 Marcus and Lucius proved popular with the people of Rome who strongly approved of their civiliter lacking pomp behavior.18 The emperors permitted free speech evidenced by the fact that the comedy writer Marullus was able to criticize them without suffering retribution. At any other time under any other emperor he would have been executed. But it was a peaceful time a forgiving time. And thus as the biographer wrote No one missed the lenient ways of Pius.18 Fronto returned to his Roman townhouse at dawn on 28 March having left his home in Cirta as soon as news of his pupils accession reached him. He sent a note to the imperial freedman Charilas asking if he could call on the emperors. Fronto would later explain that he had not dared to write the emperors directly.19 The tutor was immensely proud of his students. Reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143 when he had praised the young Marcus Fronto was ebullient There was then an outstanding natural ability in you there is now perfected excellence. There was then a crop of growing corn there is now a ripe gathered harvest. What I was hoping for then I have now. The hope has become a reality.20 Fronto called on Marcus alone neither thought to invite Lucius.21 Lucius was less esteemed by his tutor than his brother as his interests were on a lower level. Lucius asked Fronto to adjudicate in a dispute he and his friend Calpurnius were having on the relative merits of two actors.22 Marcus told Fronto of his readingCoelius and a little Ciceroand his family. His daughters were in Rome with their greatgreataunt Matidia Minor Marcus thought the evening air of the country was too cold for them.23 The emperors early reign proceeded smoothly. Marcus was able to give himself wholly to philosophy and the pursuit of popular affection.24 Some minor troubles cropped up in the spring there would be more later. In the spring of 1
62 notes 3 the Tiber flooded over its banks destroying much of Rome. It drowned many animals leaving the city in famine. Marcus and Lucius gave the crisis their personal attention.
26 notes 4 In other times of famine the emperors are said to have provided for the Italian communities out of the Roman granaries.28 War with Parthia 1611

62 edit On his deathbed Pius spoke of nothing but the state and the foreign kings who had wronged him.29 One of those kings Vologases IV of Parthia made his move in late summer or early autumn 1
61.3 0 Vologases entered the Kingdom of Armenia then a Roman client state expelled its king and installed his ownPacorus an Arsacid like himself.31 At the time of the invasion the Governor of Syria was Lucius Attidius Cornelianus. Attidius had been retained as governor even though his term ended in 161 presumably to avoid giving the Parthians the chance to wrongfoot his replacement. The Governor of Cappadocia the frontline in all Armenian conflicts was Marcus Sedatius Severianus a Gaul with much experience in military matters. But living in the east had a deleterious effect on his character.32 Severianus had fallen under the influence of Alexander of Abonoteichus a selfproclaimed prophet who carried a snake named Glycon around with him but was really only a confidence man.33 Alexander was fatherinlaw to the respected senator Publius Mummius Sisenna Rutilianus thenproconsul of Asia and friends with many members of the east Roman elite.34 Alexander convinced Severianus that he could defeat the Parthians easily and win glory for himself.35 Severianus led a legion perhaps the IX Hispana36 into Armenia but was trapped by the great Parthian general Chosrhoes at Elegeia a town just beyond the Cappadocian frontiers high up past the headwaters of the Euphrates. Severianus made some attempt to fight Chosrhoes but soon realized the futility of his campaign and committed suicide. His legion was massacred. The campaign had only lasted three days.37 There was threat of war on other frontiers as wellin Britain and in Raetia and Upper Germany where the Chatti of the Taunus mountains had recently crossed over the limes.38 Marcus was unprepared. Pius seems to have given him no military experience the biographer writes that Marcus spent the whole of Piuss twentythreeyear reign at his emperors sideand not in the provinces where most previous emperors had spent their early careers.
39 notes 5 Marcus made the necessary appointments Marcus Statius Priscus the Governor of Britain was sent to replace Severianus as Governor of Cappadocia.41 Sextus Calpurnius Agricola took Priscuss former office.42 It was a Strategic emergency.edit Colossal head of Lucius Verus mounted on a modern bust from a villa belonging to him in Acqua Traversa near Rome between 180 and 183 AD Louvre Museum Paris More news arrived Attidius Cornelianuss army had been defeated in battle against the Parthians and retreated in disarray.43 Reinforcements were dispatched for the Parthian frontier. Publius Julius Geminius Marcianus an African senator commanding X Gemina at Vindobona Vienna left for Cappadocia with detachments from the Danubian legions.44 Three full legions were also sent east I Minervia from Bonn in Upper Germany45 II Adiutrix from Aquincum46 and V Macedonica from Troesmis.47 The northern frontiers were strategically weakened frontier governors were told to avoid conflict wherever possible.48 Attidius Cornelianus himself was replaced by Marcus Annius Libo Marcuss first cousin. He was younghis first consulship was in 161 so he was probably in his early thirties
49 and as a mere patrician lacked military experience. Marcus had chosen a reliable man rather than a talented one.50 Marcus took a fourday public holiday at Alsium a resort town on the Etrurian coast. He was too anxious to relax. Writing to Fronto he declared that he would not speak about his holiday.51 Fronto replied ironically What Do I not know that you went to Alsium with the intention of devoting yourself to games joking and complete leisure for four whole days52 He encouraged Marcus to rest calling on the example of his predecessors Pius had enjoyed exercise in the palaestra fishing and comedy53 going so far as to write up a fable about the gods division of the day between morning and eveningMarcus had apparently been spending most of his evenings on judicial matters instead of at leisure.54 Marcus could not take Frontos advice. I have duties hanging over me that can hardly be begged off he wrote back.55 Marcus put on Frontos voice to chastise himself Much good has my advice done you you will say. He had rested and would rest often but this devotion to duty. Who knows better than you how demanding it is56 Fronto sent Marcus a selection of reading material including Ciceros pro lege Manilia in which the orator had argued in favor of Pompey taking supreme command in the Mithridatic War. It was an apt reference Pompeys war had taken him to Armenia and may have had some impact on the decision to send Lucius to the eastern front.57 You will find in it many chapters aptly suited to your present counsels concerning the choice of army commanders the interests of allies the protection of provinces the discipline of the soldiers the qualifications required for commanders in the field and elsewhere ...notes 659 To settle his unease over the course of the Parthian War Fronto wrote Marcus a long and considered letter full of historical references. In modern editions of Frontos works it is labeled De bello Parthico On the Parthian War. There had been reverses in Romes past Fronto writes at Allia at Caudium at Cannae at Numantia Cirta and Carrhae60 under Trajan Hadrian and Pius61 but in the end Romans had always prevailed over their enemies always and everywhere Mars has changed our troubles into successes and our terrors into triumphs.62 Luciuss dispatch and journey east 1621
63 edit Busts of the coemperors Marcus Aurelius left and Lucius Verus right British Museum Over the winter of 16162 as more troubling news arriveda rebellion was brewing in Syriait was decided that Lucius should direct the Parthian War in person. He was stronger and healthier than Marcus the argument went more suited to military activity.63 Luciuss biographer suggests ulterior motives to restrain Luciuss debaucheries to make him thrifty to reform his morals by the terror of war to realize that he was an emperor.
64 notes 7 Whatever the case the senate gave its assent and Lucius left. Marcus remained in Rome the city demanded the presence of an emperor.66 Furius Victorinus one of the two praetorian prefects was sent with Lucius as were a pair of senators M. Pontius Laelianus Larcius Sabinus and M. Iallius Bassus and part of the praetorian guard.65 Victorinus had previously served as procurator of Galatia giving him some experience with eastern affairs.
67 notes 8 Moreover he was far more qualified than his praetorian partner Cornelius Repentinus who was said to owe his office to the influence of Piuss mistress Galeria Lysistrate.68 Repentinus had the rank of a senator but no real access to senatorial circleshis was merely a decorative title.69 Since a prefect had to accompany the guard Victorinus was the clear choice.68 Laelianus had been governor of both Pannonias and Governor of Syria in 153 thus he had firsthand knowledge of the eastern army and military strategy on the frontiers. He was made comes Augustorum companion of the emperors for his service.70 Laelianus was in the words of Fronto a serious man and an oldfashioned disciplinarian.71 Bassus had been Governor of Lower Moesia and was also made comes.72 Lucius selected his favorite freedmen including Geminus Agaclytus Coedes Eclectus73 and Nicomedes who gave up his duties as praefectus vehiculorum to run the commissariat of the expeditionary force.67 The fleet of Misenum was charged with transporting the Emperor and general communications and transport.74 Lucius left in the summer of 162 to take a ship from Brundisium Marcus followed him as far as Capua. Lucius feasted himself in the country houses along his route and hunted at Apulia. He fell ill at Canosa probably afflicted with a mild stroke and took to bed.75 Marcus made prayers to the gods for his safety in front of the senate and hurried south to see him.76 Fronto was upset at the news but was reassured when Lucius sent him a letter describing his treatment and recovery. In his reply Fronto urged his pupil to moderate his desires and recommended a few days of quiet bedrest. Lucius was better after three days fasting and a bloodletting.77 Verus continued eastward via Corinth and Athens accompanied by musicians and singers as if in a royal progress.78 At Athens he stayed with Herodes Atticus and joined the Eleusinian Mysteries.79 During sacrifice a falling star was observed in the sky shooting west to east.80 He stopped in Ephesus where he is attested at the estate of the local aristocrat Publius Vedius Antoninus81 and made an unexpected stopover at Erythrae.82 The journey continued by ship through the Aegean and the southern coasts of Asia Minor lingering in the famed pleasure resorts of Pamphylia and Cilicia before arriving in Antioch.83 It is not known how long Veruss journey east took he might not have arrived in Antioch until after 1
62.8 4 Statius Priscus meanwhile must have already arrived in Cappadocia he would earn fame in 163 for successful generalship.85 Luxury and logistics at Antioch 1621
65 edit Antioch from the southwest engraving by William Miller after a drawing by H. Warren from a sketch by Captain Byam Martin R.N. 1866 Statue of Lucius Verus on a body modelled after a sculpture by the ancient Athenian sculptor Myron Vatican Museums Lucius spent most of the campaign in Antioch though he wintered at Laodicea and summered at Daphne a resort just outside Antioch.86 He took up a mistress named Pantheanotes 9 from Smyrna.88 The biographer calls her a lowborn girlfriend89 but she was described as a woman of perfect beauty by Lucius. One biographer has postulated that Panthea may have been more beautiful than any of Phidias and Praxiteles statues.90 The mistress was musically inclined and spoke Ionic Greek spiced with Attic wit.91 Panthea read Lucians first draft and criticized him for flattery. He had compared her to a goddess which frightened hershe did not want to become the next Cassiopeia.92 She had power too. She made Lucius shave his beard for her. The Syrians mocked him for this as they did for much else.93 Critics declaimed Lucius luxurious lifestyle.94 He had taken to gambling they said he would dice the whole night through.95 He enjoyed the company of actors.96 He made a special request for dispatches from Rome to keep him updated on how his chariot teams were doing.97 He brought a golden statue of the Greens horse Volucer around with him as a token of his team spirit.98 Fronto defended his pupil against some of these claims the Roman people needed Lucius bread and circuses to keep them in check.
99 notes 10 This at least is how the biographer has it. The whole section of the vita dealing with Lucius debaucheries HA Verus 
4.4 
6.6  is an insertion into a narrative otherwise entirely cribbed from an earlier source. Some few passages seem genuinenotes 11 others take and elaborate something from the original.notes 12 The rest is by the biographer himself relying on nothing better than his own imagination.103 Lucius faced quite a task. Fronto described the scene in terms recalling Corbulos arrival one hundred years before.104 The Syrian army had turned soft during the easts long peace. They spent more time at the citys openair cafs than in their quarters. Under Lucius training was stepped up. Pontius Laelianus ordered that their saddles be stripped of their padding. Gambling and drinking were sternly policed.105 Fronto wrote that Lucius was on foot at the head of his army as often as on horseback. He personally inspected soldiers in the field and at camp including the sick bay.106 Lucius sent Fronto few messages at the beginning of the war. He sent Fronto a letter apologizing for his silence. He would not detail plans that could change within a day he wrote. Moreover there was little thus far to show for his work not even yet has anything been accomplished such as to make me wish to invite you to share in the joy.107 Lucius did not want Fronto to suffer the anxieties that had kept him up day and night.108 One reason for Lucius reticence may have been the collapse of Parthian negotiations after the Roman conquest of Armenia. Lucius presentation of terms was seen as cowardice.109 The Parthians were not in the mood for peace.110 Lucius needed to make extensive imports into Antioch so he opened a sailing route up the Orontes. Because the river breaks across a cliff before reaching the city Lucius ordered that a new canal be dug. After the project was completed the Orontes old riverbed dried up exposing massive bonesthe bones of a giant. Pausanias says they were from a beast more than eleven cubits tall Philostratus says that it was thirty cubits tall. The oracle at Claros declared that they were the bones of the rivers spirit.111 These bones would later be understood to be that of several large unspecified animals.112 Lucilla depicted as Ceres In the middle of the war perhaps in autumn 163 or early 164 Lucius made a trip to Ephesus to be married to Marcus daughter Lucilla.113 Lucillas thirteenth birthday was in March 163 whatever the date of her marriage she was not yet fifteen.114 Marcus had moved up the date perhaps stories of Panthea had disturbed him.115 Lucilla was accompanied by her mother Faustina and M. Vettulenus Civica Barbarus the halfbrother of Lucius father.116 Marcus may have planned to accompany them all the way to Smyrna the biographer says he told the senate he would this did not happen.117 Marcus only accompanied the group as far as Brundisium where they boarded a ship for the east.118 Marcus returned to Rome immediately thereafter and sent out special instructions to his proconsuls not to give the group any official reception.119 Lucilla would bear three of Lucius children in the coming years. Lucilla became Lucilla Augusta.120 Counterattack and victory 1631
66 edit I Minervia and V Macedonica under the legates M. Claudius Fronto and P. Martius Verus served under Statius Priscus in Armenia earning success for Roman arms during the campaign season of 163121 including the capture of the Armenian capital Artaxata.122 At the end of the year Verus took the title Armeniacus despite having never seen combat Marcus declined to accept the title until the following year.123 When Lucius was hailed as imperator again however Marcus did not hesitate to take the Imperator II with him.124 The army of Syria was reinforced by II Adiutrix and Danubian legions under X Geminas legate Geminius Marcianus.125 The Euphrates river near Raqqa Syria Occupied Armenia was reconstructed on Roman terms. In 164 a new capital Kaine Polis New City replaced Artaxata.126 On Birleys reckoning it was thirty miles closer to the Roman border.115 Detachments from Cappadocian legions are attested at Echmiadzin beneath the southern face of Mount Ararat 400 km east of Satala. It would have meant a march of twenty days or more through mountainous terrain from the Roman border a remarkable example of imperialism in the words of Fergus Millar.127 A new king was installed a Roman senator of consular rank and Arsacid descent Gaius Julius Sohaemus. He may not even have been crowned in Armenia the ceremony may have taken place in Antioch or even Ephesus.128 Sohaemus was hailed on the imperial coinage of 164 under the legend Rex armeniis Datus Verus sat on a throne with his staff while Sohaemus stood before him saluting the emperor.129 In 163 while Statius Priscus was occupied in Armenia the Parthians intervened in Osroene a Roman client in upper Mesopotamia just east of Syria with its capital at Edessa. They deposed the countrys leader Mannus and replaced him with their own nominee who would remain in office until 1
65.1 30 The Edessene coinage record actually begins at this point with issues showing Vologases IV on the obverse and Wael the king Syriac WL MLK on the reverse.131 In response Roman forces were moved downstream to cross the Euphrates at a more southerly point.110 On the evidence of Lucian the Parthians still held the southern Roman bank of the Euphrates in Syria as late as 163 he refers to a battle at Sura which is on the southern side of the river.132 Before the end of the year however Roman forces had moved north to occupy Dausara and Nicephorium on the northern Parthian bank.1
33 notes 13 Soon after the conquest of the north bank of the Euphrates other Roman forces moved on Osroene from Armenia taking Anthemusia a town southwest of Edessa.136 There was little movement in 164 most of the year was spent on preparations for a renewed assault on Parthian territory.115 Invasion of Mesopotamia 1
65 edit The apotheosis of Lucius Verus 
2 nd century relief plates from Ephesus on display at Humboldt University of Berlin Ancient bust of Lucius Verus in the Bardo National Museum Tunis 
2 nd century AD In 165 Roman forces perhaps led by Martius Verus and the V Macedonica moved on Mesopotamia. Edessa was reoccupied Mannus reinstalled.137 His coinage resumed too Manu the king Syriac MNW MLK or Antonine dynasts on the obverse and King Mannos friend of Romans Greek Basileus Mannos Philormaios on the reverse.131 The Parthians retreated to Nisibis but this too was besieged and captured. The Parthian army dispersed in the Tigris their general Chosrhoes swam down the river and made his hideout in a cave.138 A second force under Avidius Cassius and the III Gallica moved down the Euphrates and fought a major battle at Dura.139 By the end of the year Cassius army had reached the twin metropolises of Mesopotamia Seleucia on the right bank of the Tigris and Ctesiphon on the left. Ctesiphon was taken and its royal palace set to flame. The citizens of Seleucia still largely Greek the city had been commissioned and settled as a capital of the Seleucid Empire one of Alexander the Greats successor kingdoms opened its gates to the invaders. The city got sacked nonetheless leaving a black mark on Lucius reputation. Excuses were sought or invented the official version had it that the Seleucids broke faith first.140 Whatever the case the sacking marks a particularly destructive chapter in Seleucias long decline.141 Cassius army although suffering from a shortage of supplies and the effects of a plague contracted in Seleucia made it back to Roman territory safely.142 Iunius Maximus a young tribunus laticlavius serving in III Gallica under Cassius took the news of the victory to Rome. Maximus received a generous cash bounty dona for bringing the good news and immediate promotion to the quaestorship.143 Lucius took the title Parthicus Maximus and he and Marcus were hailed as imperatores again earning the title imp. III.144 Cassius army returned to the field in 166 crossing over the Tigris into Media. Lucius took the title Medicus145 and the emperors were again hailed as imperatores becoming imp. IV in imperial titulature. Marcus took the Parthicus Maximus now after another tactful delay.146 Most of the credit for the wars success must be ascribed to subordinate generals. The forces that advanced on Osroene were led by M. Claudius Fronto an Asian provincial of Greek descent who had led I Minervia in Armenia under Priscus. He was probably the first senator in his family.147 Fronto was consul for 165 probably in honor of the capture of Edessa.148 P. Martius Verus had led V Macedonica to the front and also served under Priscus. Martius Verus was a westerner whose patria was perhaps Tolosa in Gallia Narbonensis.149 The most prominent general however was C. Avidius Cassius commander of III Gallica one of the Syrian legions. Cassius was a young senator of low birth from the north Syrian town of Cyrrhus. His father Heliodorus had not been a senator but was nonetheless a man of some standing he had been Hadrians ab epistulis followed the emperor on his travels and was prefect of Egypt at the end of Hadrians reign. Cassius also with no small sense of selfworth claimed descent from the Seleucid kings.150 Cassius and Martius Verus still probably in their midthirties took the consulships for 1
66.1 51 Vologases IV of Parthia 147191 made peace but was forced to cede western Mesopotamia to the Romans. Years in Romeedit Portrait head of Lucius Verus found in Athens National Archaeological Museum of Athens. He used to sprinkle golddust on his blond hair to make it brighter.152 The next two years 166168 were spent in Rome. Verus continued with his glamorous lifestyle and kept the troupe of actors and favourites with him. He had a tavern built in his house where he celebrated parties with his friends until dawn. He also enjoyed roaming around the city among the population without acknowledging his identity. The games of the circus were another passion in his life especially chariot racing. Marcus Aurelius disapproved of his conduct but since Verus continued to perform his official tasks with efficiency there was little that he could do.citation needed Wars on the Danube and deathedit Further information Marcomannic Wars In the spring of 168 war broke out in the Danubian border when the Marcomanni invaded the Roman territory. This war would last until 180 but Verus did not see the end of it. In 168 as Verus and Marcus Aurelius returned to Rome from the field Verus fell ill with symptoms attributed to food poisoning dying after a few days 169. However scholars believe that Verus may have been a victim of smallpox as he died during a widespread epidemic known as the Antonine Plague.citation needed Despite the minor differences between them Marcus Aurelius grieved the loss of his adoptive brother. He accompanied the body to Rome where he offered games to honour his memory. After the funeral the senate declared Verus divine to be worshipped as Divus Verus.

See alsoedit Augustan History Notesedit  These nameswaps have proven so confusing that even the Historia Augusta the main source for the period cannot keep them straight.8 The fourthcentury ecclesiastical historian Eusebius of Caesarea shows even more confusion.9 The mistaken belief that Lucius had the name Verus before becoming emperor has proven especially popular.8  There was however much precedent. The consulate was a twin magistracy and earlier emperors had often had a subordinate lieutenant with many imperial offices under Pius the lieutenant had been Marcus. Many emperors had planned a joint succession in the pastAugustus planned to leave Gaius Caesar and Lucius Caesar as joint emperors on his death Tiberius wished to have Gaius Caligula and Tiberius Gemellus do so as well Claudius left the empire to Nero and Britannicus imagining that they would accept equal rankbut all of these arrangements had ended in failure either through premature death Gaius and Lucius Caesar or judicial murder Gemellus by Caligula and Britannicus by Nero.8  Because both Verus and Marcus are said to have taken active part in the recovery HA Marcus 
8.4 5 the flood must have happened before Veruss departure for the east in 162 because it appears in the biographers narrative after Pius funeral has finished and the emperors have settled into their offices it must not have occurred in the spring of 161. A date in autumn 161 or spring 162 is probable and given the normal seasonal distribution of Tiber flooding the most probable date is in spring 1
62.2 5 Birley dates the flood to autumn 1
61.2 1  Since 15 CE the river had been administered by a Tiber conservancy board with a consular senator at its head and a permanent staff. In 161 the curator alevi Tiberis et riparum et cloacarum urbis curator of the Tiber bed and banks and the city sewers was A. Platorius Nepos son or grandson of the builder of Hadrians Wall whose name he shares. He probably had not been particularly incompetent. A more likely candidate for that incompetence is Nepos likely predecessor M. Statius Priscus. A military man and consul for 159 Priscus probably looked on the office as little more than paid leave.27  Alan Cameron adduces the fifthcentury writer Sidonius Apollinariss comment that Marcus commanded countless legions vivente Pio while Pius was alive while contesting Birleys contention that Marcus had no military experience. Neither Apollinaris nor the Historia Augusta Birleys source are particularly reliable on secondcentury history.40  The text breaks off here.58  Birley believes there is some truth in these considerations.65  Victorinus had also served in Britain on the Danube in Spain as prefect of the Italian fleets as prefect of Egypt and in many posts in Rome itself.67  Or Pantheia.87  Fronto called it the corndole and public spectacles annona et spectaculis preferring his own pompous rephrase to Juvenals plain panem et circenses.100 Fronto was in any case unfamiliar with Juvenal the author was out of style through the classicizing mania of the Second Sophistic and would not become popular until the later fourth century.101  In the judgment of T.D. Barnes

6.2 6 And finally even at Rome when he was present and seated with Marcus he suffered many insults from the Blues because he had outrageously as they maintained taken sides against them. For he had a golden statue made of the Green horse Volucer and this he always carried around with him indeed he was wont to put raisins and nuts instead of barley in this horses manger and to order him brought to him in the House of Tiberius covered with a blanket dyed with purple and he built him a tomb when he died on the Vatican Hill. It was because of this horse that gold pieces and prizes first began to be demanded for horses and in such honour was this horse held that frequently a whole peck of gold pieces was demanded for him by the faction of the Greens. 
10.8  He was somewhat halting in speech a reckless gambler ever of an extravagant mode of life and in many respects save only that he was not cruel or given to acting a second Nero. for the comparison with other bad emperors at
