It is best known as when the Hyksos whose reign comprised the Fifteenth Dynasty made their appearance in Egypt. The Thirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the      and was unable to hold onto the two lands of Egypt. Either at the start of the dynasty c. 1805 BC or toward the middle of it in c. 1710 BC the provincial ruling family in Xois located in the marshes of the eastern Delta broke away from the central authority to form the Canaanite     . The Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of Sobekhotep IV and around 1720 BC took control of the town of  the modern Tell elDabaKhatana conquering the kingdom of the 
14 th dynasty. Sometime around 1650 BC the Hyksos perhaps led by Salitis the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty conquered   thereby terminating the 
13 th dynasty. The power vacuum in Upper Egypt resulting from the collapse of the 
13 th dynasty allowed the 
16 th dynasty to declare its independence in   only to be overrun by the Hyksos kings shortly thereafter. Subsequently as the Hyksos withdrew from Upper Egypt the native Egyptian ruling house in Thebes set itself up as the Seventeenth Dynasty. This dynasty eventually drove the Hyksos back into Asia under Seqenenre Tao Kamose and finally Ahmose first pharaoh of the New Kingdom.               The Thirteenth Dynasty following the Turin King List ruled from 1802 to around 1649 BC and lasted 153 or 154 years according to Manetho. This table should be contrasted with Known kings of the
