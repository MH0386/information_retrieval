Home to the ancient Macedonians the earliest kingdom was centered on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula8 and bordered by Epirus to the southwest Illyria to the northwest Paeonia to the north Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south. Before the 
4 th century BC Macedonia was a small kingdom outside of the area dominated by the great citystates of Athens Sparta and Thebes and briefly subordinate to Achaemenid Persia.3 During the reign of the Argead king Philip II 359336 BC Macedonia subdued mainland Greece and the Thracian Odrysian kingdom through conquest and diplomacy. With a reformed army containing phalanxes wielding the sarissa pike Philip II defeated the old powers of Athens and Thebes in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. Philip IIs son Alexander the Great leading a federation of Greek states accomplished his fathers objective of commanding the whole of Greece when he destroyed Thebes after the city revolted. During Alexanders subsequent campaign of conquest he overthrew the Achaemenid Empire and conquered territory that stretched as far as the Indus River. For a brief period his Macedonian Empire was the most powerful in the world  the definitive Hellenistic state inaugurating the transition to a new period of Ancient Greek civilization. Greek arts and literature flourished in the new conquered lands and advances in philosophy engineering and science spread across the empire and beyond. Of particular importance were the contributions of Aristotle tutor to Alexander whose writings became a keystone of Western philosophy. After Alexanders death in 323 BC the ensuing wars of the Diadochi and the partitioning of Alexanders shortlived empire Macedonia remained a Greek cultural and political center in the Mediterranean region along with Ptolemaic Egypt the Seleucid Empire and the Attalid kingdom. Important cities such as Pella Pydna and Amphipolis were involved in power struggles for control of the territory. New cities were founded such as Thessalonica by the usurper Cassander named after his wife Thessalonike of Macedon.9 Macedonias decline began with the Macedonian Wars and the rise of Rome as the leading Mediterranean power. At the end of the Third Macedonian War in 168 BC the Macedonian monarchy was abolished and replaced by Roman client states. A shortlived revival of the monarchy during the Fourth Macedonian War in 150148 BC ended with the establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia. The Macedonian kings who wielded absolute power and commanded state resources such as gold and silver facilitated mining operations to mint currency finance their armies and by the reign of Philip II a Macedonian navy. Unlike the other diadochi successor states the imperial cult fostered by Alexander was never adopted in Macedonia yet Macedonian rulers nevertheless assumed roles as high priests of the kingdom and leading patrons of domestic and international cults of the Hellenistic religion. The authority of Macedonian kings was theoretically limited by the institution of the army while a few municipalities within the Macedonian commonwealth enjoyed a high degree of autonomy and even had democratic governments with popular assemblies. Etymology See also Makedon mythology and Macedonia terminology The name Macedonia Greek  Makedona comes from the ethnonym  Makednes which itself is derived from the ancient Greek adjective  makedns meaning tall slim also the name of a people related to the Dorians Herodotus and possibly descriptive of Ancient Macedonians.10 It is most likely cognate with the adjective  makros meaning long or tall in Ancient Greek.10 The name is believed to have originally meant either highlanders the tall ones or high grown men.note 1 Linguist Robert S. P. Beekes claims that both terms are of PreGreek substrate origin and cannot be explained in terms of IndoEuropean morphology11 however Filip De Decker rejects Beekes arguments as insufficient.12 History Main article History of Macedonia ancient kingdom Early history and legend Main articles Achaemenid Macedonia and Argead dynasty Further information List of ancient Macedonians  Kings The entrance to one of the royal tombs at Vergina a UNESCO World Heritage Site The Classical Greek historians Herodotus and Thucydides reported the legend that the Macedonian kings of the Argead dynasty were descendants of Temenus king of Argos and could therefore claim the mythical Heracles as one of their ancestors as well as a direct lineage from Zeus chief god of the Greek pantheon.13 Contradictory legends state that either Perdiccas I of Macedon or Caranus of Macedon were the founders of the Argead dynasty with either five or eight kings before Amyntas I.14 The assertion that the Argeads descended from Temenus was accepted by the Hellanodikai authorities of the Ancient Olympic Games permitting Alexander I of Macedon r.498454 BC to enter the competitions owing to his perceived Greek heritage.15 Little is known about the kingdom before the reign of Alexander Is father Amyntas I of Macedon r.547498 BC during the Archaic period.16 The kingdom of Macedonia was situated along the Haliacmon and Axius rivers in Lower Macedonia north of Mount Olympus. Historian Robert Malcolm Errington suggests that one of the earliest Argead kings established Aigai modern Vergina as their capital in the mid
7 th century BC.17 Before the 
4 th century BC the kingdom covered a region corresponding roughly to the western and central parts of the region of Macedonia in modern Greece.18 It gradually expanded into the region of Upper Macedonia inhabited by the Greek Lyncestae and Elimiotae tribes and into regions of Emathia Eordaia Bottiaea Mygdonia Crestonia and Almopia which were inhabited by various peoples such as Thracians and Phrygians.note 2 Macedonias nonGreek neighbors included Thracians inhabiting territories to the northeast Illyrians to the northwest and Paeonians to the north while the lands of Thessaly to the south and Epirus to the west were inhabited by Greeks with similar cultures to that of the Macedonians.19 A silver octadrachm of Alexander I of Macedon r.498454 BC minted c.465460 BC showing an equestrian figure wearing a chlamys short cloak and petasos head cap while holding two spears and leading a horse The Ionians with shieldhats Old Persian cuneiform  Yaun takabar20 depicted on the tomb of Xerxes I at Naqshe Rustam were probably Macedonian soldiers in the service of the Achaemenid army wearing the petasos or kausia c.480 BC.21 A year after Darius I of Persia r.522486 BC launched an invasion into Europe against the Scythians Paeonians Thracians and several Greek citystates of the Balkans the Persian general Megabazus used diplomacy to convince Amyntas I to submit as a vassal of the Achaemenid Empire ushering in the period of Achaemenid Macedonia.note 3 Achaemenid Persian hegemony over Macedonia was briefly interrupted by the Ionian Revolt 499493 BC yet the Persian general Mardonius brought it back under Achaemenid suzerainty.22 Although Macedonia enjoyed a large degree of autonomy and was never made a satrapy i.e. province of the Achaemenid Empire it was expected to provide troops for the Achaemenid army.23 Alexander I provided Macedonian military support to Xerxes I r.486465 BC during the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 480479 BC and Macedonian soldiers fought on the side of the Persians at the 479 BC Battle of Platea.24 Following the Greek victory at Salamis in 480 BC Alexander I was employed as an Achaemenid diplomat to propose a peace treaty and alliance with Athens an offer that was rejected.25 Soon afterwards the Achaemenid forces were forced to withdraw from mainland Europe marking the end of Persian control over Macedonia.26 Involvement

Sparta and Peloponnesian League red independent states blue and the Persian Achaemenid Empire purple Although initially a Persian vassal Alexander I of Macedon fostered friendly diplomatic relations with his former Greek enemies the Athenian and Spartanled coalition of Greek citystates.27 His successor Perdiccas II r.454413 BC led the Macedonians to war in four separate conflicts against Athens leader of the Delian League while incursions by the Thracian ruler Sitalces of the Odrysian kingdom threatened Macedonias territorial integrity in the northeast.28 The Athenian statesman Pericles promoted colonization of the Strymon River near the Kingdom of Macedonia where the colonial city of Amphipolis was founded in 437436 BC so that it could provide Athens with a steady supply of silver and gold as well as timber and pitch to support the Athenian navy.29 Initially Perdiccas II did not take any action and might have even welcomed the Athenians as the Thracians were foes to both of them.30 This changed due to an Athenian alliance with a brother and cousin of Perdiccas II who had rebelled against him.30 Thus two separate wars were fought against Athens between 433 and 431 BC.30 The Macedonian king retaliated by promoting the rebellion of Athens allies in Chalcidice and subsequently won over the strategic city of Potidaea.31 After capturing the Macedonian cities Therma and Beroea Athens besieged Potidaea but failed to overcome it Therma was returned to Macedonia and much of Chalcidice to Athens in a peace treaty brokered by Sitalces who provided Athens with military aid in exchange for acquiring new Thracian allies.32 Perdiccas II sided with Sparta in the Peloponnesian War 431404 BC between Athens and Sparta and in 429 BC Athens retaliated by persuading Sitalces to invade Macedonia but he was forced to retreat owing to a shortage of provisions in winter.33 In 424 BC Arrhabaeus a local ruler of Lynkestis in Upper Macedonia rebelled against his overlord Perdiccas and the Spartans agreed to help in putting down the revolt.34 At the Battle of Lyncestis the Macedonians panicked and fled before the fighting began enraging the Spartan general Brasidas whose soldiers looted the unattended Macedonian baggage train.35 Perdiccas then changed sides and supported Athens and he was able to put down Arrhabaeuss revolt.36 A Macedonian didrachm minted during the reign of Archelaus I of Macedon r.413399 BC Brasidas died in 422 BC the year Athens and Sparta struck an accord the Peace of Nicias that freed Macedonia from its obligations as an Athenian ally.37 Following the 418 BC Battle of Mantinea the victorious Spartans formed an alliance with Argos a military pact Perdiccas II was keen to join given the threat of Spartan allies remaining in Chalcidice.38 When Argos suddenly switched sides as a proAthenian democracy the Athenian navy was able to form a blockade against Macedonian seaports and invade Chalcidice in 417 BC.39 Perdiccas II sued for peace in 414 BC forming an alliance with Athens that was continued by his son and successor Archelaus I r.413399 BC.40 Athens then provided naval support to Archelaus I in the 410 BC Macedonian siege of Pydna in exchange for timber and naval equipment.41 Although Archelaus I was faced with some internal revolts and had to fend off an invasion of Illyrians led by Sirras of Lynkestis he was able to project Macedonian power into Thessaly where he sent military aid to his allies.42 Although he retained Aigai as a ceremonial and religious center Archelaus I moved the capital of the kingdom north to Pella which was then positioned by a lake with a river connecting it to the Aegean Sea.43 He improved Macedonias currency by minting coins with a higher silver content as well as issuing separate copper coinage.44 His royal court attracted the presence of wellknown intellectuals such as the Athenian playwright Euripides.45 When Archelaus I was assassinated perhaps following a homosexual love affair with royal pages at his court the kingdom was plunged into chaos in an era lasting from 399 to 393 BC that included the reign of four different monarchs Orestes son of Archelaus I Aeropus II uncle regent and murderer of Orestes Pausanias son of Aeropus II and Amyntas II who was married to the youngest daughter of Archelaus I.46 Very little is known about this turbulent period it came to an end when Amyntas III r.393370 BC son of Arrhidaeus and grandson of Amyntas I killed Pausanias and claimed the Macedonian throne.47 A silver stater of Amyntas III of Macedon r.393370 BC Amyntas III was forced to flee his kingdom in either 393 or 383 BC based on conflicting accounts owing to a massive invasion by the Illyrians led by Bardylis.note 4 The pretender to the throne Argaeus ruled in his absence yet Amyntas III eventually returned to his kingdom with the aid of Thessalian allies.48 Amyntas III was also nearly overthrown by the forces of the Chalcidian city of Olynthos but with the aid of Teleutias brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their Chalcidian League in 379 BC.49 Alexander II r.370368 BC son of Eurydice I and Amyntas III succeeded his father and immediately invaded Thessaly to wage war against the tagus supreme Thessalian military leader Alexander of Pherae capturing the city of Larissa.50 The Thessalians desiring to remove both Alexander II and Alexander of Pherae as their overlords appealed to Pelopidas of Thebes for aid he succeeded in recapturing Larissa and in the peace agreement arranged with Macedonia received aristocratic hostages including Alexander IIs brother and future king Philip II r.359336 BC.51 When Alexander was assassinated by his brotherinlaw Ptolemy of Aloros the latter acted as an overbearing regent for Perdiccas III r.368359 BC younger brother of Alexander II who eventually had Ptolemy executed when reaching the age of majority in 365 BC.52 The remainder of Perdiccas IIIs reign was marked by political stability and financial recovery.53 However an Athenian invasion led by Timotheus son of Conon managed to capture Methone and Pydna and an Illyrian invasion led by Bardylis succeeded in killing Perdiccas III and 4000 Macedonian troops in battle.54 Rise of Macedon Main article Expansion of Macedonia under Philip

Map of the Kingdom of Macedon at the death of Philip II in 336 BC light blue with the original territory that existed in 431 BC red outline and dependent states yellow Philip II was twentyfour years old when he acceded to the throne in 359 BC.55 Through the use of deft diplomacy he was able to convince the Thracians under Berisades to cease their support of Pausanias a pretender to the throne and the Athenians to halt their support of another pretender.56 He achieved these by bribing the Thracians and their Paeonian allies and establishing a treaty with Athens that relinquished his claims to Amphipolis.57 He was also able to make peace with the Illyrians who had threatened his borders.58 Philip II spent his initial years radically transforming the Macedonian army. A reform of its organization equipment and training including the introduction of the Macedonian phalanx armed with long pikes i.e. the sarissa proved immediately successful when tested against his Illyrian and Paeonian enemies.59 Confusing accounts in ancient sources have led modern scholars to debate how much Philip IIs royal predecessors may have contributed to these reforms and the extent to which his ideas were influenced by his adolescent years of captivity in Thebes as a political hostage during the Theban hegemony especially after meeting with the general Epaminondas.60 The Macedonians like the other Greeks traditionally practiced monogamy but Philip II practiced polygamy and married seven wives with perhaps only one that did not involve the loyalty of his aristocratic subjects or new allies.note 5 His first marriages were to Phila of Elimeia of the Upper Macedonian aristocracy as well as the Illyrian princess Audata to ensure a marriage alliance.61 To establish an alliance with Larissa in Thessaly he married the Thessalian noblewoman Philinna in 358 BC who bore him a son who would later rule as Philip III Arrhidaeus r.323317 BC.62 In 357 BC he married Olympias to secure an alliance with Arybbas the King of Epirus and the Molossians. This marriage would bear a son who would later rule as Alexander III better known as Alexander the Great and claim descent from the legendary Achilles by way of his dynastic heritage from Epirus.63 It is unclear whether or not the Achaemenid Persian kings influenced Philip IIs practice of polygamy although his predecessor Amyntas III had three sons with a possible second wife Gygaea Archelaus Arrhidaeus and Menelaus.64 Philip II had Archelaus put to death in 359 BC while Philip IIs other two half brothers fled to Olynthos serving as a casus belli for the Olynthian War 349348 BC against the Chalcidian League.65 While Athens was preoccupied with the Social War 357355 BC Philip II retook Amphipolis from them in 357 BC and the following year recaptured Pydna and Potidaea the latter of which he handed over to the Chalcidian League as promised in a treaty.66 In 356 BC he took Crenides refounding it as Philippi while his general Parmenion defeated the Illyrian king Grabos II of the Grabaei.67 During the 355354 BC siege of Methone Philip II lost his right eye to an arrow wound but managed to capture the city and treated the inhabitants cordially unlike the Potidaeans who had been enslaved.note 6 Philip II then involved Macedonia in the Third Sacred War 356346 BC. It began when Phocis captured and plundered the temple of Apollo at Delphi instead of submitting unpaid fines causing the Amphictyonic League to declare war on Phocis and a civil war among the members of the Thessalian League aligned with either Phocis or Thebes.68 Philip IIs initial campaign against Pherae in Thessaly in 353 BC at the behest of Larissa ended in two disastrous defeats by the Phocian general Onomarchus.note 7 Philip II in turn defeated Onomarchus in 352 BC at the Battle of Crocus Field which led to Philip IIs election as leader archon of the Thessalian League provided him a seat on the Amphictyonic Council and allowed for a marriage alliance with Pherae by wedding Nicesipolis niece of the tyrant Jason of Pherae.69 Philip II had some early involvement with the Achaemenid Empire especially by supporting satraps and mercenaries who rebelled against the central authority of the Achaemenid king. The satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia Artabazos II who was in rebellion against Artaxerxes III was able to take refuge as an exile at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC. He was accompanied in exile by his family and by his mercenary general Memnon of Rhodes.7071 Barsine daughter of Artabazos and future wife of Alexander the Great grew up at the Macedonian court.71 After campaigning against the Thracian ruler Cersobleptes in 349 BC Philip II began his war against the Chalcidian League which had been reestablished in 375 BC following a temporary disbandment.72 Despite an Athenian intervention by Charidemus73 Olynthos was captured by Philip II in 348 BC and its inhabitants were sold into slavery including some Athenian citizens.74 The Athenians especially in a series of speeches by Demosthenes known as the Olynthiacs were unsuccessful in persuading their allies to counterattack and in 346 BC concluded a treaty with Macedonia known as the Peace of Philocrates.75 The treaty stipulated that Athens would relinquish claims to Macedonian coastal territories the Chalcidice and Amphipolis in return for the release of the enslaved Athenians as well as guarantees that Philip II would not attack Athenian settlements in the Thracian Chersonese.76 Meanwhile Phocis and Thermopylae were captured by Macedonian forces the Delphic temple robbers were executed and Philip II was awarded the two Phocian seats on the Amphictyonic Council and the position of master of ceremonies over the Pythian Games.77 Athens initially opposed his membership on the council and refused to attend the games in protest but they eventually accepted these conditions perhaps after some persuasion by Demosthenes in his oration On the Peace.78 Left a Niketerion victory medallion bearing the effigy of king Philip II of Macedon

Right the ruins of the Philippeion at Olympia Greece which was built by Philip II of Macedon to celebrate his victory at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC.79 Over the next few years Philip II reformed local governments in Thessaly campaigned against the Illyrian ruler Pleuratus I deposed Arybbas in Epirus in favor of his brotherinlaw Alexander I through Philip IIs marriage to Olympias and defeated Cersebleptes in Thrace. This allowed him to extend Macedonian control over the Hellespont in anticipation of an invasion into Achaemenid Anatolia.80 In 342 BC Philip II conquered a Thracian city in what is now Bulgaria and renamed it Philippopolis modern Plovdiv.81 War broke out with Athens in 340 BC while Philip II was engaged in two ultimately unsuccessful sieges of Perinthus and Byzantion followed by a successful campaign against the Scythians along the Danube and Macedonias involvement in the Fourth Sacred War against Amphissa in 339 BC.82 Thebes ejected a Macedonian garrison from Nicaea near Thermopylae leading Thebes to join Athens Megara Corinth Achaea and Euboea in a final confrontation against Macedonia at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC.83 After the Macedonian victory at Chaeronea Philip II installed an oligarchy in Thebes yet was lenient toward Athens wishing to utilize their navy in a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire.84 He was then chiefly responsible for the formation of the League of Corinth that included the major Greek citystates except Sparta. Despite the Kingdom of Macedonias official exclusion from the league in 337 BC Philip II was elected as the leader hegemon of its council synedrion and the commanderinchief strategos autokrator of a forthcoming campaign to invade the Achaemenid Empire.85 Philips plan to punish the Persians for the suffering of the Greeks and to liberate the Greek cities of Asia Minor86 as well as perhaps the panhellenic fear of another Persian invasion of Greece contributed to his decision to invade the Achaemenid Empire.87 The Persians offered aid to Perinthus and Byzantion in 341340 BC highlighting Macedonias strategic need to secure Thrace and the Aegean Sea against increasing Achaemenid encroachment as the Persian king Artaxerxes III further consolidated his control over satrapies in western Anatolia.88 The latter region yielding far more wealth and valuable resources than the Balkans was also coveted by the Macedonian king for its sheer economic potential.89 When Philip II married Cleopatra Eurydice niece of general Attalus talk of providing new potential heirs at the wedding feast infuriated Philip IIs son Alexander a veteran of the Battle of Chaeronea and his mother Olympias.90 They fled together to Epirus before Alexander was recalled to Pella by Philip II.90 When Philip II arranged a marriage between his son Arrhidaeus and Ada of Caria daughter of Pixodarus the Persian satrap of Caria Alexander intervened and proposed to marry Ada instead. Philip II then cancelled the wedding altogether and exiled Alexanders advisors Ptolemy Nearchus and Harpalus.91 To reconcile with Olympias Philip II had their daughter Cleopatra marry Olympias brother and Cleopatras uncle Alexander I of Epirus but Philip II was assassinated by his bodyguard Pausanias of Orestis during their wedding feast and succeeded by Alexander in 336 BC.92 Empire Further information Wars of Alexander the Great Wars of the Diadochi and Chronology of the expedition of Alexander the Great into Asia Left Bust of Alexander the Great by the Athenian sculptor Leochares 330 BC Acropolis Museum Athens.

Alexanders empire and his route Modern scholars have argued over the possible role of Alexander III the Great and his mother Olympias in the assassination of Philip II noting the latters choice to exclude Alexander from his planned invasion of Asia choosing instead for him to act as regent of Greece and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth and the potential bearing of another male heir between Philip II and his new wife Cleopatra Eurydice.note 8 Alexander III r.336323 BC was immediately proclaimed king by an assembly of the army and leading aristocrats chief among them being Antipater and Parmenion.93 By the end of his reign and military career in 323 BC Alexander would rule over an empire consisting of mainland Greece Asia Minor the Levant ancient Egypt Mesopotamia Persia and much of Central and South Asia i.e. modern Pakistan.94 Among his first acts was the burial of his father at Aigai.95 The members of the League of Corinth revolted at the news of Philip IIs death but were soon quelled by military force alongside persuasive diplomacy electing Alexander as hegemon of the league to carry out the planned invasion of Achaemenid Persia.96 In 335 BC Alexander fought against the Thracian tribe of the Triballi at Haemus Mons and along the Danube forcing their surrender on Peuce Island.97 Shortly thereafter the Illyrian chieftain Cleitus son of Bardylis threatened to attack Macedonia with the aid of Glaucias king of the Taulantii but Alexander took the initiative and besieged the Illyrians at Pelion in modern Albania.98 When Thebes had once again revolted from the League of Corinth and was besieging the Macedonian garrison in the Cadmea Alexander left the Illyrian front and marched to Thebes which he placed under siege.99 After breaching the walls Alexanders forces killed 6000 Thebans took 30000 inhabitants as prisoners of war and burned the city to the ground as a warning that convinced all other Greek states except Sparta not to challenge Alexander again.100 Throughout his military career Alexander won every battle that he personally commanded.101 His first victory against the Persians in Asia Minor at the Battle of the Granicus in 334 BC used a small cavalry contingent as a distraction to allow his infantry to cross the river followed by a cavalry charge from his companion cavalry.102 Alexander led the cavalry charge at the Battle of Issus in 333 BC forcing the Persian king Darius III and his army to flee.102 Darius III despite having superior numbers was again forced to flee the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC.102 The Persian king was later captured and executed by his own satrap of Bactria and kinsman Bessus in 330 BC. The Macedonian king subsequently hunted down and executed Bessus in what is now Afghanistan securing the region of Sogdia in the process.103 At the 326 BC Battle of the Hydaspes modernday Punjab when the war elephants of King Porus of the Pauravas threatened Alexanders troops he had them form open ranks to surround the elephants and dislodge their handlers by using their sarissa pikes.104 When his Macedonian troops threatened mutiny in 324 BC at Opis Babylonia near modern Baghdad Iraq Alexander offered Macedonian military titles and greater responsibilities to Persian officers and units instead forcing his troops to seek forgiveness at a staged banquet of reconciliation between Persians and Macedonians.105 The Stag Hunt Mosaic c. 300 BC from Pella the figure on the right is possibly Alexander the Great due to the date of the mosaic along with the depicted upsweep of his centrallyparted hair anastole the figure on the left wielding a doubleedged axe associated with Hephaistos is perhaps Hephaestion one of Alexanders loyal companions. Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of megalomania.106 While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert in modernday Egypt in 331 BC.107 His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual.106 When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana near modern Hamadan Iran in 330 BC this was symptomatic of the growing gulf between the kings interests and those of his country and people according to Errington.108 His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as vengeful and reckless by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington.109 Continuing the polygamous habits of his father Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia leading by example when he wed Roxana a Sogdian princess of Bactria.110 He then married Stateira II eldest daughter of Darius III and Parysatis II youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.111 Meanwhile in Greece the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia.112 He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexanders stead.note 9 Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese Memnon the governor of Thrace was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy.113 Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages.114 Antipaters hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice perhaps by order of Alexander of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian troops yet in 330 BC Alexander declared that the tyrannies installed in Greece were to be abolished and Greek freedom was to be restored.115 Kingdoms of the Diadochi c. 301 BC after the Battle of Ipsus Kingdom of Ptolemy I Soter Kingdom of Cassander Kingdom of Lysimachus Kingdom of Seleucus I Nicator Epirus Other Carthage Roman Republic Greek States A golden stater of Philip III Arrhidaeus r.323317 BC bearing images of Athena left and Nike right When Alexander the Great died at Babylon in 323 BC his mother Olympias immediately accused Antipater and his faction of poisoning him although there is no evidence to confirm this.116 With no official heir apparent the Macedonian military command split with one side proclaiming Alexanders halfbrother Philip III Arrhidaeus r.323317 BC as king and the other siding with the infant son of Alexander and Roxana Alexander IV r.323309 BC.117 Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War 323322 BC.118 When Antipater was defeated at the 323 BC Battle of Thermopylae he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. A Macedonian army led by Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege.119 Antipater defeated the rebellion yet his death in 319 BC left a power vacuum wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the diadochi the former generals of Alexanders army.120 A council of the army convened in Babylon immediately after Alexanders death naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent.121 Antipater Antigonus Monophthalmus Craterus and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas in a civil war initiated by Ptolemys seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great.122 Perdiccas was assassinated in 321 BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2000 of his men.123 Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights.124 Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319 BC he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor passing over his own son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent since Philip III was considered mentally unstable in effect bypassing the council of the army as well.125 Forming an alliance with Ptolemy Antigonus and Lysimachus Cassander had his officer Nicanor capture the Munichia fortress of Athens port town Piraeus in defiance of Polyperchons decree that Greek cities should be free of Macedonian garrisons sparking the Second War of the Diadochi 319315 BC.126 Given a string of military failures by Polyperchon in 317 BC Philip III by way of his politically engaged wife Eurydice II of Macedon officially replaced him as regent with Cassander.127 Afterwards Polyperchon desperately sought the aid of Olympias in Epirus.127 A joint force of Epirotes Aetolians and Polyperchons troops invaded Macedonia and forced the surrender of Philip III and Eurydices army allowing Olympias to execute the king and force his queen to commit suicide.128 Olympias then had Nicanor and dozens of other Macedonian nobles killed but by the spring of 316 BC Cassander had defeated her forces captured her and placed her on trial for murder before sentencing her to death.129 Cassander married Philip IIs daughter Thessalonike and briefly extended Macedonian control into Illyria as far as Epidamnos modern Durrs Albania. By 313 BC it was retaken by the Illyrian king Glaucias of Taulantii.130 By 316 BC Antigonus had taken the territory of Eumenes and managed to eject Seleucus Nicator from his Babylonian satrapy leading Cassander Ptolemy and Lysimachus to issue a joint ultimatum to Antigonus in 315 BC for him to surrender various territories in Asia.9 Antigonus promptly allied with Polyperchon now based in Corinth and issued an ultimatum of his own to Cassander charging him with murder for executing Olympias and demanding that he hand over the royal family King Alexander IV and the queen mother Roxana.131 The conflict that followed lasted until the winter of 312311 BC when a new peace settlement recognized Cassander as general of Europe Antigonus as first in Asia Ptolemy as general of Egypt and Lysimachus as general of Thrace.132 Cassander had Alexander IV and Roxana put to death in the winter of 311310 BC and between 306 and 305 BC the diadochi were declared kings of their respective territories.133 Hellenistic era Further information Antipatrid dynasty Antigonid dynasty Hellenistic period Pyrrhic War Chremonidean War and Cleomenean War The portrait busts of Pyrrhus of Epirus top left Demetrius I of Macedon top right Seleucus I Nicator bottom left and Lysimachus bottom right Romanera copies of Hellenistic Greek originals from the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum Naples National Archaeological Museum The beginning of Hellenistic Greece was defined by the struggle between the Antipatrid dynasty led first by Cassander r.305297 BC son of Antipater and the Antigonid dynasty led by the Macedonian general Antigonus I Monophthalmus r.306301 BC and his son the future king Demetrius I r.294288 BC. Cassander besieged Athens in 303 BC but was forced to retreat to Macedonia when Demetrius invaded Boeotia to his rear attempting to sever his path of retreat.134 While Antigonus and Demetrius attempted to recreate Philip IIs Hellenic league with themselves as dual hegemons a revived coalition of Cassander Ptolemy I Soter r.305283 BC of Egypts Ptolemaic dynasty Seleucus I Nicator r.305281 BC of the Seleucid Empire and Lysimachus r.306281 BC King of Thrace defeated the Antigonids at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC killing Antigonus and forcing Demetrius into flight.135 Cassander died in 297 BC and his sickly son Philip IV died the same year succeeded by Cassanders other sons Alexander V of Macedon r.297294 BC and Antipater II of Macedon r.297294 BC with their mother Thessalonike of Macedon acting as regent.136 While Demetrius fought against the Antipatrid forces in Greece Antipater II killed his own mother to obtain power.136 His desperate brother Alexander V then requested aid from Pyrrhus of Epirus r.297272 BC136 who had fought alongside Demetrius at the Battle of Ipsus but was sent to Egypt as a hostage as part of an agreement between Demetrius and Ptolemy I.137 In exchange for defeating the forces of Antipater II and forcing him to flee to the court of Lysimachus in Thrace Pyrrhus was awarded the westernmost portions of the Macedonian kingdom.138 Demetrius had his nephew Alexander V assassinated and was then proclaimed king of Macedonia but his subjects protested against his aloof Easternstyle autocracy.136 War broke out between Pyrrhus and Demetrius in 290 BC when Lanassa wife of Pyrrhus daughter of Agathocles of Syracuse left him for Demetrius and offered him her dowry of Corcyra.139 The war dragged on until 288 BC when Demetrius lost the support of the Macedonians and fled the country. Macedonia was then divided between Pyrrhus and Lysimachus the former taking western Macedonia and the latter eastern Macedonia.139 By 286 BC Lysimachus had expelled Pyrrhus and his forces from Macedonia.note 10 In 282 BC a new war erupted between Seleucus I and Lysimachus the latter was killed in the Battle of Corupedion allowing Seleucus I to take control of Thrace and Macedonia.140 In two dramatic reversals of fortune Seleucus I was assassinated in 281 BC by his officer Ptolemy Keraunos son of Ptolemy I and grandson of Antipater who was then proclaimed king of Macedonia before being killed in battle in 279 BC by Celtic invaders in the Gallic invasion of Greece.141 The Macedonian army proclaimed the general Sosthenes of Macedon as king although he apparently refused the title.142 After defeating the Gallic ruler Bolgios and driving out the raiding party of Brennus Sosthenes died and left a chaotic situation in Macedonia.143 The Gallic invaders ravaged Macedonia until Antigonus Gonatas son of Demetrius defeated them in Thrace at the 277 BC Battle of Lysimachia and was then proclaimed king Antigonus II of Macedon r.277274 272239 BC.144 In 280 BC Pyrrhus embarked on a campaign in Magna Graecia i.e. southern Italy against the Roman Republic known as the Pyrrhic War followed by his invasion of Sicily.145 Ptolemy Keraunos secured his position on the Macedonian throne by giving Pyrrhus five thousand soldiers and twenty war elephants for this endeavor.137 Pyrrhus returned to Epirus in 275 BC after the ultimate failure of both campaigns which contributed to the rise of Rome because Greek cities in southern Italy such as Tarentum now became Roman allies.145 Pyrrhus invaded Macedonia in 274 BC defeating the largely mercenary army of Antigonus II at the 274 BC Battle of Aous and driving him out of Macedonia forcing him to seek refuge with his naval fleet in the Aegean.146 Paintings of Hellenisticera military arms and armor from a tomb in ancient Mieza modernday Lefkadia Imathia Central Macedonia Greece 
2 nd century BC Pyrrhus lost much of his support among the Macedonians in 273 BC when his unruly Gallic mercenaries plundered the royal cemetery of Aigai.147 Pyrrhus pursued Antigonus II in the Peloponnese yet Antigonus II was ultimately able to recapture Macedonia.148 Pyrrhus was killed while besieging Argos in 272 BC allowing Antigonus II to reclaim the rest of Greece.149 He then restored the Argead dynastic graves at Aigai and annexed the Kingdom of Paeonia.150 The Aetolian League hampered Antigonus IIs control over central Greece and the formation of the Achaean League in 251 BC pushed Macedonian forces out of much of the Peloponnese and at times incorporated Athens and Sparta.151 While the Seleucid Empire aligned with Antigonid Macedonia against Ptolemaic Egypt during the Syrian Wars the Ptolemaic navy heavily disrupted Antigonus IIs efforts to control mainland Greece.152 With the aid of the Ptolemaic navy the Athenian statesman Chremonides led a revolt against Macedonian authority known as the Chremonidean War 267261 BC.153 By 265 BC Athens was surrounded and besieged by Antigonus IIs forces and a Ptolemaic fleet was defeated in the Battle of Cos. Athens finally surrendered in 261 BC.154 After Macedonia formed an alliance with the Seleucid ruler Antiochus II a peace settlement between Antigonus II and Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt was finally struck in 255 BC.155 The Temple of Apollo at Corinth built c. 540 BC with the Acrocorinth i.e. the acropolis of Corinth that once held a Macedonian garrison156 seen in the background In 251 BC Aratus of Sicyon led a rebellion against Antigonus II and in 250 BC Ptolemy II declared his support for the selfproclaimed King Alexander of Corinth.157 Although Alexander died in 246 BC and Antigonus was able to score a naval victory against the Ptolemies at Andros the Macedonians lost the Acrocorinth to the forces of Aratus in 243 BC followed by the induction of Corinth into the Achaean League.158 Antigonus II made peace with the Achaean League in 240 BC ceding the territories that he had lost in Greece.159 Antigonus II died in 239 BC and was succeeded by his son Demetrius II of Macedon r.239229 BC. Seeking an alliance with Macedonia to defend against the Aetolians the queen mother and regent of Epirus Olympias II offered her daughter Phthia of Macedon to Demetrius II in marriage. Demetrius II accepted her proposal but he damaged relations with the Seleucids by divorcing Stratonice of Macedon.160 Although the Aetolians formed an alliance with the Achaean League as a result Demetrius II was able to invade Boeotia and capture it from the Aetolians by 236 BC.156 The Achaean League managed to capture Megalopolis in 235 BC and by the end of Demetrius IIs reign most of the Peloponnese except Argos was taken from the Macedonians.161 Demetrius II also lost an ally in Epirus when the monarchy was toppled in a republican revolution.162 Demetrius II enlisted the aid of the Illyrian king Agron to defend Acarnania against Aetolia and in 229 BC they managed to defeat the combined navies of the Aetolian and Achaean Leagues at the Battle of Paxos.162 Another Illyrian ruler Longarus of the Dardanian Kingdom invaded Macedonia and defeated an army of Demetrius II shortly before his death in 229 BC.163 Although his young son Philip immediately inherited the throne his regent Antigonus III Doson r.229221 BC nephew of Antigonus II was proclaimed king by the army with Philip as his heir following a string of military victories against the Illyrians in the north and the Aetolians in Thessaly.164 A tetradrachm minted during the reign of Antigonus III Doson r.229221 BC possibly at Amphipolis bearing the portrait image of Poseidon on the obverse and on the reverse a scene depicting Apollo sitting on the prow of a ship Aratus sent an embassy to Antigonus III in 226 BC seeking an unexpected alliance now that the reformist king Cleomenes III of Sparta was threatening the rest of Greece in the Cleomenean War 229222 BC.165 In exchange for military aid Antigonus III demanded the return of Corinth to Macedonian control which Aratus finally agreed to in 225 BC.166 In 224 BC Antigonus IIIs forces took Arcadia from Sparta. After forming a Hellenic league in the same vein as Philip IIs League of Corinth he managed to defeat Sparta at the Battle of Sellasia in 222 BC.167 Sparta was occupied by a foreign power for the first time in its history restoring Macedonias position as the leading power in Greece.168 Antigonus died a year later perhaps from tuberculosis leaving behind a strong Hellenistic kingdom for his successor Philip V.169 Philip V of Macedon r.221179 BC faced immediate challenges to his authority by the Illyrian Dardani and Aetolian League.170 Philip V and his allies were successful against the Aetolians and their allies in the Social War 220217 BC yet he made peace with the Aetolians once he heard of incursions by the Dardani in the north and the Carthaginian victory over the Romans at the Battle of Lake Trasimene in 217 BC.171 Demetrius of Pharos is alleged to have convinced Philip V to first secure Illyria in advance of an invasion of the Italian peninsula.note 11 In 216 BC Philip V sent a hundred light warships into the Adriatic Sea to attack Illyria a move that prompted Scerdilaidas of the Ardiaean Kingdom to appeal to the Romans for aid.172 Rome responded by sending ten heavy quinqueremes from Roman Sicily to patrol the Illyrian coasts causing Philip V to reverse course and order his fleet to retreat averting open conflict for the time being.173 Conflict with Rome Main article Macedonian Wars Further information Cretan War 205200 BC Punic Wars and MacedonianCarthaginian Treaty The Kingdom of Macedonia orange under Philip V r.221179 BC with Macedonian dependent states dark yellow the Seleucid Empire bright yellow Roman protectorates dark green the Kingdom of Pergamon light green independent states light purple and possessions of the Ptolemaic Empire violet purple In 215 BC at the height of the Second Punic War with the Carthaginian Empire Roman authorities intercepted a ship off the Calabrian coast holding a Macedonian envoy and a Carthaginian ambassador in possession of a treaty composed by Hannibal declaring an alliance with Philip V.174 The treaty stipulated that Carthage had the sole right to negotiate the terms of Romes hypothetical surrender and promised mutual aid if a resurgent Rome should seek revenge against either Macedonia or Carthage.175 Although the Macedonians were perhaps only interested in safeguarding their newly conquered territories in Illyria176 the Romans were nevertheless able to thwart whatever grand ambitions Philip V had for the Adriatic region during the First Macedonian War 214205 BC. In 214 BC Rome positioned a naval fleet at Oricus which was assaulted along with Apollonia by Macedonian forces.177 When the Macedonians captured Lissus in 212 BC the Roman Senate responded by inciting the Aetolian League Sparta Elis Messenia and Attalus I r.241197 BC of Pergamon to wage war against Philip V keeping him occupied and away from Italy.178 The Aetolian League concluded a peace agreement with Philip V in 206 BC and the Roman Republic negotiated the Treaty of Phoenice in 205 BC ending the war and allowing the Macedonians to retain some captured settlements in Illyria.179 Although the Romans rejected an Aetolian request in 202 BC for Rome to declare war on Macedonia once again the Roman Senate gave serious consideration to the similar offer made by Pergamon and its ally Rhodes in 201 BC.180 These states were concerned about Philip Vs alliance with Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid Empire which invaded the warweary and financially exhausted Ptolemaic Empire in the Fifth Syrian War 202195 BC as Philip V captured Ptolemaic settlements in the Aegean Sea.181 Although Romes envoys played a critical role in convincing Athens to join the antiMacedonian alliance with Pergamon and Rhodes in 200 BC the comitia centuriata peoples assembly rejected the Roman Senates proposal for a declaration of war on Macedonia.182 Meanwhile Philip V conquered territories in the Hellespont and Bosporus as well as Ptolemaic Samos which led Rhodes to form an alliance with Pergamon Byzantium Cyzicus and Chios against Macedonia.183 Despite Philip Vs nominal alliance with the Seleucid king he lost the naval Battle of Chios in 201 BC and was blockaded at Bargylia by the Rhodian and Pergamene navies.184 A tetradrachm of Philip V of Macedon r.221179 BC with the kings portrait on the obverse and Athena Alkidemos brandishing a thunderbolt on the reverse While Philip V was busy fighting Romes Greek allies Rome viewed this as an opportunity to punish this former ally of Hannibal with a war that they hoped would supply a victory and require few resources.note 12 The Roman Senate demanded that Philip V cease hostilities against neighboring Greek powers and defer to an international arbitration committee for settling grievances.185 When the comitia centuriata finally voted in approval of the Roman Senates declaration of war in 200 BC and handed their ultimatum to Philip V demanding that a tribunal assess the damages owed to Rhodes and Pergamon the Macedonian king rejected it. This marked the beginning of the Second Macedonian War 200197 BC with Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus spearheading military operations in Apollonia.186 Bronze bust of Eumenes II of Pergamon a Roman copy of a Hellenistic Greek original from the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum The Macedonians successfully defended their territory for roughly two years187 but the Roman consul Titus Quinctius Flamininus managed to expel Philip V from Macedonia in 198 BC forcing his men to take refuge in Thessaly.188 When the Achaean League switched their loyalties from Macedonia to Rome the Macedonian king sued for peace but the terms offered were considered too stringent and so the war continued.188 In June 197 BC the Macedonians were defeated at the Battle of Cynoscephalae.189 Rome then ratified a treaty that forced Macedonia to relinquish control of much of its Greek possessions outside of Macedonia proper if only to act as a buffer against Illyrian and Thracian incursions into Greece.190 Although some Greeks suspected Roman intentions of supplanting Macedonia as the new hegemonic power in Greece Flaminius announced at the Isthmian Games of 196 BC that Rome intended to preserve Greek liberty by leaving behind no garrisons and by not exacting tribute of any kind.191 His promise was delayed by negotiations with the Spartan king Nabis who had meanwhile captured Argos yet Roman forces evacuated Greece in 194 BC.192 Encouraged by the Aetolian League and their calls to liberate Greece from the Romans the Seleucid king Antiochus III landed with his army at Demetrias Thessaly in 192 BC and was elected strategos by the Aetolians.193 Macedonia the Achaean League and other Greek citystates maintained their alliance with Rome.194 The Romans defeated the Seleucids in the 191 BC Battle of Thermopylae as well as the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC forcing the Seleucids to pay a war indemnity dismantle most of its navy and abandon its claims to any territories north or west of the Taurus Mountains in the 188 BC Treaty of Apamea.195 With Romes acceptance Philip V was able to capture some cities in central Greece in 191189 BC that had been allied to Antiochus III while Rhodes and Eumenes II r.197159 BC of Pergamon gained territories in Asia Minor.196 Failing to please all sides in various territorial disputes the Roman Senate decided in 184183 BC to force Philip V to abandon Aenus and Maronea since these had been declared free cities in the Treaty of Apamea.note 13 This assuaged the fear of Eumenes II that Macedonia could pose a threat to his lands in the Hellespont.197 Perseus of Macedon r.179168 BC succeeded Philip V and executed his brother Demetrius who had been favored by the Romans but was charged by Perseus with high treason.198 Perseus then attempted to form marriage alliances with Prusias II of Bithynia and Seleucus IV Philopator of the Seleucid Empire along with renewed relations with Rhodes that greatly unsettled Eumenes II.199 Although Eumenes II attempted to undermine these diplomatic relationships Perseus fostered an alliance with the Boeotian League extended his authority into Illyria and Thrace and in 174 BC won the role of managing the Temple of Apollo at Delphi as a member of the Amphictyonic Council.200 Left a tetradrachm of Perseus of Macedon r.179168 BC British Museum.

Eumenes II came to Rome in 172 BC and delivered a speech to the Senate denouncing the alleged crimes and transgressions of Perseus.201 This convinced the Roman Senate to declare the Third Macedonian War 171168 BC.note 14 Although Perseuss forces were victorious against the Romans at the Battle of Callinicus in 171 BC the Macedonian army was defeated at the Battle of Pydna in June 168 BC.202 Perseus fled to Samothrace but surrendered shortly afterwards was brought to Rome for the triumph of Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus and was placed under house arrest at Alba Fucens where he died in 166 BC.203 The Romans abolished the Macedonian monarchy by installing four separate allied republics in its stead their capitals located at Amphipolis Thessalonica Pella and Pelagonia.204 The Romans imposed severe laws inhibiting many social and economic interactions between the inhabitants of these republics including the banning of marriages between them and the temporary prohibition on gold and silver mining.204 A certain Andriscus claiming Antigonid descent rebelled against the Romans and was pronounced king of Macedonia defeating the army of the Roman praetor Publius Juventius Thalna during the Fourth Macedonian War 150148 BC.205 Despite this Andriscus was defeated in 148 BC at the second Battle of Pydna by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus whose forces occupied the kingdom.206 This was followed in 146 BC by the Roman destruction of Carthage and victory over the Achaean League at the Battle of Corinth ushering in the era of Roman Greece and the gradual establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia.207 Institutions Main article Government of Macedonia ancient kingdom Division of power Further information Ancient Greek law The Vergina Sun the

The decision to send Alexander was based on his marriage alliance with a noble Persian house and his previous formal relationship with the citystate of Athens.213 With their ownership of natural resources including gold silver timber and royal land the early Macedonian kings were also capable of bribing foreign and domestic parties with impressive gifts.214 Little is known about the judicial system of ancient Macedonia except that the king acted as the chief judge of the kingdom.215 The Macedonian kings were also supreme commanders of the military.note 18 Philip II was also highly regarded for his acts of piety in serving as the high priest of the nation. He performed daily ritual sacrifices and led religious festivals.216 Alexander imitated various aspects of his fathers reign such as granting land and gifts to loyal aristocratic followers216 but lost some core support among them for adopting some of the trappings of an Eastern Persian monarch a lord and master as Carol J. King suggests instead of a comradeinarms as was the traditional relationship of Macedonian kings with their companions.217 Alexanders father Philip II was perhaps influenced by Persian traditions when he adopted institutions similar to those found in the Achaemenid realm such as having a royal secretary royal archive royal pages and a seated throne.218 Royal pages Left the god Dionysos riding a cheetah mosaic floor in the House of Dionysos at Pella Greece c. 330300 BC.

The royal pages were adolescent boys and young men conscripted from aristocratic households and serving the kings of Macedonia perhaps from the reign of Philip II onward although more solid evidence dates to the reign of Alexander the Great.note 19 Royal pages played no direct role in high politics and were conscripted as a means to introduce them to political life.219 After a period of training and service pages were expected to become members of the kings companions and personal retinue.220 During their training pages were expected to guard the king as he slept supply him with horses aid him in mounting his horse accompany him on royal hunts and serve him during symposia i.e. formal drinking parties.221 Although there is little evidence for royal pages in the Antigonid period it is known that some of them fled with Perseus of Macedon to Samothrace following his defeat by the Romans in 168 BC.222 Bodyguards Royal bodyguards served as the closest members to the king at court and on the battlefield.219 They were split into two categories the agema of the hypaspistai a type of ancient special forces usually numbering in the hundreds and a smaller group of men handpicked by the king either for their individual merits or to honor the noble families to which they belonged.219 Therefore the bodyguards limited in number and forming the kings inner circle were not always responsible for protecting the kings life on and off the battlefield their title and office was more a mark of distinction perhaps used to quell rivalries between aristocratic houses.219 Companions friends councils and assemblies Further information Synedrion Left an atrium with a pebblemosaic paving in Pella Greece.

The companions including the elite companion cavalry and pezhetairoi infantry represented a substantially larger group than the kings bodyguards.note 20 The most trusted or highest ranking companions formed a council that served as an advisory body to the king.223 A small amount of evidence suggests the existence of an assembly of the army during times of war and a peoples assembly during times of peace.note 21 Members of the council had the right to speak freely and although there is no direct evidence that they voted on affairs of state it is clear that the king was at least occasionally pressured to agree to their demands.224 The assembly was apparently given the right to judge cases of high treason and assign punishments for them such as when Alexander the Great acted as prosecutor in the trial and conviction of three alleged conspirators in his fathers assassination plot while many others were acquitted.225 However there is perhaps insufficient evidence to allow a conclusion that councils and assemblies were regularly upheld or constitutionally grounded or that their decisions were always heeded by the king.226 At the death of Alexander the Great the companions immediately formed a council to assume control of his empire but it was soon destabilized by open rivalry and conflict between its members.227 The army also used mutiny as a tool to achieve political ends.note 22 Magistrates the commonwealth local government and allied states Antigonid Macedonian kings relied on various regional officials to conduct affairs of state.228 This included highranking municipal officials such as the military strategos and the politarch i.e. the elected governor archon of a large city polis as well as the politicoreligious office of the epistates.note 23 No evidence exists about the personal backgrounds of these officials although they may have been chosen among the same group of aristocratic philoi and hetairoi who filled vacancies for army officers.215 Left a silver tetradrachm issued by the city of Amphipolis in 364363 BC before its conquest by Philip II of Macedon in 357 BC showing the head of Apollo on the obverse and racing torch on the reverse.

3 rd century BC indicates that foreign relations were handled by the central government. Although individual Macedonian cities nominally participated in Panhellenic events as independent entities in reality the granting of asylia inviolability diplomatic immunity and the right of asylum at sanctuaries to certain cities was handled directly by the king.234 Likewise the citystates within contemporary Greek koina i.e. federations of citystates the sympoliteia obeyed the federal decrees voted on collectively by the members of their league.note 25 In citystates belonging to a league or commonwealth the granting of proxenia i.e. the hosting of foreign ambassadors was usually a right shared by local and central authorities.235 Abundant evidence exists for the granting of proxenia as being the sole prerogative of central authorities in the neighboring Epirote League and some evidence suggests the same arrangement in the Macedonian commonwealth.236 Citystates that were allied with Macedonia issued their own decrees regarding proxenia.237 Foreign leagues also formed alliances with the Macedonian kings such as when the Cretan League signed treaties with Demetrius II Aetolicus and Antigonus III Doson ensuring enlistment of Cretan mercenaries into the Macedonian army and elected Philip V of Macedon as honorary protector prostates of the league.238 Military Main articles Ancient Macedonian army and Antigonid Macedonian army Further information Hellenistic armies and Macedonian phalanx Left a Macedonian infantryman possibly a hypaspist equipped with an aspis shield and wearing a linothorax cuirass and Thracian helmet bas relief from the Alexander Sarcophagus

Early Macedonian army Further information Government of Macedonia ancient kingdom The basic structure of the Ancient Macedonian army was the division between the companion cavalry hetairoi and the foot companions pezhetairoi augmented by various allied troops foreign levied soldiers and mercenaries.239 The foot companions existed perhaps since the reign of Alexander I of Macedon.240 Macedonian cavalry wearing muscled cuirasses became renowned in Greece during and after their involvement in the Peloponnesian War at times siding with either Athens or Sparta.241 Macedonian infantry in this period consisted of poorly trained shepherds and farmers while the cavalry was composed of noblemen.242 As evidenced by early 
4 th century BC artwork there was a pronounced Spartan influence on the Macedonian army before Philip II.243 Nicholas Viktor Sekunda states that at the beginning of Philip IIs reign in 359 BC the Macedonian army consisted of 10000 infantry and 600 cavalry244 yet Malcolm Errington cautions that these figures cited by ancient authors should be treated with some skepticism.245 Philip II and Alexander the Great Further information Military tactics in Ancient Greece and Thessalian cavalry After spending years as a political hostage in Thebes Philip II sought to imitate the Greek example of martial exercises and the issuing of standard equipment for citizen soldiery and succeeded in transforming the Macedonian army from a levied force of unprofessional farmers into a welltrained professional army.246 Philip II adopted some of the military tactics of his enemies such as the embolon flying wedge cavalry formation of the Scythians.247 His infantry wielded peltai shields that replaced the earlier aspisstyle shields were equipped with protective helmets greaves and either cuirasses breastplates or kotthybos stomach bands and armed with sarissa pikes and daggers as secondary weapons.note 26 The elite hypaspistai infantry composed of handpicked men from the ranks of the pezhetairoi were formed during the reign of Philip II and saw continued use during the reign of Alexander the Great.248 Philip II was also responsible for the establishment of the royal bodyguards somatophylakes.249 An ancient fresco of Macedonian soldiers from the tomb of Agios Athanasios Thessaloniki Greece

It is uncertain how many men were appointed as somatophylakes which numbered eight men at the end of Alexander the Greats reign while the hypaspistai seem to have morphed into assistants of the somatophylakes.note 29 At the Battle of Cynoscephalae in 197 BC the Macedonians commanded some 16000 phalanx pikemen.257 Alexander the Greats royal squadron of companion cavalry contained 800 men the same number of cavalrymen in the sacred squadron Latin sacra ala Greek hiera ile commanded by Philip V of Macedon during the Social War of 219 BC.258 The regular Macedonian cavalry numbered 3000 at Callinicus which was separate from the sacred squadron and royal cavalry.258 While Macedonian cavalry of the 
4 th century BC had fought without shields the use of shields by cavalry was adopted from the Celtic invaders of the 2
70 s BC who settled in Galatia central Anatolia.259 Thanks to contemporary inscriptions from Amphipolis and Greia dated 218 and 181 BC respectively historians have been able to partially piece together the organization of the Antigonid army under Philip V.note 30 From at least the time of Antigonus III Doson the most elite Antigonidperiod infantry were the peltasts lighter and more maneuverable soldiers wielding peltai javelins swords and a smaller bronze shield than Macedonian phalanx pikemen although they sometimes served in that capacity.note 31 Among the peltasts roughly 2000 men were selected to serve in the elite agema vanguard with other peltasts numbering roughly 30
00.2 60 The number of peltasts varied over time perhaps never more than 5000 men.note 32 They fought alongside the phalanx pikemen divided now into chalkaspides bronze shield and leukaspides white shield regiments.261 The Antigonid Macedonian kings continued to expand and equip the navy.262 Cassander maintained a small fleet at Pydna Demetrius I of Macedon had one at Pella and Antigonus II Gonatas while serving as a general for Demetrius in Greece used the navy to secure the Macedonian holdings in Demetrias Chalkis Piraeus and Corinth.263 The navy was considerably expanded during the Chremonidean War 267261 BC allowing the Macedonian navy to defeat the Ptolemaic Egyptian navy at the 255 BC Battle of Cos and 245 BC Battle of Andros and enabling Macedonian influence to spread over the Cyclades.263 Antigonus III Doson used the Macedonian navy to invade Caria while Philip V sent 200 ships to fight in the Battle of Chios in 201 BC.263 The Macedonian navy was reduced to a mere six vessels as agreed in the 197 BC peace treaty that concluded the Second Macedonian War with the Roman Republic although Perseus of Macedon quickly assembled some lemboi at the outbreak of the Third Macedonian War in 171 BC.263 Society and culture Main article Ancient Macedonians Further information Culture of ancient Greece Left a Macedonian funerary stele with an epigram in Greek mid

5 th century BC the Macedonians and the southern Greeks worshiped more or less the same deities of the Greek pantheon.268 In Macedonia political and religious offices were often intertwined. For instance the head of state for the city of Amphipolis also served as the priest of Asklepios Greek god of medicine a similar arrangement existed at Cassandreia where a cult priest honoring the citys founder Cassander was the nominal head of the city.269 The main sanctuary of Zeus was maintained at Dion while another at Veria was dedicated to Herakles and was patronized by Demetrius II Aetolicus r.239229 BC.270 Meanwhile foreign cults from Egypt were fostered by the royal court such as the temple of Sarapis at Thessaloniki.271 The Macedonians also had relations with international cults for example Macedonian kings Philip III of Macedon and Alexander IV of Macedon made votive offerings to the internationally esteemed Samothrace temple complex of the Cabeiri mystery cult.271 In the three royal tombs at Vergina professional painters decorated the walls with a mythological scene of Hades abducting Persephone and royal hunting scenes while lavish grave goods including weapons armor drinking vessels and personal items were housed with the dead whose bones were burned before burial in golden coffins.272 Some grave goods and decorations were common in other Macedonian tombs yet some items found at Vergina were distinctly tied to royalty including a diadem luxurious goods and arms and armor.273 Scholars have debated about the identity of the tomb occupants since the discovery of their remains in 19771978274 and recent research and forensic examination have concluded that at least one of the persons buried was Philip II.note 37 Located near Tomb 1 are the aboveground ruins of a heroon a shrine for cult worship of the dead.275 In 2014 the ancient Macedonian Kasta Tomb was discovered outside of Amphipolis and is the largest ancient tomb found in Greece as of 20

5 th century BC.279 The Macedonian king was an autocratic figure at the head of both government and society with arguably unlimited authority to handle affairs of state and public policy but he was also the leader of a very personal regime with close relationships or connections to his hetairoi the core of the Macedonian aristocracy.280 These aristocrats were second only to the king in terms of power and privilege filling the ranks of his administration and serving as commanding officers in the military.281 It was in the more bureaucratic regimes of the Hellenistic kingdoms that succeeded Alexander the Greats empire where greater social mobility for members of society seeking to join the aristocracy could be found especially in Ptolemaic Egypt.282 Although governed by a king and martial aristocracy Macedonia seems to have lacked the widespread use of slaves seen in contemporaneous Greek states.283 Visual arts Main article Ancient Greek art Further information Hellenistic art Music in ancient Greece Pottery of ancient Greece and Ancient Greek sculpture Left a fresco of a Macedonian soldier resting a spear and wearing a cap from the tomb of Agios Athanasios Thessaloniki

In addition to the agora the gymnasium the theatre and religious sanctuaries and temples dedicated to Greek gods and goddesses one of the main markers of a true Greek city in the empire of Alexander the Great was the presence of an odeon for musical performances.295 This was the case not only for Alexandria in Egypt but also for cities as distant as AiKhanoum in what is now modernday Afghanistan.295 Literature education philosophy and patronage Further information Literature in ancient Greece Education in ancient Greece Philosophy in ancient Greece Hellenistic philosophy Ancient Greek medicine and Ancient Macedonian calendar Portrait bust of Aristotle an Imperial Roman

3 rd century BC which perhaps influenced the later trencher bread of medieval Europe.307 Cattle and goats were consumed although there was no notice of Macedonian mountain cheeses in literature until the Middle Ages.307 The comedic playwright Menander wrote that Macedonian dining habits penetrated Athenian high society for instance the introduction of meats into the dessert course of a meal.308 The Macedonians also most likely introduced mattye to Athenian cuisine a dish usually made of chicken or other spiced salted and sauced meats served during the wine course.309 This particular dish was derided and connected with licentiousness and drunkenness in a play by the Athenian comic poet Alexis about the declining morals of Athenians in the age of Demetrius I of Macedon.310 The symposium in the Macedonian and wider Greek realm was a banquet for the nobility and privileged class an occasion for feasting drinking entertainment and sometimes philosophical discussion.311 The hetairoi leading members of the Macedonian aristocracy were expected to attend such feasts with their king.281 They were also expected to accompany him on royal hunts for the acquisition of game meat as well as for sport.281 Ethnic identity Main article Ancient Macedonians  Identity See also Macedonia terminology Makedon mythology Ethnography and Cultural anthropology Athenian terracotta figurine c. 300 BC.

The predominant viewpoint supports that the Macedonians were truly Greeks who had just retained a more archaic lifestyle than those living in southern parts of Greece.313 Ernst Badian notes however that nearly all surviving references to antagonisms and differences between Greeks and Macedonians exist in the written speeches of Arrian who lived at the time of the Roman Empire when any notion of an ethnic disparity between Macedonians and other Greeks was incomprehensible.314 Hatzopoulos argues that there was no real ethnic difference between Macedonians and the other Greeks only a political distinction contrived after the creation of the League of Corinth in 337 BC which was led by Macedonia through the leagues elected hegemon Philip II when he was not a member of the league itselfnote 43 N. G. L. Hammond asserts that ancient views differentiating Macedonias ethnic identity from the rest of the Greekspeaking world should be seen as an expression of conflict between two different political systems the democratic system of the citystates e.g. Athens versus the monarchy Macedonia.315 Other academics who concur that the difference between the Macedonians and Greeks was a political rather than a true ethnic discrepancy include Michael B. Sakellariou316 Malcolm Erringtonnote 44 and Craige B. Champion.note 45 Anson argues that some Hellenic authors expressed complex or even everchanging and ambiguous ideas about the exact ethnic identity of the Macedonians who were considered by some as barbarians and others as semiGreek or fully Greek.note 46 Roger D. Woodard asserts that in addition to persisting uncertainty in modern times about the proper classification of the Macedonian language and its relation to Greek ancient authors also presented conflicting ideas about the Macedonians.note 47 Simon Hornblower argues on the Greek identity of the Macedonians taking into consideration their origin language cults and customs related to ancient Greek traditions.317 Any preconceived ethnic differences between Greeks and Macedonians faded by 148 BC soon after the Roman conquest of Macedonia and then the rest of Greece with the defeat of the Achaean League by the Roman Republic at the Battle of Corinth 146 BC.318 Technology and engineering Further information Ancient Greek technology History of science in classical antiquity Ancient Greek astronomy Greek mathematics and Medicine in ancient Greece Architecture Further information Architecture of ancient Greece The facade of the Macedonian Tomb of the Palmettes in Mieza Macedonia Greece

Macedonian architecture although utilizing a mixture of different forms and styles from the rest of Greece did not represent a unique or diverging style from other ancient Greek architecture.290 Among the classical orders Macedonian architects favored the Ionic order especially in the peristyle courtyards of private homes.320 There are several surviving examples albeit in ruins of Macedonian palatial architecture including a palace at the site of the capital Pella the summer residence of Vergina near the old capital Aigai and the royal residence at Demetrias near modern Volos.320 At Vergina the ruins of three large banquet halls with marbletiled floors covered in the debris of roof tiles with floor plan dimensions measuring roughly

For instance following his victory at the Battle of Chaeronea 338 BC Philip II raised a round memorial building at Olympia known as the Philippeion decorated inside with statues depicting him his parents Amyntas III of Macedon and Eurydice I of Macedon his wife Olympias and his son Alexander the Great.323 Ruins of the ancient theatre in Maroneia Rhodope East Macedonia and Thrace Greece The ruins of roughly twenty Greek theatres survive in the presentday regions of Macedonia and Thrace in Greece sixteen openair theatres three odea and a possible theatre in Veria undergoing excavation.324 Military technology and engineering Further information Greek and Roman artillery Ancient Greek warfare Lithobolos and Siege ladder By the Hellenistic period it became common for Greek states to finance the development and proliferation of ever more powerful torsion siege engines naval ships and standardized designs for arms and armor.325 Under Philip II and Alexander the Great improvements were made to siege artillery such as boltshooting ballistae and siege engines such as huge rolling siege towers.326 E. W. Marsden and M. Y. Treister contend that the Macedonian rulers Antigonus I Monophthalmus and his successor Demetrius I of Macedon had the most powerful siege artillery of the Hellenistic world at the end of the 
4 th century BC.327 The siege of Salamis Cyprus in 306 BC necessitated the building of large siege engines and drafting of craftsmen from parts of West Asia.328 The siege tower commissioned by Demetrius I for the Macedonian Siege of Rhodes 305304 BC and defended by over three thousand soldiers was built at a height of nine stories.329 It had a base of 4300 square feet 399 square metres eight wheels that were steered in either direction by pivots three sides covered in iron plates to protect them from fire and mechanically opened windows shielded with woolstuffed leather curtains to soften the blow of ballistae rounds of different sizes to accommodate the firing of missiles ranging from arrows to larger bolts.329 During the siege of Echinus by Philip V of Macedon in 211 BC the besiegers built tunnels to protect the soldiers and sappers as they went back and forth from the camp to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift wickerwork curtain wall mounted with stoneshooting ballistae and sheds to protect the approach of the battering ram.330 Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt became the center for technological improvements to the catapult by the 
3 rd century BC as evidenced by the writings of Philo of Alexandria.328 Other innovations Further information Ancient Macedonian calendar Although perhaps not as prolific as other areas of Greece in regards to technological innovations there are some inventions that may have originated in Macedonia aside from siege engines and artillery. The rotaryoperated olive press for producing olive oil may have been invented in ancient Macedonia or another part of Greece or even as far east as the Levant or Anatolia.331 Moldpressed glass first appeared in Macedonia in the 
4 th century BC although it could have simultaneously existed in the Achaemenid Empire the first known clear translucent glass pieces of the Greek world have been discovered in Macedonia and Rhodes and date to the second half of the 
4 th century BC.332 Greek technical and scientific literature began with Classical Athens in the 
5 th century BC while the major production centers for technical innovation and texts during the Hellenistic period were Alexandria Rhodes and Pergamon.333 Currency finances and resources Main article Government of Macedonia ancient kingdom Further information Ancient Greek coinage and Economy of ancient Greece Tetradrachms above and drachms below issued during the reign of Alexander the Great now in the Numismatic Museum of Athens The minting of silver coinage began during the reign of Alexander I as a means to pay for royal expenditures.215 Archelaus I increased the silver content of his coins as well as minting copper coins to promote foreign and domestic commerce.44 The minting of coinage significantly increased during the reigns of Philip II and Alexander the Great especially after the increase in state revenues following the seizure of the Pangaion Hills.334 During the Hellenistic period the royal houses of Macedonia Ptolemaic Egypt and the Attalid kingdom exercised full monopolistic control over mining activities largely to ensure the funding of their armies.335 By the end of the conquests of Alexander the Great nearly thirty mints stretching from Macedonia to Babylon produced standard coins.336 The right to mint coins was shared by central and some local governments i.e. the autonomous municipal governments of Thessaloniki Pella and Amphipolis within the Macedonian commonwealth.337 The Macedonians were also the first to issue different coins for internal and external circulation.338 State revenues were also raised by collecting produce from arable lands timber from forests and taxes on imports and exports at harbors.339 Some mines groves agricultural lands and forests belonging to the Macedonian state were exploited by the Macedonian king although these were often leased as assets or given as grants to members of the nobility such as the hetairoi and philoi.340 Tariffs exacted on goods flowing in and out of Macedonian seaports existed from at least the reign of Amyntas III and Callistratus of Aphidnae d. c. 350 BC aided Perdiccas III in doubling the kingdoms annual profits on customs duties from 20 to 40 talents.341 After the defeat of Perseus at Pydna in 168 BC the Roman Senate allowed the reopening of iron and copper mines but forbade the mining of gold and silver by the four newly established autonomous client states that replaced the monarchy in Macedonia.342 The law may originally have been conceived by the Senate due to the fear that material wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow the Macedonians to fund an armed rebellion.343 The Romans were perhaps also concerned with stemming inflation caused by an increased money supply from Macedonian silver mining.344 The Macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148 BC i.e. just before the establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia and when the Romans lifted the ban on Macedonian silver mining in 158 BC it may simply have reflected the local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of the Senates decree.345 Legacy Further information Hellenic studies Hellenistic religion Hellenistic Judaism and Hellenism neoclassicism The reigns of Philip II and Alexander the Great witnessed the demise of Classical Greece and the birth of Hellenistic civilization following the spread of Greek culture to the Near East during and after Alexanders conquests.346 Macedonians then migrated to Egypt and parts of Asia but the intensive colonization of foreign lands sapped the available manpower in Macedonia proper weakening the kingdom in its fight with other Hellenistic powers and contributing to its downfall and conquest by the Romans.347 However the diffusion of Greek culture and language cemented by Alexanders conquests in West Asia and North Africa served as a precondition for the later Roman expansion into these territories and entire basis for the Byzantine Empire according to Errington.348 The Alexander Mosaic a Roman mosaic from Pompeii Italy c.100 BC The ethnic Macedonian rulers of the Ptolemaic and Seleucid successor states accepted men from all over the Greek world as their hetairoi companions and did not foster a national identity like the Antigonids.349 Modern scholarship has focused on how these Hellenistic successor kingdoms were influenced more by their Macedonian origins than Eastern or southern Greek traditions.350 While Spartan society remained mostly insular and Athens continued placing strict limitations on acquiring citizenship the cosmopolitan Hellenistic cities of Asia and northeastern Africa bore a greater resemblance to Macedonian cities and contained a mixture of subjects including natives Greek and Macedonian colonists and Greekspeaking Hellenized Easterners many of whom were the product of intermarriage between Greeks and native populations.351 The deification of Macedonian monarchs perhaps began with the death of Philip II but it was his son Alexander the Great who unambiguously claimed to be a living god.note 48 Following his visit to the oracle of Didyma in 334 BC that suggested his divinity Alexander traveled to the Oracle of Zeus Ammonthe Greek equivalent of the Egyptian AmunRaat the Siwa Oasis of the Libyan Desert in 332 BC to confirm his divine status.note 49 Although the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires maintained ancestral cults and deified their rulers kings were not worshiped in the Kingdom of Macedonia.352 While Zeus Ammon was known to the Greeks prior to Alexanders reign particularly at the Greek colony of Cyrene Libya Alexander was the first Macedonian monarch to patronize Egyptian Persian and Babylonian priesthoods and deities strengthening the fusion of Near Eastern and Greek religious beliefs.353 After his reign the cult of Isis gradually spread throughout the Hellenistic and Roman world while beliefs in the Egyptian god Sarapis were thoroughly Hellenized by the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt before the spread of his cult to Macedonia and the Aegean region.354 The German historian Johann Gustav Droysen argued that the conquests of Alexander the Great and creation of the Hellenistic world allowed for the growth and establishment of Christianity in the Roman era.355 See also History portal Historiography of Alexander the Great List of kings of Macedon Geographic region

Olbrycht 2010 pp. 342343 Sprawski 2010 pp. 131 134 Errington 1990 pp. 89. Errington is skeptical that at this point Amyntas I of Macedon offered any submission as a vassal at all at most a token one. He also mentions how the Macedonian king pursued his own course of action such as inviting the exiled Athenian tyrant Hippias to take refuge at Anthemous in 506 BC.  Roisman 2010 pp. 158159 see also Errington 1990 p. 30 for further details the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus provided a seemingly conflicting account about Illyrian invasions occurring in 393 BC and 383 BC which may have been representative of a single invasion led by the Illyrian king Bardylis.  Mller 2010 pp. 169170 179. Mller is skeptical about the claims of Plutarch and Athenaeus that Philip II of Macedon married Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon a younger woman purely out of love or due to his own midlife crisis. Cleopatra was the daughter of the general Attalus who along with his fatherinlaw Parmenion were given command posts in Asia Minor modern Turkey soon after this wedding. Mller also suspects that this marriage was one of political convenience meant to ensure the loyalty of an influential Macedonian noble house.  Mller 2010 pp. 171172 Buckler 1989 pp. 63 176181 Cawkwell 1978 pp. 185187. Cawkwell contrarily provides the date of this siege as 354353 BC.

Conversely Buckler provides the date of this initial campaign as 354 BC while affirming that the second Thessalian campaign ending in the Battle of Crocus Field occurred in 353 BC.  Gilley  Worthington 2010 pp. 189190 Mller 2010 p. 183. Without implicating Alexander III of Macedon as a potential suspect in the plot to assassinate Philip II of Macedon N. G. L. Hammond and F. W. Walbank discuss possible Macedonian as well as foreign suspects such as Demosthenes and Darius III Hammond  Walbank 2001 pp. 812.  Gilley  Worthington 2010 pp. 199200 Errington 1990 pp. 44 93. Gilley and Worthington discuss the ambiguity surrounding the exact title of Antipater aside from deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth with some sources calling him a regent others a governor others a simple general. N. G. L. Hammond and F. W. Walbank state that Alexander the Great left Macedonia under the command of Antipater in case there was a rising in Greece. Hammond  Walbank 2001 p. 32.  Adams 2010 p. 219 Bringmann 2007 p. 61 Errington 1990 p. 155. Conversely Errington dates Lysimachus reunification of Macedonia by expelling Pyrrhus of Epirus as occurring in 284 BC not 286 BC.  Eckstein 2010 pp. 229230 see also Errington 1990 pp. 186189 for further details. Errington is skeptical that Philip V at this point had any intentions of invading southern Italy via Illyria once the latter was secured deeming his plans to be more modest Errington 1990 p. 189.  Bringmann 2007 pp. 8687. Errington 1990 pp. 202203 Roman desire for revenge and private hopes of famous victories were probably the decisive reasons for the outbreak of the war.  Bringmann 2007 pp. 9397 Eckstein 2010 p. 239 Errington 1990 pp. 207208. Bringmann dates this event of handing over Aenus and Maronea along the Thracian coast as 183 BC while Eckstein dates it as 184 BC.  Bringmann 2007 pp. 9899 see also Eckstein 2010 p. 242 who says that Rome ... as the sole remaining superpower ... would not accept Macedonia as a peer competitor or equal. Klaus Bringmann asserts that negotiations with Macedonia were completely ignored due to Romes political calculation that the Macedonian kingdom had to be destroyed to ensure the elimination of the supposed source of all the difficulties which Rome was having in the Greek world.  Written evidence about Macedonian governmental institutions made before Philip II of Macedons reign is both rare and nonMacedonian in origin. The main sources of early Macedonian historiography are the works of Herodotus Thucydides Diodorus Siculus and Justin. Contemporary accounts given by those such as Demosthenes were often hostile and unreliable even Aristotle who lived in Macedonia provides us with terse accounts of its governing institutions. Polybius was a contemporary historian who wrote about Macedonia later historians include Livy Quintus Curtius Rufus Plutarch and Arrian. The works of these historians affirm Macedonias hereditary monarchy and basic institutions yet it remains unclear if there was an established constitution for Macedonian government. See King 2010 pp. 373374. However N. G. L. Hammond and F. W. Walbank write with apparent certainty and conviction when describing the Macedonian constitutional government restricting the king and involving a popular assembly of the army. See Hammond  Walbank 2001 pp. 1213. The main textual primary sources for the organization of Macedonias military as it existed under Alexander the Great include Arrian Curtis Diodorus and Plutarch modern historians rely mostly on Polybius and Livy for understanding detailed aspects of the Antigonidperiod military. On this Sekunda 2010 pp. 446447 writes ... to this we can add the evidence provided by two magnificent archaeological monuments the Alexander Sarcophagus in particular and the Alexander Mosaic... In the case of the Antigonid army ... valuable additional details are occasionally supplied by Diodorus and Plutarch and by a series of inscriptions preserving sections of two sets of army regulations issued by Philip V.  King 2010 p. 374 for an argument about the absolutism of the Macedonian monarchy see Errington 1990 pp. 220222. However N. G. L. Hammond and F. W. Walbank write with apparent certainty and conviction when describing the Macedonian constitutional government restricting the king and involving a popular assembly of the army. Hammond  Walbank 2001 pp. 1213.  King 2010 p. 375. In 1931 Friedrich Granier was the first to propose that by the time of Philip IIs reign Macedonia had a constitutional government with laws that delegated rights and customary privileges to certain groups especially to its citizen soldiers although the majority of evidence for the armys alleged right to appoint a new king and judge cases of treason stems from the reign of Alexander III of Macedon. See Granier 1931 pp. 428 4857 and King 2010 pp. 374375. Pietro De Francisci was the first to refute Graniers ideas and advance the theory that the Macedonian government was an autocracy ruled by the whim of the monarch although this issue of kingship and governance is still unresolved in academia. See de Francisci 1948 pp. 345435 as well as King 2010 p. 375 and Errington 1990 p. 220 for further details.  King 2010 p. 379 Errington 1990 p. 221 early evidence for this includes not only Alexander Is role as a commander in the GrecoPersian Wars but also the citystate of Potidaeas acceptance of Perdiccas II of Macedon as their commanderinchief during their rebellion against the Delian League of Athens in 432 BC.  Sawada 2010 pp. 403405. According to Carol J. King there was no certain reference to this institutional group until the military campaigns of Alexander the Great in Asia.King 2010 pp. 380381. However N. G. L. Hammond and F. W. Walbank state that the royal pages are attested to as far back as the reign of Archelaus I of Macedon. Hammond  Walbank 2001 p. 13.  King 2010 p. 382. The ranks of the companions were greatly increased during the reign of Philip II when he expanded this institution to include Upper Macedonian aristocrats as well as Greeks. See Sawada 2010 p. 404.  King 2010 p. 384 the first recorded instance dates to 359 BC when Philip II called together assemblies to address them with a speech and raise their morale following the death of Perdiccas III of Macedon in battle against the Illyrians.  For instance when Perdiccas had Philip IIs daughter Cynane murdered to prevent her own daughter Eurydice II of Macedon from marrying Philip III of Macedon the army revolted and ensured that the marriage took place. See Adams 2010 p. 210 and Errington 1990 pp. 119120 for details.  King 2010 p. 390. Although these were highly influential members of local and regional government Carol J. King asserts that they were not collectively powerful enough to formally challenge the authority of the Macedonian king or his right to rule.  Amemiya 2007 pp. 1112 under Antipaters oligarchy the lower value in terms of property for acceptable members of the oligarchy was 2000 drachma. Athenian democracy was restored briefly after Antipaters death in 319 BC yet his son Cassander reconquered the city which came under the regency of Demetrius of Phalerum. Demetrius lowered the property limit for oligarchic members to 1000 drachma yet by 307 BC he was exiled from the city and direct democracy was restored. Demetrius I of Macedon reconquered Athens in 295 BC yet democracy was once again restored in 287 BC with the aid of Ptolemy I of Egypt. Antigonus II Gonatas son of Demetrius I reconquered Athens in 260 BC followed by a succession of Macedonian kings ruling over Athens until the Roman Republic conquered both Macedonia and then mainland Greece by 146 BC.  Unlike the sparse Macedonian examples ample textual evidence of this exists for the Achaean League Acarnanian League and Achaean League see Hatzopoulos 1996 pp. 366367.  According to Sekunda Philip IIs infantry were eventually equipped with heavier armor such as cuirasses since the Third Philippic of Demosthenes in 341 BC described them as hoplites instead of lighter peltasts Sekunda 2010 pp. 449450 see also Errington 1990 p. 238 for further details. However Errington argues that breastplates were not worn by the phalanx pikemen of either Philip II or Philip Vs reigns during which sufficient evidence exists. Instead he claims that breastplates were worn only by military officers while pikemen wore the kotthybos stomach bands along with their helmets and greaves wielding a daggers as secondary weapons along with their shields. See Errington 1990 p. 241.  Sekunda 2010 pp. 455456. Errington 1990 p. 245 in regards to both the argyraspides and chalkaspides these titles were probably not functional perhaps not even official.  Sekunda 2010 pp. 455457. However in discussing the discrepancies among ancient historians about the size of Alexander the Greats army N. G. L. Hammond and F. W. Walbank choose Diodorus Siculus figure of 32000 infantry as the most reliable while disagreeing with his figure for cavalry at 4500 asserting it was closer to 5100 horsemen. Hammond  Walbank 2001 pp. 2223.  Sekunda 2010 p. 459 Errington 1990 p. 245 Other developments in Macedonian army organization are evident after Alexander. One is the evolution of the hypaspistai from an elite unit to a form of military police or bodyguard under Philip V the only thing the two functions had in common was the particular closeness to the king.  Sekunda 2010 pp. 460461 for the evolution of Macedonian military titles such as its command by tetrarchai officers assisted by grammateis i.e. secretaries or clerks see Errington 1990 pp. 242243.  Sekunda 2010 pp. 461462 Errington 1990 p. 245 The other development which happened at the latest under Doson was the formation and training of a special unit of peltastai separate from the phalanx. This unit operated as a form of royal guard similar in function to the earlier hypaspistai.  Sekunda 2010 p. 463 the largest figure for elite Macedonian peltasts mentioned by ancient historians was 5000 troops an amount that existed in the Social War 220217 BC.  Hatzopoulos 20
11 a p. 44 Woodard 2010 p. 9 see also Austin 2006 p. 4 for further details. Edward M. Anson contends that the native spoken language of the Macedonians was a dialect of Greek and that in the roughly 6300 Macedonianperiod inscriptions discovered by archaeologists about 99 were written in the Greek language using the Greek alphabet.

11 a p. 44 Engels 2010 pp. 9495 Woodard 2010 pp. 910. Hatzopoulos 20
11 a pp. 4345 states that the native language of the ancient Macedonians as preserved in the rare documents written in a language other than Koine Greek also betray a slight phonetic influence from the languages of the original inhabitants of the region who were assimilated or expelled by the invading Macedonians Hatzopoulos also asserts that little is known about these languages aside from Phrygian spoken by the Bryges who migrated to Anatolia. Errington 1990 pp. 34 affirms that the Macedonian language was merely a dialect of Greek that used loanwords from Thracian and Illyrian languages which does not surprise modern philologists but ultimately provided Macedonias political enemies with the proof they needed to level the charge that Macedonians were not Greek.  Woodard 2004 pp. 1214 Hamp Eric Adams Douglas 2013. The Expansion of the IndoEuropean Languages Archived 20140222 at the Wayback Machine SinoPlatonic Papers vol 239. Accessed 16 January 2017. Joseph 2001 Ancient Greek is generally taken to be the only representative though note the existence of different dialects of the Greek or Hellenic branch of IndoEuropean. There is some dispute as to whether Ancient Macedonian the native language of Philip and Alexander if it has any special affinity to Greek at all is a dialect within Greek see below or a sibling language to all the known Ancient Greek dialects. If the latter view is correct then Macedonian and Greek would be the two subbranches of a group within IndoEuropean which could more properly be called Hellenic. Georgiev 1966 pp. 285297 ancient Macedonian is closely related to Greek and Macedonian and Greek are descended from a common GreekMacedonian idiom that was spoken till about the second half of the 
3 rd millennium BC.  For instance Cleopatra VII Philopator the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt spoke Koine Greek as a first language and by her reign 5130 BC or some time before it the Macedonian language was no longer used.

Although Archelaus I of Macedon was criticized by the philosopher Plato supposedly hated by Socrates and the first known Macedonian king to be given the label of barbarian the historian Thucydides held the Macedonian king in glowing admiration especially for his engagement in Panhellenic sports and fostering of literary culture. See Hatzopoulos 20

11 b pp. 6971. Hatzopoulos stresses the fact that Macedonians and other peoples such as the Epirotes and Cypriots despite speaking a Greek dialect worshiping in Greek cults engaging in Panhellenic games and upholding traditional Greek institutions nevertheless occasionally had their territories excluded from contemporary geographic definitions of Hellas and were even considered barbarians by some. See Hatzopoulos 20
11 b pp. 52 7172 Johannes Engels comes to a similar conclusion about the comparison between Macedonians and Epirotes saying that the Greekness of the Epirotes despite them not being considered as refined as southern Greeks never came into question. Engels suggests this perhaps because the Epirotes did not try to dominate the Greek world as Philip II of Macedon had done. See Engels 2010 pp. 8384.  Errington 1990 pp. 34. Errington 1994 p. 4 Ancient allegations that the Macedonians were nonGreek all had their origin in Athens at the time of the struggle with Philip II. Then as now political struggle created the prejudice. The orator Aeschines once even found it necessary to counteract the prejudice vigorously fomented by his opponents to defend Philip on this issue and describe him at a meeting of the Athenian Popular Assembly as being entirely Greek. Demosthenes allegations were lent an appearance of credibility by the fact apparent to every observer that the lifestyle of the Macedonians being determined by specific geographical and historical conditions was different to that of a Greek citystate. This alien way of life was however common to western Greeks of Epirus Akarnania and Aitolia as well as to the Macedonians and their fundamental Greek nationality was never doubted. Only as a consequence of the political disagreement with Macedonia was the issue raised at all.  Champion 2004 p. 41 Demosthenes could drop the barbarian category altogether in advocating an Athenian alliance with the Great King against a power that ranked below any socalled barbarian people the Macedonians. In the case of Aeschines Philip II could be a barbarian due for the vengeance of God but after the orators embassy to Pella in 346 he became a thorough Greek devoted to Athens. It all depended upon ones immediate political orientation with Macedonia which many Greeks instinctively scorned was always infused with deepseated ambivalence.  Anson 2010 pp. 1417 this was manifested in the different mythological genealogies concocted for the Macedonian people with Hesiods Catalogue of Women claiming that the Macedonians descended from Macedon son of Zeus and Thyia and was therefore a nephew of Hellen progenitor of the Greeks. See Anson 2010 p. 16 Rhodes 2010 p. 24. By the end of the 
5 th century BC Hellanicus of Lesbos asserted Macedon was the son of Aeolus the latter a son of Hellen and ancestor of the Aeolians one of the major tribes of the Greeks. As well as belonging to tribal groups such as the Aeolians Dorians Achaeans and Ionians Anson also stresses the fact that some Greeks even distinguished their ethnic identities based on the polis i.e. citystate they originally came from. See Anson 2010 p. 15.  For instance Demosthenes when labeling Philip II of Macedon as a barbarian whereas Polybius called Greeks and Macedonians as homophylos i.e. part of the same race or kin. See Woodard 2010 pp. 910 Johannes Engels also discusses this ambiguity in ancient sources Engels 2010 pp. 8389.  Worthington 2012 p. 319. As pharaoh of the Egyptians he was already titled Son of Ra and considered the living incarnation of Horus by his Egyptian subjects a belief that the Ptolemaic successors of Alexander would foster for their own dynasty in Egypt.

After the priest and Oracle of Zeus Ammon at the Siwa Oasis convinced him that Philip II was merely his mortal father and Zeus his actual father Alexander began styling himself as the Son of Zeus which brought him into contention with some of his Greek subjects who adamantly believed that living men could not be immortals.

The other part of the Greekspeaking world extended from Pelagonia in the north to Macedonia in the south. It was occupied by several tribal states which were constantly at war against Illyrians Paeonians and Thracians. Each state had its own monarchy.
