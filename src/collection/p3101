For discussion of the scientific evidence relating to the race of the ancient Egyptians see Population history of Egypt and Genetic history of Egypt. The Ancient Egyptian classification of ancient peoples from left to right a Libyan a Nubian an Asiatic and an Egyptian. Drawing by an unknown artist after a mural of the tomb of Seti I Copy by Heinrich Menu von Minutoli 1820. In terms of skin colour the Libyan has the lightest complexion followed by the Asiatic who is yellowish in appearance. The Egyptian is reddishbrown while the Nubian is black.1 Each group is also marked with their own distinctive hairstyles and clothing.2 The representation of ethnic groups in Egyptian iconography has been a source of dispute among scholars.34 The question of the race of ancient Egyptians was raised historically as a product of the early racial concepts of the 
18 th and 
19 th centuries and was linked to models of racial hierarchy primarily based on craniometry and anthropometry. A variety of views circulated about the racial identity of the Egyptians and the source of their culture.5 Some scholars argued that ancient Egyptian culture was influenced by other Afroasiaticspeaking populations in North Africa the Horn of Africa or the Middle East while others pointed to influences from various Nubian groups or populations in Europe. In more recent times some writers continued to challenge the mainstream view some focusing on questioning the race of specific notable individuals such as the king represented in the Great Sphinx of Giza native Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun Egyptian Queen Tiye and Greek Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra VII.citation needed Mainstream scholars reject the notion that Egypt was a white or black civilization they maintain that applying modern notions of black or white races to ancient Egypt is anachronistic.678 In addition scholars reject the notion implicit in the notion of a black or white Egypt hypothesis that Ancient Egypt was racially homogeneous instead skin color varied between the peoples of Lower Egypt Upper Egypt and Nubia who in various eras rose to power in Ancient Egypt. Within Egyptian history despite multiple foreign invasions the demographics were not shifted substantially by large migrations.91011 Background In the 
18 th century French philosopher and abolitionist Constantin Franois de Chassebuf comte de Volney in a set of comments regarding the race of the ancient Egyptians wrote that the Copts are the proper representatives of the Ancient Egyptians due to their jaundiced and fumed skin which is neither Greek nor Arab their full faces their puffy eyes their crushed noses and their thick lips...the ancient Egyptians were true Negroes of the same type as all native born Africans.12 Volney also said that the Sphinx gave him the key to the riddle as to why all the Egyptians he saw across the country have a bloated face puffedup eyes flat nose thick lips  in a word the true face of the mulatto. He wrote he was tempted to attribute it to the climate but upon visiting the Sphinx its appearance gave him the answer seeing that head typically negro in all its features13 Volney saw it as the true solution to the enigma of how the modern Egyptians came to have their mulatto appearance. He goes on to postulate the Copts were true negroes of the same stock as all the autochthonous peoples of Africa and they after some centuries of mixing... must have lost the full blackness of its original color.14 Jacques Joseph ChampollionFigeac criticized Volney and called his conclusion evidently forced and inadmissible.15 The leading French scientist of the 
18 th century Georges Cuvier considered the Egyptians to be Caucasian and it was with Cuvier that Augustus Granville sided in the dissection and first scientific autopsy of an ancient Egyptian mummy in 18
25.1 6 Another early example of the controversy is an article published in The NewEngland Magazine of October 1833 where the authors dispute a claim that Herodotus was given as authority for their being negroes. They point out with reference to tomb paintings It may be observed that the complexion of the men is invariably red that of the women yellow but neither of them can be said to have anything in their physiognomy at all resembling the Negro countenance.17 In 1839 JeanFranois Champollion suggested that In the Copts of Egypt we do not find any of the characteristic features of the ancient Egyptian population. The Copts are the result of crossbreeding with all the nations that successfully dominated Egypt. It is wrong to seek in them the principal features of the old race.18 This memoir was made in the context of the first tribes that would have inhabited Egypt his opinion was noted after his return from Nubia. In 1839 Champollions and Volneys claims were disputed by Jacques Joseph ChampollionFigeac who blamed a misunderstanding of the ancients for spreading a false impression of a Negro Egypt stating the two physical traits of black skin and woolly hair are not enough to stamp a race as negro1426 and the opinion that the ancient population of Egypt belonged to the Negro African race is an error long accepted as the truth. ... Volneys conclusion as to the Negro origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization is evidently forced and inadmissible.15 Gaston Maspero a 
19 thcentury French Egyptologist stated that by the almost unanimous testimony of ancient Greek historians they Ancient Egyptians belonged to the African race which settled in Ethiopia.19 Heinrich Karl Brusch a 
19 thcentury German Egyptologist stated that according to ethnology the Egyptians appear to form a third branch of the Caucasian race... and this much may be regarded as certain.20 E.A. Wallis Budge a 
19 thcentury British Egyptologist argued that There are many things in the manners and customs and religions of the historic Egyptians that suggest that the original home of their ancestors was in a country in the neighbourhood of Uganda and Land of Punt.21 The debate over the race of the ancient Egyptians intensified during the 
19 th century movement to abolish slavery in the United States as arguments relating to the justifications for slavery increasingly asserted the historical mental and physical inferiority of black people.22 For example in 1851 John Campbell directly challenged the claims by Champollion and others regarding the evidence for a black Egypt asserting There is one great difficulty and to my mind an insurmountable one which is that the advocates of the negro civilization of Egypt do not attempt to account for how this civilization was lost.... Egypt progressed and why because it was Caucasian.23 The arguments regarding the race of the Egyptians became more explicitly tied to the debate over slavery in the United States as tensions escalated towards the American Civil War.24 In 1854 Josiah C. Nott with George Gliddon set out to prove that the Caucasian or white and the Negro races were distinct at a very remote date and that the Egyptians were Caucasians.25 Samuel George Morton a physician and professor of anatomy concluded that Negroes were numerous in Egypt but their social position in ancient times was the same that it now is in the United States that of servants and slaves.26 Position of modern scholarship Main article Population history of Egypt See also DNA history of Egypt Modern scholars who have studied ancient Egyptian culture and population history have responded to the controversy over the race of the ancient Egyptians in various ways. At the UNESCO Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic script in Cairo in 1974 the Black Hypothesis and the notion of a homogeneous population in Egypt was proposed by Cheikh Anta Diop in his chapter Origins of the Ancient Egyptians. Numerous objections were made to the ideas propounded by Diop. These objections revealed the extent of a disagreement which remained profound even though it was not voiced explicitly. The disagreement was largely due to methodological issues27 for example the insufficient data to enable provisional conclusions to be drawn with regard to the peopling of ancient Egypt and the successive phases through which it may have passed.28 The arguments for all sides are recorded in the UNESCO publication General History of Africa29 with the Origin of the Egyptians chapter being written by Cheikh Anta Diop a proponent of the Black Hypothesis.30 Diops chapter was credited in the general conclusion of the symposium report by the International Scientific Committees Rapporteur Jean Devisse31 as a painstakingly researched contribution consequently there was a real lack of balance in the discussion among participants.3233 At the 1974 UNESCO conference several participants other than Diop and Obenga concluded that the Neolithic Egyptian population was indigenous to the Sahara and was made up of people from north and south of the Sahara who had a range of skin colors.3435 The majority of participants in the conference disagreed with Diops and Obengas views.36 Similarly none of the participants voiced support for an earlier postulation that Egyptians were white with a dark even black pigmentation1443 although Professor Ghallab stated that the inhabitants of Egypt in Palaeolithic times were Caucasoids.1444 A forthcoming General History of Africa Volume IX will update the preexisting volumes with recent research. This volume will feature 60 historians from 28 countries Africa North America Europe Latin America Caribbean and Asia.3738 Subsequent reviewers of the 1974 symposium debate and the UNESCO publication have presented a range of views on the outcome of the debate.39404142 According to Larissa Nordholt the majority of reviewers at the time saw Diops chapter as discrediting the publications scholarly reputation due to the suggested weight on politics.43279 Larissa Nordholt argued that Diops chapter was politically motivated having been published only due to being in line with UNESCOs political imperatives despite clashing with accepted historical methods and standards of academic rigor.44 Peter Shinnie reviewing the GHA volume wrote that It seems that UNESCO and the editor Mokhtar were embarrassed by the unscholarly and preposterous nature of Diops views but were unable to reject his contribution.45 However Bethwell Allan Ogot a Kenyan historian and editor of UNESCO General History of Africa Volume 5 stated that Cheikh Anta Diop wrested Egyptian civilization from the Egyptologists and restored it to the mainstream of African history.46 Stephen Quirke argued that the UNESCOsponsored conference on the General History of Africa in 1974 did not change the Eurocentric climate of research and of the need to incorporate both Africancentred studies and White European academic perspectives. He later outlined that research conferences and publications on the history and language of Kemet Egypt remain dominated beyond 90 by those brought up and trained in European not African societies and languages which include Arabic.47 Since the late 
20 th century as the science of human population genetics has advanced most biological anthropologists have come to reject the notion of race as having any validity in the study of human biology.4849 Frank J. Yurco outlined in a 1989 article that In short ancient Egypt like modern Egypt consisted of a very heterogeneous population.50 He also wrote in 1990 When you talk about Egypt its just not right to talk about black or white .... To take the terminology here in the United States and graft it onto Africa is anthropologically inaccurate. Yurco added that We are applying a racial divisiveness to Egypt that they would never have accepted They would have considered this argument absurd and that is something we could really learn from.51 Yurco wrote in 1996 that the peoples of Egypt the Sudan and much of NorthEast Africa are generally regarded as a Nilotic continuity with widely ranging physical features complexions light to dark various hair and craniofacial types.52 Gamal Mokthar editor of the UNESCO General History of Africa wrote in 1990 that It is more than probable that the African strain black or light is preponderant in the Ancient Egyptian but in the present state of our knowledge it is impossible to say more.53 Egyptologist Miriam Lichtheim in 1990 wrote that The Egyptians were not Nubians and the original Nubians were not black. Nubia gradually became black because black peoples migrated northward out of Central Africa.54 Bernard R. Ortiz De Montellano wrote in 1993 The claim that all Egyptians or even all the pharaohs were black is not valid. Most scholars believe that Egyptians in antiquity looked pretty much as they look today with a gradation of darker shades toward the Sudan.9 Christopher Ehret wrote in 1996 Ancient Egyptian civilization was in ways and to an extent usually not recognized fundamentally African. The evidence of both language and culture reveals these African roots. The origins of Egyptian ethnicity lay in the areas south of Egypt.55 Nancy Lovell wrote in 1999 that studies of skeletal remains indicate that the physical characteristics of ancient southern Egyptians and Nubians were within the range of variation for both ancient and modern indigenous peoples of the Sahara and tropical Africa and that the distribution of population characteristics seems to follow a clinal pattern from south to north which may be explained by natural selection as well as gene flow between neighboring populations. Lovell outlined that In general the inhabitants of Upper Egypt and Nubia had the greatest biological affinity to people of the Sahara and more southerly areas. She also wrote that the archaeological and inscriptional evidence for contact between Egypt and SyroPalestine suggests that gene flow between these areas was very likely and that the early Nile Valley populations were part of an African lineage but exhibiting local variation.56 Stuart Tyson Smith wrote in 2001 Any characterization of race of the ancient Egyptians depends on modern cultural definitions not on scientific study. Thus by modern American standards it is reasonable to characterize the Egyptians as black while acknowledging the scientific evidence for the physical diversity of Africans. He continues Ancient Egyptian practices show strong similarities to modern African cultures including divine kingship the use of headrests body art circumcision and male coming ofage rituals all suggesting an African substratum or foundation for Egyptian civilisation.57 Smith also wrote in 2004 Egyptian art depicts Nubians with stereotypical dark skin facial features hairstyles and dress all very different from Egyptians and the other two ethnic groups Asiatics and Libyans.58 He adds that no single material correlate no matter how abundantly represented unambiguously reflects ethnic group affiliation.59 Sonia Zakrzewski who wrote in 2003 studied skeletal samples from the Badarian period to the Middle Kingdom in Upper Egypt. The raw data suggested that the Ancient Egyptians in general had tropical body plans but that their proportions were actually supernegroid i.e. the limb indices are relatively longer than in many African populations. She proposed that the apparent development of an increasingly African body plan over time may also be due to Nubian mercenaries being included in the Middle Kingdom sample. Although she noted that in spite of the differences in tibiae lengths among the Badarian and Early Dynastic samples that all samples lie relatively clustered together as compared to the other populations. Zakrzewski concluded that the results must remain provisional due to the relatively small sample sizes and the lack of skeletal material that crosscuts all social and economic groups within each time period.60 Donald B. Redford wrote in 2004 that The old notion of waves of races flowing up the Nile Valley effecting cultural change and improvement is now known to be as erroneous as it was simplistic. New ideas need not come by means of invasion occasionally they are indigenous and may parallel similar discoveries elsewhere which are wholly unrelated.61 Robert Morkot wrote in 2005 that The ancient Egyptians were not white in any European sense nor were they Caucasian... we can say that the earliest population of ancient Egypt included African people from the upper Nile African people from the regions of the Sahara and modern Libya and smaller numbers of people who had come from southwestern Asia and perhaps the Arabian peninsula.62 Barry J. Kemp wrote in 2007 that the blackwhite argument though politically understandable is an oversimplification that hinders an appropriate evaluation of the scientific data on the ancient Egyptians since it does not take into consideration the difficulty in ascertaining complexion from skeletal remains. It also ignores the fact that Africa is inhabited by many other populations besides Bantu related Negroid groups. He wrote that in reconstructions of life in ancient Egypt modern Egyptians would therefore be the most logical and closest approximation to the ancient Egyptians. Kemp also wrote that ..sample populations available from northern Egypt from before the 
1 st Dynasty Merimda Maadi and Wadi Digla turn out to be significantly different from sample populations from early Palestine and Byblos suggesting a lack of common ancestors over a long time and the anthropological measurements of ancient Egyptians male limb length proportions had grouped them with Africans rather than with Europeans.63 Barbara Mertz wrote in 2011 Egyptian civilization was not Mediterranean or African Semitic or Hamitic black or white but all of them. It was in short Egyptian.64 Kathryn Bard wrote in 2014 Egyptians were the indigenous farmers of the lower Nile valley neither black nor white as races are conceived of today.65 Federico Puigdevall and Albert Caagueral wrote in 2017 There are defenders of the theory that the pharaohs were black and there are those who maintain they had Caucasian origins. Neither theory is provable.66 Nicky Nielsen wrote in 2020 Ancient Egypt was neither black nor white and the repeated attempt by advocates of either ideology to seize the ownership of ancient Egypt simply perpetuates an old tradition one of removing agency and control of their heritage from the modern population living along the banks of the Nile.67 Marc Van De Mieroop wrote in 2021 Some scholars have tried to determine what Egyptians could have looked like by comparing their skeletal remains with those of recent populations but the samples are so limited and the interpretations so fraught with uncertainties that this is an unreliable approach. He concluded that ancient Egypts location at the edge of northeast Africa and its geography as a corridor between that continent and Asia opened it up to influences from all directions in terms of both culture and of demography.68 S.O.Y. Keita wrote in 2022 on the origins and the identity of the Ancient Egyptians. He examined various forms of evidence which included archaeology historical linguistics and biological data to determine the population affinities. He concluded that various disciplines indicate the groundings of Egypt within Northeastern Africa and the ancient Egyptians were a people and society that emerged in the SaharoNilotic region of Northeast Africa.69 Keita also reviewed studies on the biological affinities of the Ancient Egyptian population and wrote in 1993 that the original inhabitants of the Nile Valley were primarily a variety of indigenous Northeast Africans from the areas of the desiccating Sahara and more southerly areas. He also added that whilst Egyptian society became more socially complex and biologically varied the ethnicity of the NilotoSaharoSudanese origins did not change.70 William Stiebling and Susan Helft wrote in 2023 on the historical debate concerning the race and ethnicity of the ancient Egyptians in light of recent evidence. They argued that the physical appearances would have varied along a continuum from the Delta to the Niles source regions in the south. The authors specified that some ancient Egyptians looked more Middle Eastern and others looked more Sudanese or Ethiopians of today and some may even have looked like other groups in Africa. The authors reached the view that Egypt was a unique civilization with genetic and cultural ties linking it to other African cultures to its south and west and to Mediterranean and Near Eastern cultures to its north.71 Scholarly views on bias in the historical and modern interpretations in the race controversy Various scholars have highlighted the role of colonial racism in shaping the attitudes of early Egyptologists and criticised the continued overrepresentation of North American and European perspectives in the field.7273744275 Diop in his work The African Origin of Civilization argued that the prevailing views in Egyptology were driven by biased scholarship and colonial attitudes.7677 Similarly Bruce Trigger wrote that early modern scholarship on the Nile Valley populations had been marred by a confusion of race language and culture and by an accompanying racism.78 Stuart Tyson Smith wrote in 2018 that a common practice among Egyptologists was to divorce Egypt from its proper northeast African context instead framing it as fundamentally part of a Near Eastern or Mediterranean economic social and political sphere hardly African at all or at best a crossroad between the Near East the eastern Mediterranean and Africa which carries with it the implication that it is ultimately not really part of Africa. He explicitly criticises Van De Mieroops comments that ancient Egypt was clearly in Africa it was not so clearly of Africa as reflecting longstanding Egyptological biases. He concluded that the interrelated cultural features shared between northeast African dynamic and Pharaonic Egypt are not survivals or coincidence but shared traditions with common origins in the deep past.79 Andrea Manzo wrote in 2022 that early Egyptologists had situated the origins of dynastic Egypt within a broad Hamitic horizon that characterised several regions of Africa and that these views had continued to dominate in the second half of the twentieth century. Manzo stated more recent studies had pointed out the relevance of African elements to the rise of Egyptian culture following earlier suggestions on Egyptian kingship and religion by Henri Frankfort which countered the traditional view that considered Egypt more closely linked to the Near East than to the rest of Africa.80 Ehret recounted in 2023 that the previous two centuries of Western scholarship had presented Egypt as an offshoot of earlier Middle Eastern developments. He continued to argue that these old ideas had influenced the attitudes of scholars in other disciplines such as genetics and their approaches even when existing archaeological linguistic and biological anthropological evidence had determined the founding locales of Ancient Egypt to be the descendants of longtime populations in Northeastern Africa which included Nubia and the northern Horn of Africa.81 Genetic studies have been criticised by several scholars for a range of methodological problems and providing misleading racial classifications.82838485868788 Boyce and Keita argued that certain studies have adopted a selective approach in sampling such as using samples drawn mostly from northern Lower Egypt which has historically had the presence of more foreigners from the Mediterranean and the Near East and using those samples as representing the rest of Egypt. Thus excluding the darker south or Upper Egypt which presents a false impression of Egyptian variability. The authors also note that chromosomal patterns have featured inconsistent labelling such as Haplotype V as seen the with use of misleading terms like Arabic to describe it implying this haplotype is of Middle Eastern origins. However when the haplotype V variant is looked at in context it does have a very high prevalence in African countries above the Sahara and in Ethiopia.89 In 2022 Danielle Candelora criticised how modern DNA studies are misused for political and racist agendas. As an example she cites the media echo about the Schuenemann genome study published in 2017 which was sensationalized in the media as proof that Egyptians were not black Africans in spite of its methodological limits and taken by white suprematists as scientific evidence to justify their view on the achievements of the Ancient Egyptian civilisation. Candelora also noted that the media overlooked methodological limitations with the study such as the untested sampling methods small sample size and problematic comparative data.90 However an unpublished followup study in 2022 sampled six different excavation sites along the entire length of the Nile Valley spanning 4000 years of Egyptian history and the 18 high quality mitochondrial genomes that were reconstructed which the authors argued supported the results from the 2017 Schuenemann genome study.91 Presentday controversies Today the issues regarding the race of the ancient Egyptians are troubled waters which most people who write about ancient Egypt from within the mainstream of scholarship avoid.92 The debate therefore takes place mainly in the public sphere and tends to focus on a small number of specific issues. Tutankhamun Mask of Tutankhamun Several scholars including Diop have claimed that Tutankhamun was black and have protested that attempted reconstructions of Tutankhamuns facial features as depicted on the cover of National Geographic magazine have represented the king as too white. Among these writers was Chancellor Williams who argued that King Tutankhamun his parents and grandparents were black.93 Forensic artists and physical anthropologists from Egypt France and the United States independently created busts of Tutankhamun using a CTscan of the skull. Biological anthropologist Susan Anton the leader of the American team said the race of the skull was hard to call. She stated that the shape of the cranial cavity indicated an African while the nose opening suggested narrow nostrils which is usually considered to be a European characteristic. The skull was thus concluded to be that of a North African.94 Other experts have argued that neither skull shapes nor nasal openings are a reliable indication of race.95 Although modern technology can reconstruct Tutankhamuns facial structure with a high degree of accuracy based on CT data from his mummy9697 determining his skin tone and eye color is impossible. The clay model was therefore given a coloring which according to the artist was based on an average shade of modern Egyptians.98 Tiye grandmother of Tutankhamun Terry Garcia National Geographics executive vice president for mission programs said in response to some of those protesting against the Tutankhamun reconstruction The big variable is skin tone. North Africans we know today had a range of skin tones from light to dark. In this case we selected a medium skin tone and we say quite up front This is midrange. We will never know for sure what his exact skin tone was or the color of his eyes with 100 certainty.... Maybe in the future people will come to a different conclusion.99 When pressed on the issue by American activists in September 2007 the Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities Zahi Hawass stated Tutankhamun was not black.100 In a November 2007 publication of Ancient Egypt magazine Hawass asserted that none of the facial reconstructions resemble Tut and that in his opinion the most accurate representation of the boy king is the mask from his tomb.101 The Discovery Channel commissioned a facial reconstruction of Tutankhamun based on CT scans of a model of his skull back in 20
02.1 02103 Stuart Tyson Smith Egyptologist and professor of anthropology at University of California Santa Barbara in 2008 expressed criticism of the forensic reconstruction in a journal review noting that Tutankhamuns face was very lightskinned which reflected a bias among media outlets. He further added that Egyptologists have been strangely reluctant to admit that the ancient Egyptians were rather darkskinned Africans especially the farther south one goes.104 In 2011 the genomics company iGENEA launched a Tutankhamun DNA project based on genetic markers that it indicated it had culled from a Discovery Channel special on the pharaoh. According to the firm the microsatellite data suggested that Tutankhamun belonged to the haplogroup R
1 b
1 a2 the most common paternal clade among males in Western Europe. Carsten Pusch and Albert Zink who led the unit that had extracted Tutankhamuns DNA chided iGENEA for not liaising with them before establishing the project. After examining the footage they also concluded that the methodology the company used was unscientific with Putsch calling them simply impossible.105 A painted wooden figure of Tutankhamun found in his royal tomb A 2020 DNA study by Gad Hawass et al. analysed mitochondrial and Ychromosomal haplogroups from Tutankhamuns family members of the 
18 th Dynasty using comprehensive control procedures to ensure quality results. They found that the Ychromosome haplogroup of the family was R
1 b which originated in Europe and which today makes up 5090 of the genetic pool of modern western Europeans. The mitochondrial haplogroup was K which is most likely also part of a Near Eastern lineage. The profiles for Tutankhamun and Amenhotep III were incomplete and the analysis produced differing probability figures despite having concordant allele results.106 Because the relationships of these two mummies with the KV55 mummy had previously been confirmed in an earlier study the haplogroup prediction of both mummies could be derived from the full profile of the KV55 data. The 
20 th Dynasty pair of Ramesses III and his son were found to have the haplogroup E
1 b
1 a which has its highest frequencies in modern populations from West Africa and Central Africa but which is rare among North Africans and nearly absent in East Africa.106 Genetic analysis indicated the following haplogroups Amenhotep III YDNA R

2 b Tutankhamun YDNA R

2 a  mtDNA K Thuya mtDNA K In 2010 Hawass et al. undertook detailed anthropological radiological and genetic studies as part of the King Tutankhamun Family Project. The objectives included attempting to determine familial relationships among 11 royal mummies of the New Kingdom as well to research for pathological features including potential inherited disorders and infectious diseases.107 In 2022 S.O.Y. Keita analysed 8 Short Tandem loci STR data published as part of these studies by Hawass et al. using an algorithm that only has three choices Eurasians subSaharan Africans and East Asians. Using these three options Keita concluded that the majority of the samples which included the genetic remains of Tutankhamun showed a population affinity with subSaharan Africans in one affinity analysis. However Keita cautioned that this does not mean that the royal mummies lacked other affiliations which he argued had been obscured in typological thinking. Keita further added that different data and algorithms might give different results which reflects the complexity of biological heritage and the associated interpretation.108 According to historian William Stiebling and archaeologist Susan N. Helft conflicting DNA analysis conducted by different research teams on ancient Egyptians such as the Amarna royal mummies which included the remains of Tutankhamun has led to a lack of consensus on the genetic makeup of the ancient Egyptians and their geographic origins.109 Cleopatra Main article Ethnicity of Cleopatra The race and skin color of Cleopatra VII the last active Hellenistic ruler of the Macedonian Greek Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt established in 323 BC has also caused some debate110 although generally not in scholarly sources.111 For example the article Was Cleopatra Black was published in Ebony magazine in 2012112 and an article about Afrocentrism from the St. Louis PostDispatch mentions the question too.113 Mary Lefkowitz Professor Emerita of Classical Studies at Wellesley College traces the main origins of the black Cleopatra claim to the 1946 book by J. A. Rogers called Worlds Great Men of Color although noting that the idea of Cleopatra as black goes back to at least the 
19 th century.114115 Lefkowitz refutes Rogers hypothesis on various scholarly grounds. The black Cleopatra claim was further revived in an essay by afrocentrist John Henrik Clarke chair of African history at Hunter College entitled African Warrior Queens.116 Lefkowitz notes the essay includes the claim that Cleopatra described herself as black in the New Testaments Book of Acts  when in fact Cleopatra had died more than sixty years before the death of Jesus Christ.116 The Berlin Cleopatra now in the Altes Museum 
1 st century BC 117 Scholars identify Cleopatra as essentially of Greek ancestry with some Persian and Sogdian Iranian ancestry based on the fact that her Macedonian Greek family the Ptolemaic dynasty had intermingled with the Seleucid aristocracy of the time.118 Michael Grant states that Cleopatra probably had not a drop of Egyptian blood and that she would have described herself as Greek.119 Duane W. Roller notes that there is absolutely no evidence that Cleopatra was racially black African as claimed by what he dismisses as generally not credible scholarly sources111 although he speculates Cleopatra may have been onefourth Egyptian.120 Part of Rollers argument rests on a speculated earlier marriage between Psenptais II and a certain Berenice once argued to possibly be a daughter of Ptolemy VIII. However this speculation was refuted by Egyptologist Wendy Cheshire.121122 Cleopatras official coinage which she would have approved and the three portrait busts of her which are considered authentic by scholars all match each other and they portray Cleopatra as a Greek woman.123124125126127 Polo writes that Cleopatras coinage presents her image with certainty and asserts that the sculpted portrait of the Berlin Cleopatra head is confirmed as having a similar profile.124 Similar to the Berlin Cleopatra other Roman sculpted portraits of Cleopatra include diademwearing marble heads now located in the Vatican Museums and Archaeological Museum of Cherchell although the latter may instead be a depiction of her daughter Cleopatra Selene II.128129130 Aside from Hellenistic art native Egyptian artworks of Cleopatra include the Bust of Cleopatra in the Royal Ontario Museum131 as well as stonecarved reliefs of the Temple of Hathor in the Dendera Temple complex in Egypt depicting Cleopatra and Caesarion as ruling pharaohs providing offerings to Egyptian deities.132133 In his Kleopatra und die Caesaren 2006 Bernard Andreae contends that this Egyptian basalt statue is like other idealized Egyptian portraits of the queen and does not contain realistic facial features and hence adds little to the knowledge of Cleopatras appearance.134 In 2009 a BBC documentary speculated that Cleopatra might have been part North African. This was based largely on the claims of Hilke Thr of the Austrian Academy of Sciences who in the 19
90 s had examined a headless skeleton of a female child in a 20 BC tomb in Ephesus modern Turkey together with the old notes and photographs of the nowmissing skull. Thr hypothesized the body as that of Arsinoe halfsister to Cleopatra.135136 Arsinoe and Cleopatra shared the same father Ptolemy XII Auletes but may have had different mothers137 with Thr claiming the alleged African ancestry came from the skeleton mother. To date it has never been definitively proved that the skeleton is that of Arsinoe IV. Furthermore craniometry as used by Thr to determine race is based in scientific racism that is now generally considered a pseudoscience that supported exploitation of groups of people to perpetuate racial oppression and distorted future views of the biological basis of race.138 When a DNA test attempted to determine the identity of the child it was impossible to get an accurate reading since the bones had been handled too many times139 and the skull had been lost in Germany during World War II. Numerous studies have shown that cranial variation has a low correlation with race and rather that cranial variation was strongly correlated with climate variables.note 1 Mary Beard states that the age of the skeleton is too young to be that of Arsinoe the bones said to be that of a 15
18 yearold child with Arsinoe being around her mid twenties at her death.155 The 2023 Netflix documentary series Queen Cleopatra which appears to depict Cleopatra as black spurred a lawsuit in Egypt claiming that the documentary was distorting the reality in order to promote Afrocentrism and that Netflixs programs were not in line with Egyptian or Islamic values.156 Similarly an article published by The Telegraph criticized the Netflix documentary stating that Cleopatra was Greek and not a tool in Netflixs war on history.157 Classics scholar Rebecca Futo Kennedy contends that discussing whether someone was black or white is anachronistic and that asking this question says more about modern political investments than attempting to understand antiquity on its own terms.158 Great Sphinx of Giza The Sphinx in profile in 2010 The identity of the model for the Great Sphinx of Giza is unknown.159 Most experts160 believe that the face of the Sphinx represents the likeness of the Pharaoh Khafra although a few Egyptologists and interested amateurs have proposed different hypotheses.citation needed An early description of the Sphinx typically negro in all its features is recorded in the travel notes of a French scholar Volney who visited Egypt between 1783 and 1785161 along with French novelist Gustave Flaubert.162 A similar description was given in the wellknown book163 by Vivant Denon where he described the sphinx as the character is African but the mouth the lips of which are thick.164 Following Volney Denon and other early writers numerous Afrocentric scholars such as Du Bois165166167 Diop168 and Asante169 have characterized the face of the Sphinx as Black or Negroid. American geologist Robert M. Schoch has written that the Sphinx has a distinctive African Nubian or Negroid aspect which is lacking in the face of Khafre.170171 but he was described by others such as Ronald H. Fritze and Mark Lehner of being a pseudoscientific writer.172173 David S. Anderson writes in Lost City Found Pyramid Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices that Van Sertimas claim that the sphinx was a portrait statue of the black pharaoh Khafre is a form of pseudoarchaeology not supported by evidence.174 He compares it to the claim that Olmec colossal heads had African origins which is not taken seriously by Mesoamerican scholars such as Richard Diehl and Ann Cyphers.175 Kemet km in Egyptian hieroglyphs km biliteral kmt place kmt people Ancient Egyptians referred to their homeland as Kmt conventionally pronounced as Kemet. According to Cheikh Anta Diop the Egyptians referred to themselves as Black people or kmt and km was the etymological root of other words such as Kam or Ham which refer to Black people in Hebrew tradition.1427176 A review of David Goldenbergs The Curse of Ham Race and Slavery in Early Judaism Christianity and Islam states that Goldenberg argues persuasively that the biblical name Ham bears no relationship at all to the notion of blackness and as of now is of unknown etymology.177 Diop178 William Leo Hansberry178 and Aboubacry Moussa Lam179 have argued that kmt was derived from the skin color of the Nile valley people which Diop claimed was black.142126 The claim that the ancient Egyptians had black skin has become a cornerstone of Afrocentric historiography.178 At the UNESCO Symposium in 1974 Sauneron Obenga and Diop concluded that KMT and KM meant black.1440 However Sauneron clarified that the adjective Kmtyw means people of the black land rather than black people and that the Egyptians never used the adjective Kmtyw to refer to the various black peoples they knew of they only used it to refer to themselves.180 Mainstream scholars hold that kmt means the black land or the black place and that this is a reference to the fertile black soil that was washed down from Central Africa by the annual Nile inundation. By contrast the barren desert outside the narrow confines of the Nile watercourse was called drt conventionally pronounced deshret or the red land.178181 Raymond Faulkners Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian translates kmt into Egyptians182 Gardiner translates it as the Black Land Egypt.183 Ancient Egyptian art Main article Art of ancient Egypt Painting on the sarcophagus of Queen Ashayet showing the queen with both Egyptian and Nubian servants Painting of the opening of the mouth ceremony being performed on a mummy before the tomb Anubis attending the mummy of the deceased. Ancient Egyptian tombs and temples contained thousands of paintings sculptures and written works which reveal a great deal about the people of that time. However their depictions of themselves in their surviving art and artifacts are rendered in sometimes symbolic rather than realistic pigments. As a result ancient Egyptian artifacts provide sometimes conflicting and inconclusive evidence of the ethnicity of the people who lived in Egypt during dynastic times.184185 In their own art Egyptians are often represented in a color that is officially called dark red according to Diop.186 Arguing against other theories Diop quotes ChampollionFigeac who states one distinguishes on Egyptian monuments several species of blacks differing...with respect to complexion which makes Negroes black or coppercolored.187 Regarding an expedition by King Sesostris Cherubini states the following concerning captured southern Africans except for the panther skin about their loins are distinguished by their color some entirely black others dark brown.188 University of Chicago scholars assert that Nubians are generally depicted with black paint but the skin pigment used in Egyptian paintings to refer to Nubians can range from dark red to brown to black.189 This can be observed in paintings from the tomb of the Egyptian Huy as well as Ramses IIs temple at Beit elWali.190 Also Snowden indicates that Romans had accurate knowledge of negroes of a red coppercolored complexion ... among African tribes.191 Men from The Land of Punt carrying gifts tomb of Rekhmire Stuart Tyson Smith Egyptologist and professor of anthropology at University of California Santa Barbara wrote in 2001 that The scene of an expedition to Punt from Queen Hatshepsuis mortuary complex at Deir elBahri shows Puntites with red skin and facial features similar to Egyptians long or bobbed hair goatee beards and kilts.192 Conversely in 2003 Najovits wrote that Egyptian art depicted Egyptians on the one hand and Nubians and other blacks on the other hand with distinctly different ethnic characteristics and depicted this abundantly and often aggressively. The Egyptians accurately arrogantly and aggressively made national and ethnic distinctions from a very early date in their art and literature.193 He continues There is an extraordinary abundance of Egyptian works of art which clearly depicted sharply contrasted reddishbrown Egyptians and black Nubians.193 Inner back side of the sarcophagus of Ashayet a Nubian wife of Mentuhotep II in the 
11 th Dynasty194 depicting her with male and female Egyptian servants facsimile by Charles K. Wilkinson In 2003 David OConnor and Andrew Reid remarked that Puntite and Egyptian males are assigned similarly reddish skins but Nubians typically have darker one and Libyans at most periods have light coloured yellowish skin. Initially Nubians and Puntities may have been shown as fairly similar in appearance and dress short linen kilts but by ca 1400 BC they are distinctly different.195 Barbara Mertz in 2011 wrote in Red Land Black Land Daily Life in Ancient Egypt The concept of race would have been totally alien to them Ancient Egyptians ...The skin color that painters usually used for men is a reddish brown. Women were depicted as lighter in complexion196 perhaps because they didnt spend so much time out of doors. Some individuals are shown with black skins. I cannot recall a single example of the words black brown or white being used in an Egyptian text to describe a person. She gives the example of one of Thutmose IIIs sole companions who was Nubian or Kushite. In his funerary scroll he is shown with dark brown skin instead of the conventional reddish brown used for Egyptians.64 Table of Nations controversy The Table of Nations from Lepsius First row left to right Aamu Asiatics Nehesu Nubians and Themehu Libyans second row a deity Reth Egyptians Aamu Asiatics However Manu Ampim a professor at Merritt College specializing in African and African American history and culture claims in the book Modern Fraud The Forged Ancient Egyptian Statues of RaHotep and Nofret that many ancient Egyptian statues and artworks are modern frauds that have been created specifically to hide the fact that the ancient Egyptians were black while authentic artworks that demonstrate black characteristics are systematically defaced or even modified. Ampim repeatedly makes the accusation that the Egyptian authorities are systematically destroying evidence that proves that the ancient Egyptians were black under the guise of renovating and conserving the applicable temples and structures. He further accuses European scholars of wittingly participating in and abetting this process.197198 Ampim has a specific concern about the painting of the Table of Nations in the Tomb of Ramesses III KV11. The Table of Nations is a standard painting that appears in a number of tombs and they were usually provided for the guidance of the soul of the deceased.184199 Among other things it described the four races of men as follows translation by E.A. Wallis Budge199 The first are RETH the second are AAMU the third are NEHESU and the fourth are THEMEHU. The RETH are Egyptians the AAMU are dwellers in the deserts to the east and northeast of Egypt the NEHESU are the black races and the THEMEHU are the fairskinned Libyans. The archaeologist Karl Richard Lepsius documented many ancient Egyptian tomb paintings in his work Denkmler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien.200 In 1913 after the death of Lepsius an updated reprint of the work was produced edited by Kurt Sethe. This printing included an additional section called the Ergnzungsband in German which incorporated many illustrations that did not appear in Lepsius original work. One of them plate 48 illustrated one example of each of the four nations as depicted in KV11 and shows the Egyptian nation and the Nubian nation as identical to each other in skin color and dress. Ampim has declared that plate 48 is a true reflection of the original painting and that it proves that the ancient Egyptians were identical in appearance to the Nubians even though he admits no other examples of the Table of Nations show this similarity. He has further accused EuroAmerican writers of attempting to mislead the public on this issue.201 The late Egyptologist Frank J. Yurco visited the tomb of Ramesses III KV11 and in a 1996 article on the Ramesses III tomb reliefs he pointed out that the depiction of plate 48 in the Ergnzungsband section is not a correct depiction of what is actually painted on the walls of the tomb. Yurco notes instead that plate 48 is a pastiche of samples of what is on the tomb walls arranged from Lepsius notes after his death and that a picture of a Nubian person has erroneously been labeled in the pastiche as an Egyptian person. Yurco points also to the much more recent photographs of Erik Hornung as a correct depiction of the actual paintings.202 Erik Hornung The Valley of the Kings Horizon of Eternity 1990. Yurco later concluded that Egyptian iconography reflected various complexions and that current scholarship in Egyptology not acknowledged often by Afrocentrists has demonstrated that the Egyptians were most closely related to Saharan Africans culturally and linguistically and that such Mesopotamian influence can be inferred came through the Nile Delta town of Buto as part of longdistance trade.203 He also noted that the Egyptians made distinctions between groups from Nubia such as Nhsy and Mdja with the former group described as darker with frizzy hair and wore a distinctive dress.203 Ampim nonetheless continues to argue that plate 48 shows accurately the images that stand on the walls of KV11 and he categorically accuses both Yurco and Hornung of perpetrating a deliberate deception for the purposes of misleading the public about the true race of the ancient Egyptians.201 Fayyum mummy portraits The naturalistic Fayum mummy portraits show the diversity of Egyptians in the Roman period. The Roman era Fayum mummy portraits attached to coffins containing the latest dated mummies discovered in the Faiyum Oasis represent a population of both native Egyptians and those with mixed Greek heritage.204 The dental morphology of the mummies align more with the indigenous North African population than Greek or other later colonial European settlers.205 Black queen controversy The late British Africanist Basil Davidson stated Whether the Ancient Egyptians were as black or as brown in skin color as other Africans may remain an issue of emotive dispute probably they were both. Their own artistic conventions painted them as pink but pictures on their tombs show they often married queens shown as entirely black being from the south.206207 Queen AhmoseNefertari of the 
18 th Dynasty AhmoseNefertari is an example. In most depictions of AhmoseNefertari she is pictured with black skin208209 while in some instances her skin is blue210 or red.211 In 1939 Flinders Petrie said an invasion from the south...established a black queen as the divine ancestress of the XVIIIth dynasty212207 He also said a possibility of the black being symbolic has been suggested212 and Nefertari must have married a Libyan as she was the mother of Amenhetep I who was of fair Libyan style.212 In 1961 Alan Gardiner in describing the walls of tombs in the Deir elMedina area noted in passing that AhmoseNefertari was well represented in these tomb illustrations and that her countenance was sometimes black and sometimes blue. He did not offer any explanation for these colors but noted that her probable ancestry ruled out that she might have had black blood.210 In 1974 Diop described AhmoseNefertari as typically negroid.1417 In the controversial book Black Athena the hypotheses of which have been widely rejected by mainstream scholarship Martin Bernal considered her skin color in paintings to be a clear sign of Nubian ancestry.213 In 1981 Michel Gitton noted that while in most artistic depictions of the queen she is pictured with black complexion21484 there are other cases in which she is shown with a pink golden blue or dark red skin color.214745 Gitton called the issue of AhmoseNefertaris black color a serious gap in the Egyptological research which allows approximations or untruths.2142 He pointed out that there is no known depiction of her painted during her lifetime she is represented with the same light skin as other represented individuals in tomb TT15 before her deification the earliest black skin depiction appears in tomb TT161 circa 150 years after her death.214111223745215125 Barbara Lesko wrote in 1996 that AhmoseNefertari was sometimes portrayed by later generations as having been black although her coffin portrait gives her the typical light yellow skin of women.216 A plate from Monumenti dellEgitto e della Nubia. The gods shown here have varying skin tones including yellow brown blue and black. In 2003 Betsy Bryan wrote in The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt that the factors linking Amenhotep I and his mother with the necropolis region with deified rulers and with rejuvenation generally was visually transmitted by representations of the pair with black or blue skin  both colours of resurrection.217 In 2004 Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton recognized in a later depiction of the queen the black skin of a deity of resurrection in connection to her role as a patron goddess of the Theban necropolis.215125 Scholars such as Joyce Tyldesley Sigrid HodelHoenes and Graciela Gestoso Singer argued that the skin color of AhmoseNefertari is indicative of her role as a goddess of resurrection since black is both the color of the fertile land of Egypt and that of Duat the underworld.208 Singer recognizes that Some scholars have suggested that this is a sign of Nubian ancestry.208 Singer also states a statuette of AhmoseNefertari at the Museo Egizio in Turin which shows her with a black face though her arms and feet are not darkened thus suggesting that the black coloring has an iconographic motive and does not reflect her actual appearance.218902192082207879 In 2014 Margaret Bunson wrote that the unusual depictions of AhmoseNefertari in blueblack tones of deification reflect her status and cult.221 In a wooden votive statue of AhmoseNefertari currently in the Louvre museum her skin was painted red211 a color commonly seen symbolizing life or a higher being or elevated status.57 Historical hypotheses Since the second half of the 
20 th century typological and hierarchical models of race have increasingly been rejected by scientists and most scholars have held that applying modern notions of race to ancient Egypt is anachronistic.222223224 The current position of modern scholarship is that the Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development see population history of Egypt.22522652227228229 At the UNESCO symposium in 1974 several participants concluded that the ancient Egyptian population was indigenous to the Nile Valley and was made up of people from north and south of the Sahara who were differentiated by their color.34230 Black Egyptian hypothesis Further information Kerma culture Kingdom of Kush and Twentyfifth Dynasty of Egypt The Black Egyptian hypothesis is the hypothesis that ancient Egypt was a Black homogeneous civilization.231232 At a UNESCO symposium in 1974 there was consensus that Ancient Egypt was indigenous to Africa.32 However Diops hypothesis that Ancient Egypt was a Black civilization was met with numerous objections in 1974 which revealed a disagreement which remained profound even though it was not voiced explicitly. In respect of certain sequences the criticisms arose out of the line of argument put forward.233 The majority of the objections raised were of methodological nature which ranged from the need for reliable statistical data to further research projects in several fields such as archaeology and physical anthropology before final conclusions on the peopling of Egypt could be made.234 There was also total disagreement from the majority of scholars in the 1974 conference36 on the hypothesis that Ancient Egypt had been a homogenous population until Persian times with several scholars favouring the hypothesis of a mixed population.235236 Subsequent reviewers of the 1974 symposium debate and the UNESCO publication have presented a range of views on the outcome of the debate.39404142 Larissa Nordholt argued that Diops chapter was politically motivated having been published only due to being in line with UNESCOs political imperatives despite clashing with accepted historical methods and standards of academic rigor. Nordholdt argued that Diops views aligned with the decolonization efforts of the General History of Africa but that he premised his arguments on outdated racialism which classified humanity into distinct groups with a biological essence. However she did state that the contributors did come to a general consensus that the Egyptians could not have been white in the same way that Europeans were and the dissemination of Diops ideas contributed to a wider recognition that the Ancient Egypt was an African civilisation although his methods were not considered entirely permissible by most of the other GHA historians44 According to Larissa Nordholdt Many reviewers however still objected to what they identified as an overtly political ideology within the GHA. They did not necessarily object to the flavour of that ideology but rather to the presence of a political agenda as such. Often Diops chapter seemed to serve as a catalyst for that sentiment.43268279 Peter Shinnie reviewing the General History of Africa volume wrote that It seems that UNESCO and the editor Mokhtar were embarrassed by the unscholarly and preposterous nature of Diops views but were unable to reject his contribution.45 However Bethwell Allan Ogot a Kenyan historian and editor of UNESCO General History of Africa Volume 5 stated that Cheikh Anta Diop wrested Egyptian civilization from the Egyptologists and restored it to the mainstream of African history.46 Stephen Quirke argued that the UNESCOsponsored conference on the General History of Africa in 1974 did not change the Eurocentric climate of research and of the need to incorporate both Africancentred studies and White European academic perspectives. He later outlined that research conferences and publications on the history and language of Kemet Egypt remain dominated beyond 90 by those brought up and trained in European not African societies and languages which include Arabic.237 The Black Egyptian hypothesis includes a particular focus on links to Sub Saharan cultures and the questioning of the race of specific notable individuals from Dynastic times including Tutankhamun238 the person represented in the Great Sphinx of Giza231239240 and the Greek Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra.241242243244 Advocates of the Black African model rely heavily on writings from Classical Greek historians including Strabo Diodorus Siculus Ammianus Marcellinus and Herodotus. Advocates claim that these classical authors referred to Egyptians as Black with woolly hair.note 2 The Greek word used was melanchroes and the English language translation of this Greek word is disputed being translated by many as darkskinned249250 and by many others as black.note 
3 note 6 Other claims used to support the Black Hypothesis included anthropological measurements of Egyptian mummies testing melanin levels in a small sample of mummies142037276 language affinities between ancient Egyptian language and subsaharan languages142839415455277 interpretations of the origin of the name Kmt conventionally pronounced Kemet used by the ancient Egyptians to describe themselves or their land depending on points of view14273840 biblical traditions278142728 shared B blood group between Egyptians and West Africans1437 and interpretations of the depictions of the Egyptians in numerous paintings and statues.279 The hypothesis also claimed cultural affiliations such as circumcision280 matriarchy totemism hair braiding head binding281 and kingship cults.282 Artifacts found at Qustul near Abu Simbel  Modern Sudan in 196064 were seen as showing that ancient Egypt and the AGroup culture of Nubia shared the same culture and were part of the greater Nile Valley substratum283284285286287 but more recent finds in Egypt indicate that the Qustul rulers probably adoptedemulated the symbols of Egyptian pharaohs.288289290291292293 Authors and critics state the hypothesis is primarily adopted by Afrocentrists.294295296297298299300301 The current position of modern scholarship is that the Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development see population history of Egypt.22522652227228229 Asiatic race theory This theory was the most dominant view from the Early Middle Ages c. 500 AD until the early 
19 th century.5302163 The descendants of Ham were traditionally considered to be the darkestskinned branch of humanity either because of their geographic allotment to Africa or because of the Curse of Ham.303163 Thus Diop cited Gaston Maspero Moreover the Bible states that Mesraim son of Ham brother of Chus Kush ... and of Canaan came from Mesopotamia to settle with his children on the banks of the Nile.304 By the 
20 th century the Asiatic race theory and its various offshoots were abandoned but were superseded by two related theories the Eurocentric Hamitic hypothesis asserting that a Caucasian racial group moved into North and East Africa from early prehistory subsequently bringing with them all advanced agriculture technology and civilization and the Dynastic race theory proposing that Mesopotamian invaders were responsible for the dynastic civilization of Egypt c. 3000 BC. In sharp contrast to the Asiatic race theory neither of these theories proposes that Caucasians were the indigenous inhabitants of Egypt.305 At the UNESCO Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic Script in Cairo in 1974 none of the participants explicitly voiced support for any theory where Egyptians were Caucasian with a dark pigmentation.144329 The current position of modern scholarship is that the Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development see population history of Egypt.22522652227228229 Caucasian  Hamitic hypothesis Further information Hamites 1889 ethnographic map of Africa showing the supposed Hamites in white. The Caucasian hypothesis which has been rejected by mainstream scholarship is the hypothesis that the Nile valley was originally peopled by a branch of the Caucasian race.306 It was proposed in 1844 by Samuel George Morton who acknowledged that Negroes were present in ancient Egypt but claimed they were either captives or servants.307 George Gliddon 1844 wrote Asiatic in their origin .... the Egyptians were white men of no darker hue than a pure Arab a Jew or a Phoenician.308 The similar Hamitic hypothesis which has been rejected by mainstream scholarship developed directly from the Asiatic Race Theory and argued that the Ethiopid and Arabid populations of the Horn of Africa were the inventors of agriculture and had brought all civilization to Africa. It asserted that these people were Caucasians not Negroid. It also rejected any Biblical basis despite using Hamitic as the theorys name.309 Charles Gabriel Seligman in his Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the AngloEgyptian Sudan 1913 and later works argued that the ancient Egyptians were among this group of Caucasian Hamites having arrived in the Nile Valley during early prehistory and introduced technology and agriculture to primitive natives they found there.310 The Italian anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi 1901 believed that ancient Egyptians were the Eastern African Hamitic branch of the Mediterranean race which he called Eurafrican. According to Sergi the Mediterranean race or Eurafrican contains three varieties or subraces the African Hamitic branch the Mediterranean proper branch and the Nordic depigmented branch.311 Sergi maintained in summary that the Mediterranean race excluding the depigmented Nordic or white is a brown human variety neither white nor Negroid but pure in its elements that is to say not a product of the mixture of Whites with Negroes or Negroid peoples.312 Grafton Elliot Smith modified the theory in 1911313 stating that the ancient Egyptians were a dark haired brown race314 most closely linked by the closest bonds of racial affinity to the Early Neolithic populations of the North African littoral and South Europe315 and not Negroid.316 Smiths brown race is not synonymous or equivalent with Sergis Mediterranean race.317 The Hamitic Hypothesis was still popular in the 19
60 s and late 19
70 s and was supported notably by Anthony John Arkell and George Peter Murdock.318319 At the UNESCO Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic Script in Cairo in 1974 none of the participants explicitly voiced support for any theory where Egyptians were Caucasian with a dark pigmentation.144329 The current position of modern scholarship is that the Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development see population history of Egypt.22522652228227320 Turanid race hypothesis Further information Turanid race The Turanid race hypothesis which has been rejected by mainstream scholarship is the hypothesis that the ancient Egyptians belonged to the Turanid race linking them to the Tatars. It was proposed by Egyptologist Samuel Sharpe in 1846 who was inspired by some ancient Egyptian paintings which depict Egyptians with sallow or yellowish skin. He said From the colour given to the women in their paintings we learn that their skin was yellow like that of the Mongul Tartars who have given their name to the Mongolian variety of the human race.... The single lock of hair on the young nobles reminds us also of the Tartars.321 The current position of modern scholarship is that the Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development see population history of Egypt.22522652227228229 Dynastic race theory Main article Dynastic race theory Further information EgyptMesopotamia relations The Dynastic race theory which has been rejected by modern scholarship is the hypothesis that a Mesopotamian force had invaded Egypt in predynastic times imposed itself on the indigenous Badarian people and become their rulers.225322 The Mesopotamianfounded state or states were supposed to have conquered both Upper and Lower Egypt and founded the First Dynasty of Egypt. The theory was proposed in the early 
20 th century by Flinders Petrie who deduced that skeletal remains found at predynastic sites at Naqada Upper Egypt indicated the presence of two different races with one race differentiated physically by a noticeably larger skeletal structure and cranial capacity.323 Petrie also noted new architectural stylesthe distinctly Mesopotamian nichedfaade architecturepottery styles cylinder seals and a few artworks as well as numerous predynastic rock and tomb paintings depicting Mesopotamian style boats symbols and figures. Based on plentiful cultural evidence Petrie concluded that the invading ruling elite was responsible for the seemingly sudden rise of Egyptian civilization. In the 19
50 s the dynastic race theory was widely accepted.226322225 While there is clear evidence the Naqada II culture borrowed abundantly from Mesopotamia the Naqada II period had a large degree of continuity with the Naqada I period324 and the changes which did happen during the Naqada periods happened over significant amounts of time.325 The most commonly held view today is that the achievements of the First Dynasty were the result of a long period of cultural and political development225 and the current position of modern scholarship is that the Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development.22522652326227229 Frank Yurco stated that depictions of pharonic iconography such as the royal crowns Horus falcons and victory scenes were concentrated in the Upper Egyptian Naqada culture and AGroup Nubia. He further elaborated that Egyptian writing arose in Naqadan Upper Egypt and AGroup Nubia and not in the Delta cultures where the direct Western Asian contact was made which further vititates the Mesopotamianinfluence argument.327 According to David Wengrow the AGroup polity of the late 
4 th millenninum BCE is poorly understood since most of the archaeological remains are submerged underneath Lake Nasser.328 The Senegalese Egyptologist Cheikh Anta Diop fought against the dynastic race theory with his own Black Egyptian theory and claimed among other things that Eurocentric scholars supported the dynastic race theory to avoid having to admit that Ancient Egyptians were black.329 Martin Bernal proposed that the dynastic race theory was conceived by European scholars to deny Egypt its African roots.330 Reactions in modern Egypt In 2023 American comedian Kevin Harts planned tour of Egypt was cancelled after an uproar on Egyptian social media over Afrocentric claims made by Hart about Egyptian history.331 In response to the Hart controversy Egyptian Egyptologist Zahi Hawass stated that Africans have nothing to do with the pyramids scientifically332333 Hawass has previously commented on the race controversy and expressed the view that the Ancient Egyptians were not black and We believe that the origin of Ancient Egyptians was purely Egyptian based on the discovery made by British Egyptologist Flinders Petrie at Naqada and this is why the Ancient Egyptian civilisation did not occur in Africa it occurred only here.334 Hawass had also affirmed that No Africans built the pyramids because Kushites didnt exist at the period when the pyramids were built and dismissed the notions that Egyptians are Black Africans despite our presence in Africa.335 See also African historiography Afrocentrism Biological anthropology Demographics of Egypt DNA history of Egypt Dynastic race theory Egyptomania Egyptian nationalism Eurocentrism Genetic history of the Middle East Genetic history of Africa Hamitic hypothesis History of anthropology Historical race concepts IndoAryan Migration controversy Pharaonism Scientific racism UNESCO General History of Africa Notes  In 1912 Franz Boas argued that cranial shape was heavily influenced by environmental factors and could change within a few generations under differing conditions thereby making the cephalic index an unreliable indicator of inherited influences such as ethnicity.140 Gravlee Bernard and Leonard 2003141142 Beals Smith and Dodd 1984 and Williams and Armelagos 2005 similarly posited that race and cranial variation had low correlations and proposed that cranial variation was instead strongly correlated with climate variables.143144 Brace 1993 differentiated adaptive cranial traits from nonadaptive cranial traits asserting that only the nonadaptive cranial traits served as reliable indicators of genetic relatedness between populations.145 This was further corroborated in studies by von CramonTaubadel 2008 20

11.1 46147148 Clement and Ranson 1998 estimated that cranial analysis yields a 7795 rate of accuracy in determining the racial origins of human skeletal remains.149 FORDISC an interactive discriminant functions program150 is used by forensic anthropologists to assist in the creation of a decedents biological profile when only parts of the cranium are available. The software uses discriminant function analysis to sort individuals into specific groups that are defined by certain criteria151 by comparing potential profiles to data contained in a database of skeletal measurements of modern humans.152 However a 2009 study found that even in favourable circumstances FORDISC 
3.0  can be expected to classify no more than 1 percent of specimens with confidence.153 In 2012 research presented at the 
81 st Annual Meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists concluded that ForDisc ancestry determination was not always consistent that the program does not perform to expectations and that it should be used with caution.154  245246247316321232525324821  24623252532481560251252253  2592601261262263264  265266267268269270271272273274275  Diop said Herodotus applied melanchroes to both Ethiopians and Egyptians...and melanchroes is the strongest term in Greek to denote blackness.254 According to historian and classicist to Alan B. Lloyd there is no linguistic justification for relating the term Melanchroes to blacks since it could denote any colour from bronzed to black LSJ p. 1094 b.255 Snowden claims that Diop is distorting his classical sources and is quoting them selectively.256 According to Snowden both Egyptians and Ethiopians as melanes but mentions only Ethiopians not Egyptians as having exceedingly woolly hair. In short Ethiopians whose skin was the blackest and whose hair was the woolliest or most tightly curled of all mankind were the only people in classical texts who correspond roughly to the concept of blacks or Negroes as generally understood in modern usage.257 Keita specified that the historical accounts of the ancient Greeks were of limited value as they were not working within modern science and it remained unclear if distinctions between Egyptians and Ethiopians were cultural rather than biological at certain times. He also added that some Greeks reported that Egypt was an Ethiopian colony.258 There is dispute about the historical accuracy of the works of Herodotus  some scholars support the reliability of Herodotusnote 4 while other scholars regard his works as being unreliable as historical sources particularly those relating to Egypt.note 5 References  Burrell Kevin 2019.

9 th International Symposium on Biomolecular Archaeology. 2021. p. 126. In a previous study we assessed the genetic history of a single site Abusir elMeleq from 1388 BCE to 426 CE. We now focus on widening the geographic scope to give a general overview of the population genetic background focusing on mitochondrial haplogroups present among the whole Egyptian Nile River Valley. We collected 81 tooth hair bone and soft tissue samples from 14 mummies and 17 skeletal remains. The samples span approximately 4000 years of Egyptian history and originate from six different excavation sites covering the whole length of the Egyptian Nile River Valley. NGS 127 based ancient DNA 8 were applied to reconstruct 18 highquality mitochondrial genomes from 10 different individuals. The determined mitochondrial haplogroups match the results from our Abusir elMeleq study.  Kemp 2006 p. 47.  Williams Chancellor 1987. The Destruction of Black Civilization.
