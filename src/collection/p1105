31.8 21361 Type Settlement An official wearing the mushroomheaded hairstyle also seen in contemporary paintings of Western Asiatic foreigners from Avaris the capital of the Hyksos. Dated to 18021640 BC. Staatliche Sammlung fr gyptische Kunst.1234 Avaris vrs Egyptian w.t wr.t sometimes hutwaret Ancient Greek  romanized Auaris Greek  romanized varis Arabic  romanized Hawwara5 was the Hyksos capital of Egypt located at the modern site of Tell elDaba in the northeastern region of the Nile Delta.6 As the main course of the Nile migrated eastward its position at the hub of Egypts delta emporia made it a major capital suitable for trade.7 It was occupied from about the 
18 th century BC until its capture by Ahmose I. Etymologyedit The name in the Egyptian language of the 
2 nd millennium BC was probably pronounced atWar House of the Region and denotes the capital of an administrative division of the land wr.t. Today the name Hawara survives referring to the site at the entrance to Faiyum. Alternatively Clement of Alexandria referred to the name of this city as Athyria.8 Excavationsedit Scarab bearing the name of the Hyksos King Apepi now at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston In 1885 the Swiss douard Naville started the first excavations in the area around TellelDaba. Between 1941 and 1942 Labib Habachi an Egyptian Egyptologist first forwarded the idea that the site could be identified with Avaris. Between 1966 and 1969 and since 1975 the site has been excavated by the Austrian Archaeological Institute.9 Using radar imaging technology its scientists could identify in 2010 the outline of the city including streets houses a port and a side arm of the River Nile passing through the city.10 The site at Tell elDaba covering an area of about 2 square kilometers is in ruins today but excavations have shown that at one point it was a welldeveloped center of trade with a busy harbour catering to over 300 ships during a trading season.11 Artifacts excavated at a temple erected in the Hyksos period have produced goods from all over the Aegean world. The temple even has Minoanlike wall paintings that are similar to those found on Crete at the Palace of Knossos. A large mudbrick tomb has also been excavated to the west of the temple where grave goods such as copper swords have been found. Historyedit The site was originally founded by Amenemhat I on the eastern branch of the Nile in the Delta.12 Its close proximity to Asia made it a popular town for Asiatic immigrants. Many of these immigrants were from Judea and they were culturally Egyptianized using Egyptian pottery but also retained many aspects of their own culture as can be seen from the various Asiatic burials including weapons of SyroJudean origin. One palatial district appears to have been abandoned as a result of an epidemic during the 
13 th dynasty.13 In the 
18 th century BC the Hyksos conquered Lower Egypt and set up Avaris as their capital. Kamose the last pharaoh of the Seventeenth Dynasty besieged Avaris but was unable to defeat the Hyksos there. A few decades later Ahmose I captured Avaris and overran the Hyksos. Canaanitestyle artifacts dated to the Tuthmosid or New Kingdom period suggest that a large part of the citys Semitic population remained in residence following its reconquest by the Egyptians.14 The pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty set up a capital in Thebes and the palatial complex at Avaris was briefly abandoned but areas such as the Temple of Seth and G6 region remained continuously occupied.15 It appears as well that the site of Avaris had gone through a hiatus dated after the time of Amenhotep II and until the late 
18 th dynasty.1617 After Ramesses II constructed the city of PiRamesses roughly 2 km 
1.2  mi to the north Avaris was superseded by PiRamesses18 and thus finally abandoned during the Ramesside period.1920 Large portions of the former site of Avaris were used by the inhabitants of PiRamesses as a cemetery and burial ground21 and part of it was used as a major navy base22 while the Harbor of Avaris toponym continued to be used for Avaris harbor through the Ramesside period.2324 The name Avaris is also referred to in Papyrus Sallier I in the late 
13 th century BC.25 In addition the Avaris toponym is also known to Manetho in the 
3 rd century BC quoted by Josephus in his Against Apion

4.2 6 Urban chronologyedit Stratiagraphic layers MN Amenemhet I 
12 th dynasty planned a settlement called Hutwaret located in the 
19 th Nome circa 1930 BC. It was a small Egyptian town until about 1830 BC when it began to grow by immigration of Canaanites Levant Middle Bronze Age IIA By 1800 BC it was a much larger trade colony under Egyptian control. Over the next 100 years immigration increased the size of the city.27 Scarabs with the name Retjenu have been found in Avaris also dating to the 
12 th Dynasty 19911802 BCE.28 Stratiagraphic layers G At about 1780 a temple to Set was built. The Canaanites living at Avaris considered the Egyptian god Set to be the Canaanite god Hadad. Both were weather gods.27 Stratiagraphic layers F Around 1700 BC a temple district to the Canaanite Asherah and the Egyptian Hathor was built in the eastern part of the city. From 1700 onward social stratification begins and an elite arise.27 Stratiagraphic layers E In 1650 the Hyksos arrive and the city grows to 250 ha. It is believed that Avaris was the largest city in the world from 1670 to 1557 BC. A large citadel was built around 15
50.2 7 Minoan connectionedit Further information Minoan frescoes from Tell elDaba Fragment of a Minoan fresco found in Avaris Egypt. This fresco is very similar to another fresco from Knossos Crete. Avaris along with Tel Kabri in Israel and Alalakh in Syria also has a record of Minoan civilization which is otherwise quite rare in the Levant. Manfred Bietak an Austrian archaeologist and the excavator of Tell Daba has speculated that there was close contact with the rulers of Avaris and that the large building featuring the frescoes allowed the Minoans to have a ritual life in Egypt. French archaeologist Yves Duhoux proposed the existence of a Minoan colony on an island in the Nile Delta.29 See alsoedit List of ancient Egyptian towns and cities List of historical capitals of Egypt Referencesedit  Candelora Danielle.
