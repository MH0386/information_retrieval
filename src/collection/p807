It lasted between 75 ca. 17251650 BC and 155 years ca. 18051650 BC depending on the scholar. The capital of the dynasty was probably Avaris.1 The 
14 th Dynasty existed concurrently with the 
13 th Dynasty based in Memphiscitation needed. Some of the contested rulers of the 
14 th Dynasty proposed by Kim Ryholt are commonly identified by Egyptologists as being of Canaanite Semitic descent owing to the distinct origins of the names of some of their kings and princes like Ipqu West Semitic for grace Yakbim iaakbiim an Amorite name Qareh West Semitic for the bald one or YaqubHar.1 Names in relation with Nubia are also recorded in two cases king Nehesy The Nubian and queen Tati. However the dynasty rulers are not referred to as Hyksos in the Turin kings list.2 Chronologyedit The 
14 th Dynasty is commonly grouped together with the 
13 th 
15 th 
16 th and 
17 th as the Second Intermediate Period. Less commonly the 
14 th Dynasty is combined with the 
11 th 
12 th and 
13 th Dynasties in the Middle Kingdom of Egypt period though the 
14 th Dynasty overlaps at least partially with either of or both of the 
13 th Dynasty and the 
15 th Dynasty. There are enough gaps in the knowledge of the 
14 th Dynasty that its absolute chronological position is debated and can vary by as much as 75 years between authorities. Egyptologist Kim Ryholt proposes that the 
14 th Dynasty emerged during the late 
12 th Dynasty ca. 1805 BC during or shortly after Sobekneferus rule. He contends that the local Canaanite population residing in the eastern Delta declared their independence and staved off possible attempts from the 
13 th Dynasty Memphite kings to recover the Delta. According to Ryholt the 
14 th Dynasty lasted from 1805 BC until its demise under the Hyksos 
15 th Dynasty ca. 1650 BC lasting a total of 155 years. This hypothesis is not shared by some Egyptologists such as Manfred Bietak Daphna Ben Tor and James and Susan Allen who argue that the 
14 th Dynasty could not have emerged before the mid 
13 th Dynasty ca. 1720 BC after the reign of Sobekhotep IV.34 In particular they argue that the evidence from the strata levels where 
14 th Dynasty seals have been discovered conclusively establishes that the 
14 th Dynasty was only contemporary with the 
13 th Dynasty in the last half century of the latters existence i.e. after ca. 1700 BC. Additionally Manfred Bietak has dated the inscriptions and monuments of Nehesy possibly the second ruler of the 
14 th Dynasty to around 1700 BC as well.5 Following the very short reign of Nehesy most scholars  including Manfred Bietak and Kim Ryholt  agree that the Delta region was struck by a prolonged famine and perhaps a plague lasting until the end of the 
14 th Dynasty.16 The same famine may have affected the 
13 th Dynasty which also exhibits instability and numerous ephemeral kings in its last 50 years of existence from ca. 1700 BC until 1650 BC. The weakened state of both kingdoms may explain in part why they fell rapidly to the emerging Hyksos power around 1650 BC.1 Seat of poweredit The Manethonian tradition credits the 
14 th Dynasty with as many as 76 kings ruling from Xois rather than Avaris. However Egyptologist Kim Ryholt notes that the Turin Canon mentions only approximately 56 kings and does not have enough space to have recorded more than 70. Ryholt also points to excavations at Avaris that revealed the existence of a large royal palace dating to the Second Intermediate Period. One of its courtyards housed a statue of a king or highranking official over twice lifesize and possessing nonEgyptian attributes. For these reasons Ryholt and most Egyptologists share the view that Avaris  rather than Xois  was the 
14 th Dynastys seat of power.1 Extent of rule and foreign relationsedit The precise borders of the 
14 th Dynasty state are not known due to the general scarcity of its monuments. In his study of the Second Intermediate Period Kim Ryholt concludes that the territory directly controlled by the 
14 th Dynasty roughly consisted of the Nile Delta with borders located near Athribis in the western Delta and Bubastis in the east.1 Seals attributable to the 
14 th Dynasty have been found in Middle and Upper Egypt  then entirely the territory of the 
13 th Dynasty  and as far south as Dongola beyond the Niles Third Cataract. To the north seals have been found in the southern Levant principally along the Mediterranean coast even as far north as Tel Kabri in modernday northern Israel near the border with Lebanon.1 This indicates the existence of important trade conducted between the 
13 th Dynasty the Canaanite citystates and Nubia.1 Ryholt further proposes that king Sheshi whom he sees as a 
14 th Dynasty ruler married a Nubian princess queen Tati to strengthen relations with the Kushite kingdom.1 Rulersedit The order of rulers for this dynasty is established by the Turin Royal Canon and is widely accepted  except for the first five rulers which are given below after Ryholt.1 The names of these rulers are not given on the Turin Canon except for perhaps one and Ryholt proposes that they were mentioned as wsf in the list which denotes a lacuna in the original document from which the list was copied during the Ramesside period.1 Rather Ryholt identifies the first five kings thanks to a seriation of their seals. His conclusions are debated however in Ben Tors study of the strata levels in which seals attributed to the first five kings have been found. Ben Tor concludes that the reigns of Sheshi Ammu and Yakbim date to the second half of the Hyksos 
15 th Dynasty and are not contemporary with the 
13 th Dynasty. According to Ben Tor these kings were most likely minor vassal rulers of the Hyksos kings that ruled over the Nile Delta.3
