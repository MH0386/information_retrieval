It immediately follows the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt possibly by Narmer2 and marks the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period when power was centered at Thinis. The date of this period is subject to scholarly debate about the Egyptian chronology. It falls within the early Bronze Age and is variously estimated to have begun anywhere between the 
34 th and the 
30 th centuries BC. In a 2013 study based on radiocarbon dates the accession of HorAha the second king of the First Dynasty was placed between 3111 and 3045 BC with 68 confidence and between 3218 and 3035 with 95 confidence.3 The same study placed the accession of Den the sixth king of the dynasty between 2928 and 2911 BC with 68 confidence3 although a 2023 radiocarbon analysis placed Dens accession potentially earlier between 3011 and 2921 within a broader window of 3104 to 29
13.4  The dynastyedit See also First Dynasty of Egypt family tree Information about this dynasty is derived from a few monuments and other objects bearing royal names the most important being the Narmer Palette and Narmer Macehead as well as Den and Qaa king lists.567 No detailed records of the first two dynasties have survived except for the terse lists on the Palermo Stone. The account in Manethos Aegyptiaca contradicts both the archeological evidence and the other historical records Manetho names nine rulers of the First Dynasty only one of whose names matches the other sources and offers information for only four of them.8 Egyptian hieroglyphs were fully developed by then and their shapes would be used with little change for more than three thousand years.citation needed Alena Buis noted Large tombs of pharaohs at Abydos and Naqada in addition to cemeteries at Saqqara and Helwan near Memphis reveal structures built largely of wood and mud bricks with some small use of stone for walls and floors. Stone was used in quantity for the manufacture of ornaments vessels and occasionally for statues. Tamarix tamarisk or salt cedar was used to build boats such as the Abydos boats. One of the most important indigenous woodworking techniques was the fixed mortise and tenon joint. A fixed tenon was made by shaping the end of one timber to fit into a mortise hole that is cut into a second timber. A variation of this joint using a free tenon eventually became one of the most important features in Mediterranean and Egyptian shipbuilding. It creates a union between two planks or other components by inserting a separate tenon into a cavity mortise of the corresponding size cut into each component. Alena Buis PhD9 A study on First Dynasty crania from the royal tombs in Abydos noted affinities with Kerma Kushites. The general results demonstrate greater affinity with Upper Nile Valley groups but also suggest clear change from earlier craniometric trends. The gene flow and movement of northern officials to the important southern city may explain the findings.10 The Narmer Palette Narmer Macehead Necklaces with different types of beads. Carnelian coral and garnet. Pottery jar with integral strainer. Human sacrificeedit Main article Ancient Egyptian retainer sacrifices Human sacrifice was practiced as part of the funerary rituals associated with all of the pharaohs of the first dynasty. It is clearly demonstrated as existing during this dynasty by retainers being buried near each pharaohs tomb as well as animals sacrificed for the burial. The tomb of Djer is associated with the burials of 338 individuals.11 The people and animals sacrificed such as donkeys were expected to assist the pharaoh in the afterlife. For unknown reasons this practice ended with the conclusion of the dynasty. According to historian and linguist Christopher Ehret the ritual practice of retainer sacrifice originated from the southern region in the Middle Nile. Ehret also stated that this cultural practice was shared with the Kerma kingdom of the Upper Nubian Nile region.12 Rulersedit Known rulers in the history of Egypt for the First Dynasty are as follows Name Image Comments Dates Family Narmer Believed to be the same person as Menes and to have unified Upper and Lower Egypt.
