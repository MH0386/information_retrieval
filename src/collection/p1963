He was commonly known as Auletes  the Flautist referring to his love of playing the flute in Dionysian festivals. A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty he was a descendant of its founder Ptolemy I a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great.note 1 Ptolemy XII was an illegitimate son of Ptolemy IX by an uncertain mother. In 116 BC Ptolemy IX became coregent with his mother Cleopatra III. However he was forced into a civil war against his mother and his brother Ptolemy X leading to his exile in 107 BC. Cleopatra III sent her grandsons to Kos in 103 BC. They were captured by Mithridates VI of Pontus probably in 88 BC around the time Ptolemy IX returned to the Egyptian throne. After their father died in 81 BC Ptolemy XIIs halfsister Berenice III took the throne. She was soon murdered by her husband and coregent Ptolemy XI who was then killed. At this point Ptolemy XII was recalled from Pontus and proclaimed pharaoh while his brother also named Ptolemy was installed as king of Cyprus. Ptolemy XII married his relative Cleopatra V who was likely one of his sisters or cousins they had at least one child together Berenice IV and Cleopatra V was likely also the mother of his second daughter Cleopatra VII. The kings three youngest children  Arsinoe IV Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV  were born to an unknown mother. Ptolemy XIIs uncle Ptolemy X had left Egypt to Rome in the event there were no surviving heirs making Roman annexation of Egypt a possibility. In an effort to prevent this Ptolemy XII established an alliance with Rome late into his first reign. Rome annexed Cyprus in 58 BC causing Ptolemy of Cyprus to commit suicide. Shortly afterwards Ptolemy XII was deposed by the Egyptian people and fled to Rome and his eldest daughter Berenice IV took the throne. With Roman funding and military assistance Ptolemy XII recaptured Egypt and had Berenice IV killed in 55 BC. He named his daughter Cleopatra VII as his coregent in 52 BC. He died the next year and was succeeded by Cleopatra VII and her brother Ptolemy XIII as joint rulers. Background and early lifeedit Ptolemy IX Ptolemy XII was the oldest son of Ptolemy IX. The identity of his mother is uncertain. Ptolemy IX was married twice to his sister Cleopatra IV from around 119 BC until he was forced to divorce her in 115 BC and secondly to another sister Cleopatra Selene from 115 BC until he abandoned her during his flight from Alexandria in 107 BC. However Cicero and other ancient sources refer to Ptolemy XII as an illegitimate son Pompeius Trogus called him a nothos bastard while Pausanias wrote that Ptolemy IX had no legitimate sons at all.34 Some scholars have therefore proposed that his mother was a concubine  if so probably an Alexandrian Greek.56789 It had been speculated by Werner Hu that Ptolemys mother was an unknown woman belonging to the Egyptian elite based upon a speculated earlier marriage between Psenptais II high priest of Ptah and a certain Berenice once argued to possibly be a daughter of Ptolemy VIII.1011 However the speculation of this marriage was refuted by Egyptologist Wendy Cheshire.12
13 note 2 Chris Bennett argues that Ptolemy XIIs mother was Cleopatra IV and that he was considered illegitimate simply because she had never been coregent.14 This theory is endorsed by the historian Adrian Goldsworthy.15 The date of Ptolemy XIIs birth is thus uncertain.16 If he was the son of Cleopatra IV he was probably born around 117 BC and followed around a year later by a brother known as Ptolemy of Cyprus. In 117 BC Ptolemy IX was governor of Cyprus but in 116 BC he returned to Alexandria upon the death of his father Ptolemy VIII. At this point Ptolemy IX became the junior coregent of his grandmother Cleopatra II and his mother Cleopatra III. In 115 BC his mother forced him to divorce Cleopatra IV who fled into exile. The former Egyptian queen married the Seleucid king Antiochus IX but she was murdered by his halfbrother and rival Antiochus VIII in 112 BC.171819 Ptolemy IX meanwhile had been remarried to Cleopatra Selene with whom he had a daughter Berenice III.20 By 109 BC Ptolemy IX had begun the process of introducing Ptolemy XII to public life. In that year Ptolemy XII served as the Priest of Alexander and Ptolemaic kings an office which Ptolemy IX otherwise held himself throughout his reign and had a festival established in his honour in Cyrene.2122 Relations between Ptolemy IX and his mother deteriorated. In 107 BC she forced him to flee Alexandria for Cyprus and replaced him as coregent with his younger brother Ptolemy X.20 Justin mentions that Ptolemy IX left two sons behind when he fled Alexandria.23 Chris Bennett argues that these sons should be identified as Ptolemy XII and Ptolemy of Cyprus.14 Mithridates VI of Pontus Ptolemy IX made an attempt to reclaim the Ptolemaic throne in 103 BC by invading Judaea. At the start of this war Cleopatra III sent her grandsons to the island of Kos along with her treasure in order to protect them.2425 There Ptolemy XII and Ptolemy of Cyprus seem to have been captured by Mithridates VI of Pontus in 88 BC at the outbreak of the First Mithridatic War.2226 Ironically their father had reclaimed the Egyptian throne around the same time. They were held by Mithridates as hostages until 80 BC. At some point during this period probably in 81 or 80 BC they were engaged to two of Mithridates daughters Mithridatis and Nyssa.27 Meanwhile Ptolemy IX died in December 81 BC and was succeeded by Berenice III. In April 80 BC Ptolemy Xs son Ptolemy XI was installed as Berenice IIIs husband and coregent. He promptly murdered her and was himself killed by an angry Alexandrian mob. The Alexandrians then summoned Ptolemy XII to Egypt to assume the kingship his brother also named Ptolemy became king of Cyprus where he would reign until 58 BC.102829 First reign 8058 BCedit Egyptianstyle statue of Ptolemy XII found at the Temple of the Crocodile in Fayoum Egypt On his arrival in Alexandria in April 80 BC Ptolemy XII was proclaimed king. His reign was officially dated as having begun on the death of his father in 81 BC thereby eliding the reigns of Berenice III and Ptolemy XI. Shortly after his accession Ptolemy XII married one of his relatives Cleopatra V.30 Her parentage is uncertain  modern scholarship often interprets her as a sister30 but Christopher Bennett argues that she was a daughter of Ptolemy X.31 The couple became coregents and they were incorporated into the Ptolemaic dynastic cult together as the Theoi Philopatores kai Philadelphoi Fatherloving and Siblingloving Gods. This title was probably meant to reinforce Ptolemy XIIs claim to the throne in the face of claims that his parentage meant that he was an illegitimate son of Ptolemy IX and therefore not entitled to rule.30 A likely sculpture of Cleopatra V also known as Cleopatra VI 
1 st century BC from Lower Egypt now in the Muse SaintRaymond32 In 76 BC the High Priest of Ptah in Memphis died and Ptolemy XII travelled to Memphis to appoint his fourteenyearold son Pasherienptah III as the new High Priest. In turn Pasherienptah III crowned Ptolemy as Pharaoh and then went to Alexandria where he was appointed as Ptolemy XIIs prophet. These encounters are described in detail on Pasherienptahs funerary stela Stele BM 866 and they demonstrate the extremely close and mutually reinforcing relationship that had developed between the Ptolemaic kings and the Memphite priesthood by this date.30 In August 69 BC Cleopatra V ceases to be mentioned as coregent. The images of her that had been carved on the main pylon of the Temple of Horus at Edfu were covered over at this time. The reason for this sudden shift is unknown but presumably she was divorced at this time.30 Ptolemy adopted a new royal epithet Neos Dionysos New Dionysus at some time after this Chris Bennett proposes that the epithet was linked to the break with Cleopatra.22 Relations with Romeedit Relief of Ptolemy XII from the double temple at Kom Ombo Pompey Ptolemy XIIs key ally in Rome Temple which Ptolemy XII decorated with figures of himself smiting the enemy When Ptolemy X had died in 88 BC his will had left Egypt to Rome in the event that he had no surviving heirs. Although the Romans had not acted on this the possibility that they might forced the following Ptolemies to adopt a careful and respectful policy towards Rome.3334 Ptolemy XII continued this proRoman policy in order to protect himself and secure his dynastys fate. Egypt came under increasing Roman pressure nevertheless. In 65 BC the Roman censor Marcus Licinius Crassus proposed that Rome annex Egypt.35 This proposal failed in the face of opposition from Quintus Lutatius Catulus and Cicero. In light of this crisis however Ptolemy XII began to expend significant resources on bribing Roman politicians to support his interests. In 63 BC when Pompey was reorganising Syria and Anatolia following his victory in the Third Mithridatic War Ptolemy sought to form a relationship with Pompey by sending him a golden crown. Ptolemy also provided pay and maintenance for 8000 cavalry to Pompey for his war with Judaea. He also asked Pompey to come to Alexandria and help to put down a revolt which had apparently broken out in Egypt Pompey refused.363337 The money required for these bribes was enormous. Initially Ptolemy XII funded them by raising taxes. A strike by farmers of royal land in Herakleopolis which is attested in a papyrus document from 6160 BC has been interpreted as a sign of widespread discontent with this taxation. Increasingly Ptolemy XII also had recourse to loans from Roman bankers such as Gaius Rabirius Postumus. This gave the Romans even more leverage over his regime and meant that the fate of Egypt became an increasingly immediate issue in Roman politics.33 Finally in 60 BC Ptolemy XII travelled to Rome where the First Triumvirate composed of Pompey Crassus and Julius Caesar had just taken power in order to negotiate official recognition of his kingship. Ptolemy paid Pompey and Caesar six thousand talents  an enormous sum equivalent to the total annual revenue of Egypt.38 In return a formal alliance or foedus was formed. The Roman Senate recognised Ptolemy as king and Caesar passed a law that added Ptolemy to the list of friends and allies of the people of Rome amici et socii populi Romani in 59 BC.394041 In 58 BC the Romans took control of Cyprus causing its ruler Ptolemy XIIs brother to commit suicide.42 Ptolemy XII took no action in response to his brothers death and Cyprus remained a Roman province until returned to Ptolemaic control by Julius Caesar in 48 BC.43 Exile in Rome 5855 BCedit Further information Early life of Cleopatra The bribery policy had been unpopular in Egypt for a long time both because of its obsequiousness and because of the heavy tax burden that it entailed but the annexation of Cyprus demonstrated its failure and enraged the people of Alexandria. The courtiers in Alexandria forced Ptolemy to step down from the throne and leave Egypt.44 He was replaced by his daughter Berenice IV who ruled jointly with Cleopatra Tryphaena known to modern historians as Cleopatra VI who was probably Ptolemy XIIs former wife but may be an otherwise unattested daughter. Following Cleopatra Tryphaenas death a year later Berenice ruled alone from 57 to 56 BC.4543 A denarius of Pompey minted 4948 BC Probably taking his daughter Cleopatra VII with him Ptolemy fled for the safety of Rome.46474849 On the way he stopped in Rhodes where the exiled Cato the Younger offered him advice on how to approach the Roman aristocracy but no tangible support. In Rome Ptolemy XII prosecuted his restitution but met opposition from certain members of the Senate. His old ally Pompey housed the exiled king and his daughter and argued on behalf of Ptolemys restoration in the Senate.5043 During this time Roman creditors realized that they would not get the return on their loans to the king without his restoration.51 In 57 BC pressure from the Roman public forced the Senates decision to restore Ptolemy. However Rome did not wish to invade Egypt to restore the king since the Sibylline books stated that if an Egyptian king asked for help and Rome proceeded with military intervention great dangers and difficulties would occur.52 Egyptians heard rumours of Romes possible intervention and disliked the idea of their exiled kings return. The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that a group of one hundred men were sent as envoys from Egypt to make their case to the Romans against Ptolemy XIIs restoration. Ptolemy seemingly had their leader Dio of Alexandria poisoned and most of the other protesters killed before they reached Rome.53 Restoration and second reign 5551 BCedit Further information Early life of Cleopatra and Reign of Cleopatra Rare drachma of Ptolemy XII minted at Paphos Cyprus in 53 BC54 depicting him instead of Ptolemy I Roman bust of Cleopatra VII Altes Museum Antikensammlung Berlin In 55 BC Ptolemy paid Aulus Gabinius 10000 talents to invade Egypt and so recovered his throne. Gabinius defeated the Egyptian frontier forces marched to Alexandria and attacked the palace where the palace guards surrendered without fighting.55 The exact date of Ptolemy XIIs restoration is unknown the earliest possible date of restoration was 4 January 55 BC and the latest possible date was 24 June the same year. Upon regaining power Ptolemy acted against Berenice and along with her supporters she was executed. Ptolemy XII maintained his grip on power in Alexandria with the assistance of around two thousand Roman soldiers and mercenaries known as the Gabiniani. This arrangement enabled Rome to exert power over Ptolemy who ruled until he fell ill in 51 BC.56 On 31 May 52 BC his daughter Cleopatra VII was named as his coregent.57 At the moment of Ptolemy XIIs restoration Roman creditors demanded the repayment of their loans but the Alexandrian treasury could not repay the kings debt. Learning from previous mistakes Ptolemy XII shifted popular resentment of tax increases from himself to a Roman his main creditor Gaius Rabirius Postumus whom he appointed dioiketes minister of finance and so in charge of debt repayment. Perhaps Gabinius had also put pressure on Ptolemy XII to appoint Rabirius who now had direct access to the financial resources of Egypt but exploited the land too much. The king had to imprison Rabirius to protect his life from the angry people then allowed him to escape. Rabirius immediately left Egypt and went back to Rome at the end of 54 BC. There he was accused de repetundis but defended by Cicero and probably acquitted.5859 Ptolemy also permitted a debasing of the coinage as an attempt to repay the loans. Near the end of Ptolemys reign the value of Egyptian coinage dropped to about fifty per cent of its value at the beginning of his first reign.60 Ptolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC.61 His will stipulated that Cleopatra VII and her brother Ptolemy XIII should rule Egypt together. To safeguard his interests he made the people of Rome executors of his will. Since the Senate was busy with its own affairs his ally Pompey approved the will.62 Legacy and assessmentsedit Ptolemy XII before Hathor and Philae at the Hathor Temple Dendera which he built in 54 BC6364 Ptolemy XII before Isis and Osiris at the Hathor Temple Dendera6364 Generally descriptions of Ptolemy XII portray him as weak and selfindulgent drunk or a lover of music.65 According to Strabo his practice of playing the flute earned him the ridiculing sobriquet Auletes flute player Now all of the kings after the third Ptolemy being corrupted by luxurious living administered the affairs of government badly but worst of all were the fourth seventh and the last Auletes who apart from his general licentiousness practised the accompaniment of choruses with the flute and upon this he prided himself so much that he would not hesitate to celebrate contests in the royal palace and at these contests would come forward to vie with the opposing contestants. Strabo XVII 1 11 66 According to the author Mary SianiDavies Throughout his longlasting reign the principal aim of Ptolemy was to secure his hold on the Egyptian throne so as to eventually pass it to his heirs. To achieve this goal he was prepared to sacrifice much the loss of rich Ptolemaic lands most of his wealth and even according to Cicero the very dignity on which the mystique of kingship rested when he appeared before the Roman people as a mere supplicant. Mary SianiDavies Ptolemy XII Auletes and the Romans Historia 1997 62 Marriage and issueedit Ptolemy married his sister Cleopatra V who was with certainty the mother of his eldest known child Berenice IV.67 Cleopatra V disappears from court records a few months after the birth of Ptolemy XIIs second known child68 and probably hers Cleopatra VII in 69 BC.6970717273747576 The identity of the mother of the last three of Ptolemy XIIs children in birth order Arsinoe IV Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV is also uncertain. One hypothesis contends that possibly they and perhaps Cleopatra VII were Ptolemy XIIs children with a theoretical half Macedonian Greek half Egyptian woman belonging to a priestly family from Memphis in northern Egypt68 but this is only speculation.77 The philosopher Porphyry c. 234  c. 305 AD wrote of Ptolemy XIIs daughter Cleopatra VI who reigned alongside her sister Berenice IV.78 The Greek historian Strabo c. 63 BC  c. AD 24 stated that the king had only three daughters of whom the eldest has been referred to as Berenice IV.79 This suggests that the Cleopatra Tryphaena mentioned by Porphyry may not have been Ptolemy XIIs daughter but his wife. Many experts now identify Cleopatra VI with Cleopatra V.67 Name Image Birth Death Notes Berenice IV 7975 BC early 55 BC Queen of Egypt June 58 BC  early 55 BC80 Cleopatra VII December 70 BC or January 69 BC 12 August 30 BC Queen of Egypt 51  30 BC81 Arsinoe IV 6361 BC 41 BC Queen of Cyprus in 48 BC claimed queenship of Egypt from late 48 BC until expelled by Julius Caesar in early 47 BC82 Ptolemy XIII 6261 BC 13 January 47 BC Coregent with Cleopatra VII 51  47 BC83 Ptolemy XIV 6059 BC JuneSeptember 44 BC Coregent with Cleopatra VII 47  44 BC84 Referencesedit  Ptolemy XII Auletes  Macedonian king of Egypt  Britannica. www.britannica.com.
