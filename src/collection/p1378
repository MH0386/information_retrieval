27 present Condition Reconstructed Public access Limited The mortuary temple of Hatshepsut Egyptian srsrw meaning Holy of Holies is a mortuary temple built during the reign of Pharaoh Hatshepsut of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.b Located opposite the city of Luxor it is considered to be a masterpiece of ancient architecture.c Its three massive terraces rise above the desert floor and into the cliffs of Deir elBahari. Her tomb KV20 lies inside the same massif capped by El Qurn a pyramid for her mortuary complex. At the edge of the desert 1 km 
0.6 2 mi east connected to the complex by a causeway lies the accompanying valley temple. Across the river Nile the whole structure points towards the monumental Eighth Pylon Hatshepsuts most recognizable addition to the Temple of Karnak and the site from which the procession of the Beautiful Festival of the Valley departed. The temples twin functions are identified by its axes its main eastwest axis served to receive the barque of AmunRe at the climax of the festival while its northsouth axis represented the life cycle of the pharaoh from coronation to rebirth. Construction of the terraced temple took place between Hatshepsuts seventh and twentieth regnal year during which building plans were repeatedly modified. In its design it was heavily influenced by the adjacent Temple of Mentuhotep II of the Eleventh Dynasty built six centuries earlier.d In the arrangement of its chambers and sanctuaries though the temple is wholly unique. The main axis normally reserved for the mortuary complex is occupied instead by the sanctuary of the barque of AmunRe with the mortuary cult being displaced south to form the auxiliary axis with the solar cult complex to the north. Separated from the main sanctuary are shrines to Hathor and Anubis which lie on the middle terrace. The porticoes that front the terrace here host the most notable reliefs of the temple those of the expedition to the Land of Punt and of the divine birth of Hatshepsut the backbone of her case to rightfully occupy the throne as a member of the royal family and as godly progeny. Below the lowest terrace leads to the causeway and out to the valley temple. The state of the temple has suffered over time. Two decades after Hatshepsuts death under the direction of Thutmose III references to her rule were erased usurped or obliterated. The campaign was intense but brief quelled after two years when Amenhotep II was enthroned. The reasons behind the proscription remain a mystery. A personal grudge appears unlikely as Thutmose III had waited twenty years to act. Perhaps the concept of a female king was anathema to ancient Egyptian society or a dynastic dispute between the Ahmosid and Thutmosid lineages needed resolving. In the Amarna Period the temple was incurred upon again when Akhenaten ordered the images of Egyptian gods particularly those of Amun to be erased. These damages were repaired subsequently under Tutankhamun Horemheb and Ramesses II. An earthquake in the Third Intermediate Period caused further harm. During the Ptolemaic period the sanctuary of Amun was restructured and a new portico built at its entrance. A Coptic monastery of Saint Phoibammon was built between the 
6 th and 
8 th centuries AD and images of Christ were painted over original reliefs. The latest graffito left is dated to c.1223. The temple resurfaces in the records of the modern era in 1737 with Richard Pococke a British traveller who visited the site. Several visitations followed though serious excavation was not conducted until the 18
50 s and 
60 s under Auguste Mariette. The temple was fully excavated between 1893 and 1906 during an expedition of the Egypt Exploration Fund EEF directed by douard Naville. Further efforts were carried out by Herbert E. Winlock and the Metropolitan Museum of Art MMA from 1911 to 1936 and by mile Baraize and the Egyptian Antiquities Service now the Supreme Council of Antiquities SCA from 1925 to 1952. Since 1961 the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology PCMA has carried out extensive consolidation and restoration works throughout the temple and it was opened to the public in March 2023.

From her accession to the throne Hatshepsut renewed the act of monument building.17 The focal point of her attention was the city of Thebes and the god Amun by whom she legitimized her reign.101819 The preeminent residence of Amun was the Temple of Karnak20 to which Hatshepsut had contributed the Eighth Pylon two 
30.5  m 100 ft tall obelisks offering chapels a shrine with two further obelisks and statues of herself.1021 Facing Karnak from across the river Nile she built a mortuary temple against the cliffs of Deir elBahari.22 The pinnacle of her architectural contributions22 it is considered to be among the great architectural wonders of the ancient world.911 At its far eastern end lay a valley temple followed by a 1 km 
0.6 2 mi long 37 m 121 ft wide causeway which also hosted a barque station at its midpoint that led to the entrance gate of the mortuary temple.32324 Here three massive terraces rose above the desert floor24 and led into the DjeserDjeseru or Holy of Holies.1025 Nearly the entire temple was built of limestone with some red granite and sandstone.26 A single architrave was built of violet sandstone purportedly sourced from Mentuhotep IIs temple.27 This temple built centuries earlier and found immediately south of Hatshepsuts served as an inspiration for her design.28 On its main axis and at the end of temple lay the temples main cult site a shrine to AmunRe which received his barque each year during the Beautiful Festival of the Valley in May.293031 In the south were the offering halls of Thutmose I and Hatshepsut and to the north was the solar cult court.32 Outside two further shrines were built for Hathor and Anubis respectively.33 In total the temple comprised five cult sites.34 The identity of the architect behind the project remains unclear. It is possible that Senenmut the Overseer of Works or Hapuseneb the High Priest were responsible. It is also likely that Hatshepsut provided input to the project.10 Over the course of its construction between the seventh and twentieth year of Hatshepsuts reign the temple plan underwent several revisions.27 A clear example of these modifications is in the Hathor shrine whose expansions included among other things a conversion from a single to dual hypostyle halls.35 Its design was directly inspired by Mentuhotep IIs adjoining temple immediately south13 although its manner of arrangement is entirely unique.11 For example whilst the central shrine of Mentuhotep IIs temple was dedicated to his mortuary cult Hatshepsut instead elevated the shrine of Amun to greater prominence.3622 However her mortuary cult was otherwise afforded the most voluminous chamber in the temple harkening back to the offering halls of the pyramid age.36 There are parallels between the temples architectural style and contemporaneous Minoan architecture which has raised the possibility of an international style spreading across the Mediterranean in this period.1037 Hatshepsut may also be of partly Cretan descent.37 Overall the temple is representative of New Kingdom funerary architecture which served to laud the pharaoh and to honour gods relevant to the afterlife.38 Architectureedit Terracesedit Hatshepsuts expedition to Punt The opening feature of the temple is the three terraces fronted by a portico leading up to the temple proper and arrived at by a 1 km 
0.6 2 mi long causeway that led from the valley temple.27 Each elevated terrace was accessed by a ramp which bifurcated the porticoes.13 The lower terrace measures 120 m 390 ft deep by 75 m 246 ft wide and was enclosed by a wall with a single 2 m 
6.6  ft wide entrance gate at the centre of its east side. This terrace featured two Persea Mimusops schimperi trees two Tshaped basins which held papyri and flowers and two recumbent lion statues on the ramp balustrade.3940 The 25 m 82 ft wide porticoes of the lower terrace contain 22 columns each arranged in two rows4142 and feature relief scenes on their walls.2443 The south porticos reliefs depict the transportation of two obelisks from Elephantine to the Temple of Karnak in Thebes where Hatshepsut is presenting the obelisks and the temple to the god AmunRe. They also depict Dedwen Lord of Nubia43 and the Foundation Ritual.44 The north porticos reliefs depict Hatshepsut as a sphinx crushing her enemies along with images of fishing and hunting and offerings to the gods.4345 The outer ends of the porticoes hosted 
7.8  m 26 ft tall Osiride statues.4647 The middle terrace measures 75 m 246 ft deep by 90 m 300 ft wide fronted by porticoes on the west and partially on the north sides.4513 The west porticoes contain 22 columns arranged in two rows while the north portico contains 15 columns in a single row.41 The reliefs of the west porticoes of this terrace are the most notable from the mortuary temple. The southwest portico depicts the expedition to the Land of Punt and the transportation of exotic goods to Thebes. The northwest portico reliefs narrate the divine birth of Hatshepsut to Thutmose I represented as AmunRe and Ahmose. Thus legitimizing her rule both by royal lineage and godly progeny.4345 This is the oldest known scene of its type.48 Construction of the north portico and its four or five chapels was abandoned prior to completion and consequently it was left blank.4950 The terrace also likely featured sphinxes set up along the path to the next ramp45 whose balustrade was adorned by falcons resting upon coiled cobras.51 In the southwest and northwest corner of the terrace are the shrines to Hathor and Ra respectively.434541 The upper terrace opens to 26 columns each fronted by a 
5.2  m 17 ft tall Osiride statue of Hatshepsut.5213 They are split in the centre by a granite gate through which the festival courtyard was entered.5354 This division is represented geographically too as the southern colossi carry the Hedjet of Upper Egypt while the northern colossi bear the Pschent of Lower Egypt.54 The portico here completes the narrative of the preceding porticoes with the coronation of Hatshepsut as king of Upper and Lower Egypt.51 The courtyard is surrounded by pillars two rows deep on the north east and south sides and three rows deep on the west side.13 Eight smaller and ten larger niches were cut into the west wall these are presumed to have contained kneeling and standing statues of Pharaoh Hatshepsut.4045 The remaining walls are carved with reliefs the Beautiful Festival of the Valley on the north the Festival of Opet on the east and the coronation rituals on the south.3245 Three cult sites branch off from the courtyard.32 The sanctuary of Amun lies west on the main axis to the north was the solar cult court and to the south is a chapel dedicated to the mortuary cults of Hatshepsut and Thutmose I.5541 Remains of a Persea tree of the lower terrace Balustrade adorned with a Horus statue Punt portico of the middle terrace North portico of the middle terrace Osiride statues of Hatshepsut of the upper terrace Hathor shrineedit At the south end of the middle terrace is a shrine dedicated to the goddess Hathor.564345 The shrine is separated from the temple and is accessed by a ramp from the lower terrace although an alternative entrance existed at the upper terrace.475745 The ramp opens to a portico adorned with four columns carrying Hathor capitals.5653 The walls of the entrance contain scenes of Hathor being fed by Hatshepsut.58 Inside are two hypostyle halls the first containing 12 columns53 and the second containing 
16.4 5 Beyond this are a vestibule containing two columns and a double sanctuary.45 Reliefs on the walls of the shrine depict Hathor with Hatshepsut the goddess Werethekhau presenting the pharaoh with a Menat necklace and Senenmut.4553 Hathor holds special significance in Thebes representing the hills of Deir elBahari and also to Hatshepsut who presented herself as a reincarnation of the goddess.5643 Hathor is also associated with Punt which is the subject of reliefs in the proximate portico.43 The shrine to Hathor Entrance into the Hathor shrine Hathor capital columns Anubis shrineedit At the north end of the middle terrace is a shrine dedicated to the god Anubis.334345 This shrine is smaller than its counterpart to Hathor in the south.4353 It comprises a hypostyle hall adorned with 12 columns arranged into three rows of four followed by a sequence of two rooms terminating at a small niche.4556 Images presented on the walls are of offerings and cult activity with a relief showing Anubis escorting Hatshepsut to the shrine.45 The name of Anubis was used to designate the heir to the throne which the Egyptologist Ann Macy Roth associates to the reliefs depicting Hatshepsuts divine birth.43 The shrine to Anubis Anubis presented with bounteous offerings Sokaris Osiris presented with wine by Thutmose III Amun shrineedit Barque hall of the shrine to Amun Situated at the back of the temple on its main axis is the climactic point of the temple the sanctuary of Amun to whom Hatshepsut had dedicated the temple as a garden for my father Amun.342259 Inside the first chamber was a chapel which hosted the barque of Amun and a skylight that allowed light to flood onto the statue of Amun.3460 The lintel of the red granite entrance depicts two Amuns seated upon a throne with backs together and kings kneeling in submission before them a symbol of his supreme status in the sanctuary.61 Inside the hall are scenes of offerings presented by Hatshepsut and Thutmose I accompanied by Ahmose and Princesses Neferure and Nefrubity62 four Osiride statues of Hatshepsut in the corners63 and six statues of Amun occupying the niches of the hall.61 In the tympanum cartouches containing Hatshepsuts name are flanked and apotropaically guarded by those of AmunRe.64 This chamber was the end point of the annual Beautiful Festival of the Valley.65 The second chamber contained a cult image of Amun603462 and was flanked either side by a chapel.66 The north chapel was carved with reliefs depicting the gods of the Heliopolitan Ennead and the south chapel with the corresponding Theban Ennead. The enthroned gods each carried a wassceptre and an ankh. Presiding over the delegations Atum and Montu occupied the end walls.67 The third chamber contained a statue around which the Daily Ritual was also performed. It was originally believed to have been constructed a millennium after the original temple under Ptolemy VIII Euergetes giving it the name the Ptolemaic Sanctuary. The discovery of reliefs depicting Hatshepsut evidence the construction to her reign instead.68 The Egyptologist Dieter Arnold speculates that it might have hosted a granite false door.34 Solar cult courtedit Altar of the solar cult complex The solar cult is accessed from the courtyard through a vestibule occupied by three columns in the north side of the upper terrace courtyard.4556 The doorjamb of the entrance is embellished with the figures of Hatshepsut RaHorakhty Horus and Amun.62 The reliefs in the vestibule contain images of Thutmose I and Thutmose III.32 The vestibule opens to the main court which hosts a grand altar open to the sky and accessed from a staircase in the courts west.564558 There are two niches present in the court in the south and west wall the former shows RaHorakhty presenting an ankh to Hatshepsut and the latter contains a relief of Hatshepsut as a priest of her own cult.45 Attached to the court was a chapele which contained representations of Hatshepsuts family.30 In these Thutmose I and his mother Seniseneb are depicted giving offerings to Anubis while Hatshepsut and Ahmose are depicted giving offerings to AmunRe.32 Mortuary cult complexedit Situated in the south of the courtyard was the mortuary cult complex.36 Accessed through a vestibule adorned with three columns are two offering halls oriented on an eastwest axis.7032 The northern hall is dedicated to Thutmose I the southern hall is dedicated to Hatshepsut.70 Hatshepsuts offeringhall emulated those found in the mortuary temples of the Old and Middle Kingdom pyramid complexes. It measured 
13.2 5 m 
43.5  ft deep by 
5.2 5 m 
17.2  ft wide and had a vaulted ceiling 
6.3 5 m 
20.8  ft high.36 Consequently it was the largest chamber in the entire temple.71 Thutmose Is offeringhall was decidedly smaller measuring 
5.3 6 m 
17.6  ft deep by 
2.6 5 m 
8.7  ft wide.72 Both halls contained red granite false doors scenes of animalsacrifice offerings and offeringbearers priests performing rituals and the owner of the chapel seated before a table receiving those offerings.32 Scenes from the offeringhall are direct copies of those present in the Pyramid of Pepi II from the end of the Sixth Dynasty.71 Foundation depositsedit Prior to its construction the stretching of the cord otherwise known as the foundation ritual was performed.7344 The ritual is depicted in detail on the south portico of the lower terrace. The ceremony opens before the goddess Seshat it follows Hatshepsut and her ka scattering besen grains before she offers her temple to AmunRe. The next scene has been lost it preceded the closing scene of the Great Offering to AmunReKamutef.4474 During the ceremony the consecration of foundation deposits would take place44 a practice that started as early as the Third Dynasty of Egypt at the Pyramid of Djoser.73 There are sixteen known foundation deposits at Hatshepsuts temple that generally outline its perimeter and a further three at the valley temple.75 Broadly pottery votives food and ritual offerings tools scarabs and seal amulets were deposited into the prepared holes.7376 The titles of Hatshepsut Thutmose III and Neferure are incised into some of these items as are images and names of gods.73 Travertine vasesf and lidsg retrieved from a foundation deposit Scarab bearing the inscription mtkr nb twy meaning Lord of the Two Lands Maatkare Delicately inscribed hammering stoneh knot amuleti and mstyw adzej Functionedit Mortuary complexedit Entrance to the mortuary cult complex flanked by columns and the coronation ritual It has been suggested that Hatshepsuts tomb in the Valley of the Kings KV20 was meant to be an element of the mortuary complex at Deir elBahari.80 The arrangement of the temple and tomb bear a spatial resemblance to the pyramid complexes of the Old Kingdom8182 which comprised five central elements valley temple causeway mortuary temple main pyramid and cult pyramid.8384 Hatshepsuts temple complex included the valley temple causeway and mortuary temple. Her tomb was built into the massif of the same cliffs as the temple beneath the dominating peak of El Qurn 489 m 1604 ft AMSL11 that caps her tomb in a sense like the pyramid capped the tomb of an Old Kingdom pharaoh.85 Further her tomb lies inline with the offering hall of the mortuary cult complex.86 There is another analogous relationship that between the mortuary temple and Karnak and that of the pyramids and Heliopolis.87 Though KV20 is recognized as the tomb of Hatshepsut there is dispute over who commissioned its initial construction. Two competing hypotheses suggest that the tomb was built originally during the reign of either Thutmose I or Thutmose II and that Hatshepsut had the tomb altered later with an additional chamber for her own burial.80 The principal function of the temple was to serve the royal mortuary cults of Hatshepsut and Thutmose I.2234 To fulfill this purpose a mortuary cult complex was built where offerings could be made for the k or spirit of the king.34 In the Egyptian conception the deceased continued to rely on the same sustenance as the living. In life the aspects of the soul the k b and  were contained in the vessel of the living body. On death the body was rendered immobile and the soul was able to leave it.88 In her temple the offering of food and drink was performed before the granite false doors of the offering chapels.899032 The mortuary ritual lists of offerings and the recipient of the rites were depicted on the east wall of both chapels.32 Beautiful Festival of the Valleyedit Main article Beautiful Festival of the Valley A section of the Beautiful Festival of the Valley relief The sanctuary of Amun was the end point of the Beautiful Festival of the Valley conducted annually starting at the Temple of Karnak.65 This celebration dates to the Middle Kingdom when it concluded at the temple built by Mentuhotep II.9121 The procession began at the Eighth Pylon at Karnak led by Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III followed by noblemen and priests bearing Amuns barque accompanied by musicians dancers courtiers and more priests and guarded by soldiers.2291 A further flotilla of small boats and the great ship Userhat which carried the barque were towed.91 In Hatshepsuts time the barque of Amun was a miniaturized copy of a transport barge equipped with three long carryingpoles borne by six priests each.92 The figure of a rams head sacred to Amun adorned its prow and stern.9293 In the centre of its hull a lavishly ornamented naos was installed and the statue of Amun presently bejewelled cloistered within. The barque likely measured 
4.5  m 15 ft in length.92 The procession crossed the Nile visited the cemeteries in remembrance before landing at the valley temple to proceed along the 1 km 
0.6 2 mi long causeway to the temple proper.2234 Halfway up was the barque station beyond which the path was flanked by more than 100 sandstone sphinxes up to the terraces.3427 This is the oldest attested sphinx avenue though the practice is thought to date to the Old Kingdom.94 The valley temple and barque station were points at which offerings were made and purification rituals conducted.91 The procession carried on through the entrancegate up the temples great ramps and into the sanctuary where the barque and Amun were kept for a night before being returned home to Karnak.91 On this day bounteous offerings of food meat drink and flowers were presented on tables to Amun with smaller quantities reserved for the king.95 On all other days priests performed the Daily Ritual upon the statues of Amun and Hatshepsut.96 Daily ritualedit Before dawn each morning a pair of priests visited the temples well to collect water for transfer to libation vessels. Other priests busied themselves preparing food and drink as offerings to the gods while the head priest mnr visited the prdwt to be purified and clothed in preparation for the ceremony. The naos containing the cult image of AmunRe was first purified with incense. At first light the head priest opened the shrine and prostrated himself before the god declaring that he had been sent on behalf of the king while other priests performed recitations. The shrine was purified with water and incense and a statuette of Maat was presented to the cult image which was then removed. The statuette was declothed cleared of oil and placed on a pile of clean sand a representation of benben. Fresh paint was applied to its eyes it was anointed with various oils dressed in new garments of cloth and provided with accessories. Lastly its face was anointed and sand scattered around the chapel before the image was returned to its resting place. By now the gods breakfast offering was presented to him. A final set of purifications were conducted and the doors to the shrine closed with the head priest sweeping away his footsteps behind him. The food was taken away as well  they were not physically consumed the god only partook of their essence  to be represented at the chapels of other deities. Each god received essentially the same service. The food was eventually consumed by the priests in the reversion of offerings wb t. More purifying libations were poured and incense burned at the shrines at noon and in the evening. At other times hymns were sung apotropaic rituals performed to protect AmunRes barque as it voyaged across the sky and wax or clay images of enemies destroyed.9798 Later historyedit In ancient Egyptedit Proscription of Hatshepsut by Thutmose IIIedit Two decades after her death during Thutmose IIIs fortysecond regnal year he decided that all evidence of her reign as king of Egypt should be erased. His reasons for proscribing her reign remain unclear. This assault against her reign was however shortlived. Two years after it started when Amenhotep II ascended to the throne the proscription was abandoned and much of the erasure left halffinished.99 There are three hypotheses regarding Thutmose IIIs motivation. The oldest and most dubious is personal revenge. This hypothesis holds that Hatshepsut usurped the throne as sole ruler relegating Thutmose III and consequently he sought to erase her memory. This explanation is unconvincing as the proscription was delayed by two decades and targeted only against her reign as king.100101 The second argument is that it was a repudiation of the concept of female kingship. The role of a king was closed to women and her assumption of the role may have presented ideological problems that were resolved via erasure. This may explain the decision to leave images of her as queen intact.102103 The third case assesses the possibility of a dynastic dispute between the Ahmosid and Thutmosid lineages. By expunging her rule from the record Thutmose III may have ensured that his son Amenhotep II would ascend the throne.101 There is however no known Ahmosid pretender.102 Several methods of erasure were employed at her temple by Thutmose III in his campaign. The least damaging were the scratching out of feminine pronouns and suffixes which otherwise left the text intact. These were commonly used in the Hathor shrine and in the upper terrace. More thorough removal methods included chiselling away roughening smoothing patching or covering over of her image and titles. In other places her image was replaced with that of an offering table. Occasionally her image was repurposed for a member of the Thutmosid family. This was most often Thutmose II although infrequently instead her cartouche was replaced with that of Thutmose I or III.104 The final method and the most destructive was the obliteration of her statuary in the temple. Workmen dragged the statues from her temple to one of two designated sites a quarry  a burrow from which fill material was obtained  and the Hatshepsut Hole. Here sledgehammers and stone blocks were used to break up the statues which were then dumped into the chosen repositories.105 Statues of Hatshepsut were targeted for destruction during the proscription The severed head from a Hatshepsut statue Erasure of Hatshepsuts royal titulary leftk with Thutmose IIIs royal titulary rightl A column reinscribed with prnr Thutmose IIs throne name A broken column with a partial serekh bearing the signs for r and mr Amarna Period to Third Intermediate Periodedit Erasure of Amun right figure by order of Akhenaten The temple continued to serve as a site of worship following Thutmose IIIs death. During the Amarna Period further erasure of the reliefs was inflicted by order of Akhenaten albeit the target of this persecution were images of the gods particularly Amun.107 Early in his reign Aten a solar deity was elevated to the status of supreme god.108109 The persecution of other gods did not begin immediately instead reform proceeded gradually for several years before culminating in prohibition around his ninth regnal year. The proscription coincides with the ostracization of Horus.110111 These images were restored during the reigns of Tutankhamun Horemheb and Ramesses II.11292 The temple was damaged further by an earthquake in the ninth century BC during the Third Intermediate Period.107113 During this time between the TwentyFirst and TwentyFifth Dynasties the temple was used as a burial ground for priests of the cults of Amun and Montu as well as for members of the royal family.114 Ptolemaic eraedit Ptolemaic portico of the festival courtyard During the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes a stone chapel was built on the middle terrace for Asklepios a god of the Greek pantheon.10727 Later under Ptolemy VIII Euergetes the sanctuary of Amun was significantly altered. The cult statue chamber was converted into a chapel for Amenhotep son of Hapu the Eighteenth Dynasty architect of Amenhotep III Imhotep the Third Dynasty vizier of Djoser and Hygieia the Greek goddess of hygiene.115107 In the barque hall the two centre niches were filled and the skylight blocked.11563 The sanctuary entrance was outfitted with a portico carried by six columns.63107 Beyond ancient Egyptedit After the Ptolemaic kingdom the temple was used as a site of local worship. Between the 
6 th and 
8 th centuries AD a Coptic monastery of Saint Phoibammon was constructed on the temple grounds. Figures of Christ and other saints were painted over the original relief work with the temple. A pilgrim left the latest dated graffito in c.12
23.1 16 Archaeological excavationsedit The earliest modern visitor to the temple was Richard Pococke an English traveller in 1737. He was followed by Franois Jollois and Rene Edouard Devilliers two members of Napoleon Bonapartes expedition in 1798. The earliest archaeological findings were made around 1817 by Giovanni Battista Belzoni and Henry William Beechey who scavenged the site for artefacts to present to Henry Salt the British consul. Another visitor to the site in 18231825 Henry Westcar is credited with the earliest printed reference to the name Deir elBahari. In the following decades John Gardner Wilkinson JeanFranois Champollion and Karl Richard Lepsius each visited the site. The earliest significant excavations took place in the 18
50 s and 
60 s under Auguste Mariette. Under his supervision the remains of the monastery of Saint Phoibammon were destroyed and the shrines to Hathor and Anubis as well as the south colonnade of the middle terrace were revealed. During the Egypt Exploration Funds EEF expedition under douard Naville and his assistant Howard Carter from 18931906 the entire temple was excavated. The seven volumes of Navilles work form a fundamental source of information for the temple. In 19111936 the Metropolitan Museum of Art MMA funded excavation works under the direction of Herbert E. Winlock. In 19251952 a team led by mile Baraize for the Egyptian Antiquities Service reconstructed significant portions of the temple. Since 1961 the Polish Center of Mediterranean Archeology PCMA of Warsaw University in Cairo has been engaged in restoration and consolidation efforts at the site.11727 The PolishEgyptian Archaeological and Conservation Expedition was established by Kazimierz Michaowski after he was approached by the Supreme Council of Antiquities SCA. The project was originally constrained to reconstructing the third terrace but since 1967 the mission has included the entire temple. The project is presently directed by Patryk Chudzik.
