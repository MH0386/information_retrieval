He was the son of Darius the Great and Atossa a daughter of Cyrus the Great. In Western history Xerxes is best known for his invasion of Greece in 480 BC which ended in Persian defeat. Xerxes was designated successor by Darius over his elder brother Artobazan and inherited a large multiethnic empire upon his fathers death. He consolidated his power by crushing revolts in Egypt and Babylon and renewed his fathers campaign to subjugate Greece and punish Athens and its allies for their interference in the Ionian Revolt. In 480 BC Xerxes personally led a large army and crossed the Hellespont into Europe. He achieved victories at Thermopylae and Artemisium before capturing and razing Athens. His forces gained control of mainland Greece north of the Isthmus of Corinth until their defeat at the Battle of Salamis. Fearing that the Greeks might trap him in Europe Xerxes retreated with the greater part of his army back to Asia leaving behind Mardonius to continue his campaign. Mardonius was defeated at Plataea the following year effectively ending the Persian invasion. After returning to Persia Xerxes dedicated himself to largescale construction projects many of which had been left unfinished by his father. He oversaw the completion of the Gate of All Nations the Apadana and the Tachara at Persepolis and continued the construction of the Palace of Darius at Susa. He also maintained the Royal Road built by his father. In 465 BC Xerxes and his heir Darius were assassinated by Artabanus the commander of the royal bodyguard. He was succeeded by his third son who took the throne as Artaxerxes I. Etymologyedit Xrxs  is the Greek and Latin Xerxes Xerses transliteration of the Old Iranian Xaya ruling over heroes which can be seen by the first part xaya meaning ruling and the second  meaning hero man.4 The name of Xerxes was known in Akkadian as iiar and in Aramaic as yr.5 Xerxes would become a popular name among the rulers of the Achaemenid Empire.4 Early lifeedit Parentage and birthedit Xerxes father was Darius the Great r.522486 BC the incumbent monarch of the Achaemenid Empire albeit himself not a member of the family of Cyrus the Great the founder of the empire.67 Xerxes mother was Atossa a daughter of Cyrus.8 Darius and Atossa married in 522 BC9 and Xerxes was born around 518 BC.10 Upbringing and educationedit The Caylus vase a quadrilingual alabaster jar with cuneiform and hieroglyphic inscriptions in the name of Xerxes the Great King. Cabinet des Mdailles Paris11 According to the Greek dialogue First Alcibiades which describes typical upbringing and education of Persian princes they were raised by eunuchs. Starting at the age of seven they learned how to ride and hunt after reaching the age of fourteen they were each taught by four teachers from aristocratic backgrounds who taught them how to be wise just prudent and brave.12 Persian princes also learned the basics of the Zoroastrian religion and were taught to be truthful to be courageous and to have selfrestraint.12 The dialogue further added that fear for a Persian is the equivalent of slavery.12 At the age of 16 or 17 they began their mandatory 10 years of national service which included practicing archery and javelin competing for prizes and hunting.13 Afterwards they served in the military for around 25 years after which they were elevated to the status of elders and advisers to the king. Families13 in this time including Xerxes would intermarry. This account of education among the Persian elite is supported by Xenophons description of the 
5 thcentury BC Achaemenid prince Cyrus the Younger with whom he was wellacquainted.13 Stoneman suggests that this was the type of upbringing and education that Xerxes experienced.14 It is unknown if Xerxes ever learned to read or write with the Persians favoring oral history over written literature.14 Stoneman suggests that Xerxes upbringing and education was possibly not much different from that of the later Iranian kings such as Abbas the Great king of the Safavid Empire in the 
17 thcentury AD.14 Starting from 498 BC Xerxes resided in the royal palace of Babylon.15 Accession to the throneedit While Darius was preparing for another war against Greece a revolt began in Egypt in 486 BC due to heavy taxes and the deportation of craftsmen to build the royal palaces at Susa and Persepolis. The king was required by Persian law to choose a successor before setting out on dangerous expeditions when Darius decided to leave for Egypt 487486 BC he prepared his tomb at Naqshe Rustam five kilometers from his royal palace at Persepolis and appointed Xerxes his eldest son by Atossa as his successor. However Darius could not lead the campaign due to his failing health he died in October 486 BC at the age of 
64.1 6 Artobazan claimed that he should take the crown as the eldest of all Darius children while Xerxes argued for his own claim on the grounds that that he was the son of Atossa the daughter of Cyrus and that Cyrus had won the Persians their freedom. Xerxes claim was supported by a Spartan king in exile who was present in Persia at the time the Eurypontid king Demaratus who also argued that the eldest son did not universally have the best claim to the crown citing Spartan law which stated that the first son born while the father is king was the heir to the kingship.17 Some modern scholars also view the unusual decision of Darius to give the throne to Xerxes as a result of his consideration of the particular prestige that Cyrus the Great and his daughter Atossa enjoyed.18 Artobazan was born to Darius the subject while Xerxes was the eldest son born in the purple after Darius rise to the throne. Furthermore while Artobazans mother was a commoner Xerxes mother was the daughter of the founder of the Achaemenid Empire.19 Xerxes was crowned and succeeded his father in OctoberDecember 486 BC20 when he was about 32 years old.21 The transition of power to Xerxes was smooth due again in part to the great authority of Atossa2223 and his accession to royal power was not challenged by any person at court or in the Achaemenian family or by any subject nation.24 Consolidation of poweredit Engraving of Babylon by H. Fletcher 1690 At the time of Xerxes accession trouble was brewing in some of his domains. A revolt occurred in Egypt which seems dangerous enough for Xerxes to personally lead the army to restore order which also gave him the opportunity to begin his reign with a military campaign.25 Xerxes suppressed the revolt in January 484 BC and appointed his fullbrother Achaemenes as satrap of Egypt replacing the previous satrap Pherendates who was reportedly killed during the revolt.2615 The suppression of the Egyptian revolt expended the army which had been mobilized by Darius over the previous three years.25 Xerxes therefore had to raise another army for his expedition into Greece which took another four years.25 There was also unrest in Babylon which revolted at least twice against Xerxes during his reign. The first revolt broke out in June or July of 484 BC and was led by a rebel of the name Belshimanni. Belshimmanis revolt was shortlived Babylonian documents written during his reign only account for a period of two weeks.27 Two years later Babylon produced another rebel leader Shamasheriba. Beginning in the summer of 482 BC Shamasheriba seized Babylon itself and other nearby cities such as Borsippa and Dilbat and was only defeated in March 481 BC after a lengthy siege of Babylon.27 The precise cause of the unrest in Babylon is uncertain.25 It may have been due to tax increases.28 Prior to these revolts Babylon had occupied a special position within the Achaemenid Empire the Achaemenid kings had held the titles of King of Babylon and King of the Lands implying that they perceived Babylonia as a somewhat separate entity within their empire united with their own kingdom in a personal union. After the revolts however Xerxes dropped King of Babylon from his titulature and divided the previously large Babylonian satrapy accounting for most of the NeoBabylonian Empires territory into smaller subunits.29 Based on texts written by classical authors it is often assumed that Xerxes enacted a brutal vengeance on Babylon following the two revolts. According to ancient writers Xerxes destroyed Babylons fortifications and damaged the temples in the city.27 The Esagila was allegedly subject to great damage and Xerxes allegedly carried the statue of Marduk away from the city30 possibly bringing it to Iran and melting it down classical authors hold that the statue was made entirely of gold which would have made melting it down possible.27 Modern historian Amlie Kuhrt considers it unlikely that Xerxes destroyed the temples but believes that the story of him doing so may derive from an antiPersian sentiment among the Babylonians.31 It is doubtful if the statue was removed from Babylon at all27 and some have even suggested that Xerxes did remove a statue from the city but that this was the golden statue of a man rather than the statue of the god Marduk.3233 Though mentions of it are lacking considerably compared to earlier periods contemporary documents suggest that the Babylonian New Years Festival continued in some form during the Achaemenid period.34 Because the change in rulership from the Babylonians themselves to the Persians and due to the replacement of the citys elite families by Xerxes following its revolt it is possible that the festivals traditional rituals and events had changed considerably.35 Campaignsedit Invasion of the Greek mainlandedit Main article Second Persian invasion of Greece The soldiers of Xerxes I of all ethnicities36 on the tomb of Xerxes I at Naqshe Rostam3738 Darius died while in the process of preparing a second army to invade the Greek mainland leaving to his son the task of punishing the Athenians Naxians and Eretrians for their interference in the Ionian Revolt the burning of Sardis and their victory over the Persians at Marathon. From 483 BC Xerxes prepared his expedition The Xerxes Canal was dug through the isthmus of the peninsula of Mount Athos provisions were stored in the stations on the road through Thrace and two pontoon bridges later known as Xerxes Pontoon Bridges were built across the Hellespont. Soldiers of many nationalities served in the armies of Xerxes from all over his multiethnic massive Eurasiansized empire and beyond including the Assyrians Phoenicians Babylonians Egyptians Jews39 Macedonians European Thracians Paeonians Achaean Greeks Ionians Aegean islanders Aeolians Greeks from Pontus Colchians Sindhis and many more. According to the Greek historian Herodotus Xerxess first attempt to bridge the Hellespont ended in failure when a storm destroyed the flax and papyrus cables of the bridges. In retaliation Xerxes ordered the Hellespont the strait itself whipped three hundred times and had fetters thrown into the water. Xerxess second attempt to bridge the Hellespont was successful.40 The Carthaginian invasion of Sicily deprived Greece of the support of the powerful monarchs of Syracuse and Agrigentum ancient sources assume Xerxes was responsible modern scholarship is skeptical.41 Many smaller Greek states moreover took the side of the Persians especially Thessaly Thebes and Argos. Xerxes was victorious during the initial battles. Xerxes set out in the spring of 480 BC from Sardis with a fleet and army which Herodotus estimated was roughly one million strong along with 10000 elite warriors named the Immortals. More recent estimates place the Persian force at around 60000 combatants.42 Battle of Thermopylae and destruction of Athensedit Achaemenid king killing a Greek hoplite. Impression from a cylinder seal sculpted c. 500475 BC at the time of Xerxes I Metropolitan Museum of Art At the Battle of Thermopylae a small force of Greek warriors led by King Leonidas of Sparta resisted the much larger Persian forces but were ultimately defeated. According to Herodotus the Persians broke the Spartan phalanx after a Greek man called Ephialtes betrayed his country by telling the Persians of another pass around the mountains. At Artemisium large storms had destroyed ships from the Greek side and so the battle stopped prematurely as the Greeks received news of the defeat at Thermopylae and retreated. Foundations of the Old Temple of Athena destroyed by the armies of Xerxes I during the Destruction of Athens in 480 BC After Thermopylae Athens was captured. Most of the Athenians had abandoned the city and fled to the island of Salamis before Xerxes arrived. A small group attempted to defend the Athenian Acropolis but they were defeated. Xerxes ordered the Destruction of Athens and burnt the city leaving an archaeologically attested destruction layer known as the Perserschutt.43 The Persians thus gained control of all of mainland Greece to the north of the Isthmus of Corinth.3 Battles of Salamis and Plataeaedit Xerxes was induced by the message of Themistocles against the advice of Artemisia of Halicarnassus to attack the Greek fleet under unfavourable conditions rather than sending a part of his ships to the Peloponnesus and awaiting the dissolution of the Greek armies. The Battle of Salamis September 480 BC was won by the Greek fleet after which Xerxes set up a winter camp in Thessaly. According to Herodotus fearing that the Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe Xerxes decided to retreat back to Asia taking the greater part of the army with him.44 Another cause of the retreat might have been that the continued unrest in Babylon a key province of the empire required the kings personal attention.45 He left behind a contingent in Greece to finish the campaign under Mardonius who according to Herodotus had suggested the retreat in the first place. This force was defeated the following year at Plataea by the combined forces of the Greek city states ending the Persian offensive on Greece for good. Construction projectsedit The rockcut tomb at Naqshe Rustam north of Persepolis copying that of Darius is usually assumed to be that of Xerxes After his military blunders in Greece Xerxes returned to Persia and oversaw the completion of the many construction projects left unfinished by his father at Susa and Persepolis. He oversaw the building of the Gate of All Nations and the Hall of a Hundred Columns at Persepolis which are the largest and most imposing structures of the palace. He oversaw the completion of the Apadana the Tachara Palace of Darius and the Treasury all started by Darius as well as having his own palace built which was twice the size of his fathers. His taste in architecture was similar to that of Darius though on an even more gigantic scale.46 He had colorful enameled brick laid on the exterior face of the Apadana.47 He also maintained the Royal Road built by his father and completed the Susa Gate and built a palace in Susa.48 Death and successionedit This cuneiform text mentions the murder of Xerxes I by his son. From Babylon Iraq. British Museum In August 465 BC Artabanus the commander of the royal bodyguard and the most powerful official in the Persian court assassinated Xerxes with the help of a eunuch Aspamitres. Although the Hyrcanian Artabanus bore the same name as the famed uncle of Xerxes his rise to prominence was due to his popularity in religious quarters of the court and harem intrigues. He put his seven sons in key positions and had a plan to dethrone the Achaemenids.49 Greek historians give differing accounts of events. According to Ctesias in Persica 20 Artabanus then accused the Crown Prince Darius Xerxess eldest son of the murder and persuaded another of Xerxess sons Artaxerxes to avenge the patricide by killing Darius. But according to Aristotle in Politics 
5.1 3
11 b Artabanus killed Darius first and then killed Xerxes. After Artaxerxes discovered the murder he killed Artabanus and his sons.50 Participating in these intrigues was the general Megabyzus whose decision to switch sides probably saved the Achaemenids from losing their control of the Persian throne.51 Religionedit While there is no general consensus in scholarship as to whether Xerxes and his predecessors had been influenced by Zoroastrianism52 it is well established that Xerxes was a firm believer in Ahura Mazda whom he saw as the supreme deity.52 However Ahura Mazda was also worshipped by adherents of the IndoIranian religious tradition.5253 On his treatment of other religions Xerxes followed the same policy as his predecessors he appealed to local religious scholars made sacrifices to local deities and destroyed temples in cities and countries that caused disorder.54 Wives and childrenedit Xerxes being designated by Darius I.

Xerxes is a central character of Aeschylus play The Persians first performed in Athens in 472 BC only seven years after his invasion of Greece. The play presents him as an effeminate figure and his hubristic effort to bring both Asia and Europe under his control leads to the ruin of both himself and his kingdom.57 Herodotus Histories written later in the fifth century BC centre on the Persian Wars and Xerxes is a major figure. Some of Herodotus information is spurious.5859 Pierre Briant has accused him of presenting a stereotyped and biased portrayal of the Persians.60 Richard Stoneman regards his portrayal of Xerxes as nuanced and tragic compared to the vilification that he suffered at the hands of the Macedonian king Alexander the Great r.336323 BC.61 Xerxes is identified with the king Ahasuerus in the biblical Book of Esther62 which some scholars including Eduard Schwartz William Rainey Harper and Michael V. Fox consider to be historical romance.6364 There is nothing close to a consensus however as to what historical event provided the basis for the story.65666768 Xerxes is the protagonist of the opera Serse by the GermanEnglish Baroque composer George Frideric Handel. It was first performed in the Kings Theatre London on 15 April 1738. The famous aria Ombra mai f opens the opera. The murder of Xerxes by Artabanus Artabano execution of crown prince Darius Dario revolt by Megabyzus Megabise and subsequent succession of Artaxerxes I is romanticised by the Italian poet Metastasio in his opera libretto Artaserse 1730 which was first set to music by Leonardo Vinci and subsequently by other composers such as Johann Adolf Hasse and Johann Christian Bach.697071 The historical novel Xerxes of de Hoogmoed 1919 by Dutch writer Louis Couperus describes the Persian wars from the perspective of Xerxes. Though the account is fictionalised Couperus nevertheless based himself on an extensive study of Herodotus. The English translation Arrogance The Conquests of Xerxes by Frederick H. Martens appeared in 19
30.7 273 The Persian king in the Biblical Book of Esther is commonly thought to be Xerxes Later generations fascination with ancient Sparta particularly the Battle of Thermopylae has led to Xerxes portrayal in works of popular culture. He was played by David Farrar in the film The 300 Spartans 1962 where he is portrayed as a cruel powercrazed despot and an inept commander. He also features prominently in the graphic novels 300 and Xerxes The Fall of the House of Darius and the Rise of Alexander by Frank Miller as well as the film adaptation 300 2007 and its sequel 300 Rise of an Empire 2014 as portrayed by Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro in which he is represented as a giant man with androgynous qualities who claims to be a godking. This portrayal attracted controversy especially in Iran.74 Ken Davitian plays Xerxes in Meet the Spartans a parody of the first 300 movie replete with sophomoric humour and deliberate anachronisms. Similarly a highly satirized depiction of Xerxes based on his portrayal in 300 appears in the South Park episode DYikes Other works dealing with the Persian Empire or the Biblical story of Esther have also featured or alluded to Xerxes such as the video game Assassins Creed Odyssey and the film One Night with the King 2006 in which Ahasuerus Xerxes was portrayed by British actor Luke Goss. He is the leader of the Persian Empire in the video game Civilization II and III along with Scheherazade although Civilization IV replaces him with Cyrus the Great and Darius I.citation needed In the Age of Empires Xerxes featured as a short swordsman. Xerxes Ahasuerus by Ernest Normand 1888 detail Gore Vidal in his historical fiction novel Creation 1981 describes at length the rise of the Achaemenids especially Darius I and presents the life and death circumstances of Xerxes. Vidals version of the Persian Wars which diverges from the orthodoxy of the Greek histories is told through the invented character of Cyrus Spitama a halfGreek halfPersian and grandson of the prophet Zoroaster. Thanks to his family connection Cyrus is brought up in the Persian court after the murder of Zoroaster becoming the boyhood friend of Xerxes and later a diplomat who is sent to India and later to Greece and who is thereby able to gain privileged access to many leading historical figures of the period.75 Xerxes Ahasuerus is portrayed by Richard Egan in the 1960 film Esther and the King and by Joel Smallbone in the 2013 film The Book of Esther. In at least one of these films the events of the Book of Esther are depicted as taking place upon Xerxes return from Greece.citation needed Xerxes plays an important background role never making an appearance in two short works of alternate history taking place generations after his complete victory over Greece. These are Counting Potsherds by Harry Turtledove in his anthology Departures and The Craft of War by Lois Tilton in Alternate Generals volume 1 edited by Turtledove.citation needed See alsoedit List of biblical figures identified in extrabiblical sources Notesedit  Old Persian  Xayr also Khshayrsha2 Greek  Xrxs Referencesedit  Jrgen von Beckerath 1999.
