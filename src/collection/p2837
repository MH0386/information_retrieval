17 th Dynasty Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf I was a pharaoh of Egypt during the 
17 th Dynasty in the Second Intermediate Period. Attestationsedit Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf I is known from several monuments. Medamudedit He extensively restored and decorated the Temple of Monthu at Medamud where a fine high relief of this king making an offering before the gods has survived.1 Sobekemsaf I offering wine at the Temple of Monthu at Medamud. A sandstone column of this king has survived into the modern era. Abydosedit Sobekemsaf Is son similarly named Sobekemsaf after his father is attested in Cairo Statue CG 386 from Abydos which depicts this young prince prominently standing between his fathers legs in a way suggesting that he was his fathers chosen successor.2 Denderahedit At Denderah he is known for a stela mentioning his wife daughter and soninlaw.3 Sobekemsafs chief wife was Queen Nubemhat she and their daughter Sobekemheb are known from a stela of Sobekemhebs husband a kings son Ameni son of kings wife Haankhes. It is speculated that his unnamed father might have been SekhemreHeruhirmaat Intef or possibly Senakhtenre Ahmose.4 Wadi Hammamatedit Wadi Hammamat is a road from the Nile River near Koptos to Quseir on the Red Sea coast. Sobekemsaf I is attested by a series of inscriptions mentioning a mining expedition to the rock quarries at Wadi Hammamat in the Eastern Desert during his reign. One of the inscriptions is explicitly dated to his Year 
7.5  A heart scarab naming a certain king Sobekemsaf is generally assigned to him and is today located in the British Museum. It is believed to have been looted from his tomb in the 
19 th century. Theoriesedit Position within the 
17 th dynastyedit After the Intef kingsedit A red granite statue of Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf British Museum 1. Relief of Sobekemsaf I at the Temple of Monthu Medamud. Sobekemsaf Is sandstone columns and architrave Aidan Dodson dates Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsafs reign after those of Djehuti and SekhemreWepmaat Intef. First he remarks that Sobekemsafs canopic chest is slightly larger
4.1  cm longer and 
3.4  cm higherthan the canopic chests belonging to the latter two kings. He also points to the fact that the inscriptions on Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsafs box were written vertically rather than in the horizontal arrangement found on those of Djehuti and Sekhemre Wepmaet Intef.6 The Danish Egyptologist Kim Ryholt similarly dated Sobekemsaf Is reign after those of SekhmreWepmaat Intef and Nubkheperre Intef. First he remarked that a kings son Antefmose or Intefmose is praised by a king Sobekemsaf for his role during a festival of Sokar on statuette BM EA 133
29.7 89 But according to Ryholt in any case the name Antefmose is basilophorous and so the king Sobekemsaf who praised him must have been a successor of the Intef kings to one of whom the name Antefmose refers.10 Furthermore since Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf Is son and presumable successor was also named Sobekemsaf rather than Intef Ryholt concluded that this king must have ruled after the Intef kings.11 Secondly Ryholt suggested that Sobekemsaf Wadjkaw ruled after Nubkheperre Intef because while the former ruler carried out extensive restoration works at the temple of Monthu at Medamud there is no trace of Nubkheperre Intef there. For Ryholt this may suggest that this temple was restored and put into service again only after Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf reign.12 Consequently Ryholt concluded that Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf ruled after Nubkheperre Intef and should be numbered as Sobekemsaf II. Before the Intef kingsedit At the opposite end Daniel Polz who rediscovered Nubkheperre Intefs tomb at Dra Abu el Naga in 2001 argues that Nubkheperre Intef ruled very late in the 
17 th dynasty. This means that Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf could not have reigned between the Intef line of kings and the final three 
17 th dynasty Ahmoside family of kings Senakhtenre Seqenenre and Kamose. From inscriptions found on a doorjamb discovered in the remains of a 
17 th Dynasty temple at Gebel Antef on the LuxorFarshut road it is known today that Nubkheperre Intef and by implication his brother and immediate predecessor on the throne SekhemreWepmaat Intef were sons of one of the two Sobekemsaf kings. This king was most likely Sekhemre Shedtawy Sobekemsaf II since Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsafs son was also named Sobekemsaf.13 Ryholts interpretation of the lineage here has also been accepted by the British Egyptologist Aidan Dodson.14 Polz also accepts this view but he placed Nubkheperre Intef just prior to the three final Ahmoside kings of the 
17 th dynasty in his 2003 book.15 Since then he has inserted SekhemreHeruhirmaat Intef as a shortlived successor of Nubkheperre before Senakhtenre but his hypothesis remains essentially the same16 Polz maintains that Sekemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf I was the father of Sekhemre Shedtawy Sobekemsaf. Indeed this kings son is known from the statue at Abydos to have also held the name Sobekemsaf and is designated as this kings successor on the same statue.17 Polz states that this is the most plausible reconstruction of the relationship between the two kings with the name Sobekemsaf in the 
17 th dynasty.18 Hence Sekhemre Shedtawy Sobekemsaf would be Sobekemsaf II Sobekemsaf Is son and successor while SekhemreWepmaat Intef and Nubkheperre Intef would be grandsons of Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf I. This ultimately implies that Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf ruled early in the 
17 th dynasty before the Intef kings and that he must be numbered Sobekemsaf I. Polzs hypothesis and placement of Nubkheperre Intef as one of the last kings in the SobekemsafIntef family line is also supported by the evidence of the box of Minemhat who was governor of Coptos in Year 3 of Nubkheperre Intef.19 This box was part of the funerary equipment of an Hornakht formerly known as Aqhor in the past literature who lived under Seqenenre.20 While no one knows precisely when Hornakht died the fact that his funerary equipment contained a box which belonged to Minemhat suggests that Nubkheperre Intef and Seqenenre Tao ruled closely in time and that their reigns should not be separated by the intrusion of various other long lived kings of the 
17 th dynasty such as Sekhemre Wajdkhaw Sobekemsaf I who is attested by a Year 7 inscription. As the late Middle Kingdom German Egyptologist Detlef Franke 19522007 succinctly wrote in a journal article which was published in 20
08 a year after his death Contrary to Ryholt I see no place for a king Sobekemsaf who ruled after Nubkheperra Antef. Nubkheperra Antef c.1560 BC is the best attested from Abydos to Edfu e.g. BM 631 EA 1645 coffin 6652 and the most important of the three Antefs.21 In addition Polz argued that Ryholts rejection of the evidence in Cairo Statue CG 3
86 which named king Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsafs son as another Sobekemsafin not giving any indication of the sequence of the known 
17 th dynasty Theban rulers is untenable.22 While Ryholt acknowledges in his 1997 book on the Second Intermediate Period that Anthony Spalinger suggested the prince Sobekemsaf who is attested in a statue from Abydos Cairo CG 386 and has the additional title of prophet may be identical with Sobkemsaf II Sekhemreshedtawy23 Ryholt simply writes that this identification is not possible with the i.e. my present arrangement of the two Sobkemsaf kings according to which one Sobkemsaf Sekhemreshedtawy ruled before to the Antef group of kings and the other Sekhemrewadjkhaw after them.24 Polz notes that although Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf ruled in a time during the Second Intermediate Period when few documentary sources exist one cannot simply accept Ryholts theory that Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf Is son and designated successor did not succeed his own father as the next king merely because Ryholts hypothesis did not allow another Sobekemsaf to follow Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf on the throne due to his theory of the succession of 
17 th dynasty kings as being SekhemreShedtawy SobekemsafSekhemreWepmaat IntefNubkheperre IntefSekhemreHeruhirmaat IntefSekhemre Wadjkhaw SobekemsafSenakhtenreetc.2526 Indeed Polz stresses rather that it is more logical to view Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf I as a predecessor of the Intef line of kings instead his known son the Prince Sobekemsaf on Cairo Statue CG 386 would then be the future king Sekhemre Shedtawy Sobekemsaf II and father of two of the three Intef kings SekhemreWepmaat Intef and Nubkheperre Intef based on a doorjamb found on the LuxorFarsut road in 19929327 the doorjamb mentions a king Sobekemsaf as the father of Nubkheperre IntefNubkheperre AntefIntef begotten of Sobekem...but this king must be king Sobekemsaf II since Sobekemsaf Wadjkhaw Sobekemsafs son was named Sobekemsaf based on Cairo Statue CG 3
86.2 8 Sobekemsaf Is heart scarab today in the British Museum. Polzs critique of Ryholts view on Intefmoseedit Daniel Polz also rejected Ryholts arguments that the praise which a certain king Sobekemsaf lavished onto a kings son named Antefmose or Intefmose on statuette BM EA 13329 has any chronological implications regarding the temporal position of this king after the Intef kings. Polz writes that Ryholts socalled Point 3 is implicitly assuming that persons with the name Intef formed on the name of two or three kings of that name at the time of the 
17 th Dynasty can be related yet this completely ignores the fact that these kings themselves chose their own names in conscious style of the same kings of the early 
11 th dynasty  including even assuming additional names such as the Great as in the case of Wepmaat Intef. Ryholts argument on this point do not make sense. Even if one assumes that the prince named Intefmose followed one of the Intef 
17 th Dynasty kings and he was hence a contemporary of the successor of this Intef ruler this is but an interpretation that the Prince was honoured at the statue of a ruling king Sobekemsaf  only then would Ryholts argument with regards to the 
17 th Dynasty ruler sequence prove meaningful. In contrast if the Intefmose statuette and therefore the Prince was chronologically younger than the Intefkings and a successor of king Sobekemsaf was recognized a worship of the prince by a king Sobekemsaf says nothing about the temporal position of the latter pharaoh and thus of the succession of the 
17 th dynasty rulers of that time.29 Burialedit The burial equipment of Sobekemsaf Wadjkhaw does not contain his prenomen or royal name but can nevertheless be assigned with certainty to this king since the tomb of Sobekemsaf Shedtawy ie. Sobekemsaf II was thoroughly robbed in antiquity and set on fire by tomb robbers as recorded in Papyrus Abbott III 17. Sobekemsaf I Wadjkhaw was likely buried in Dra Abu elNaga and his tomb was only found and looted in the late 
19 th century. On this basis Kim Ryholt assigns a large heartscarab which was and indeed still is set in a large gold mount containing the name of Sobekemsaf to Sekhemre Wadjkhau Sobekemsaf I here since the tomb robbers would not overlook such a large object on the mummy of the king if it came from Sobekemsaf IIs tomb. For much the same reason a wooden canopic chest also bearing the name Sobekemsaf on it has also been attributed to this king by Ryholt and Aidan Dodson. In contrast to the extensive damage that might have been expected had the chest been in the burned and looted tomb of Sobekemsaf II the damage suffered by Cat. 26 i.e. Sobekemsaf Is chest is minor consistent with what it might have suffered at the hands of Qurnawi dealers.
