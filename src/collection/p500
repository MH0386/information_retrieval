Egypt Arabic  Mir mesr Egyptian Arabic pronunciation msr officially the Arab Republic of Egypt is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and the Sinai Peninsula in the southwest corner of Asia. It is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north the Gaza Strip of Palestine and Israel to the northeast the Red Sea to the east Sudan to the south and Libya to the west. The Gulf of Aqaba in the northeast separates Egypt from Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Cairo is the capital and largest city of Egypt while Alexandria the secondlargest city is an important industrial and tourist hub at the Mediterranean coast.21 At approximately 100 million inhabitants Egypt is the 
14 thmost populated country in the world and the thirdmost populated in Africa. Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country tracing its heritage along the Nile Delta back to the 
6 th
4 th millennia BCE. Considered a cradle of civilisation Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of writing agriculture urbanisation organised religion and central government.22 Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity but largely adopted Islam in the seventh century. Cairo became the capital of the Fatimid Caliphate in the tenth century and of the Mamluk Sultanate in the 
13 th century. Egypt then became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517 before its local ruler Muhammad Ali established it as an autonomous Khedivate in 1867. The country was then occupied by the British Empire and gained independence in 1922 as a monarchy. Following the 1952 revolution Egypt declared itself a republic and in 1958 it merged with Syria to form the United Arab Republic which was dissolved in 1961. Egypt fought several armed conflicts with Israel in 1948 1956 1967 and 1973 and occupyed the Gaza Strip intermittently until 1967. In 1978 Egypt signed the Camp David Accords which recognised Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from the Sinai. After the Arab Spring which led to the 2011 Egyptian revolution and overthrow of Hosni Mubarak the country faced a protracted period of political unrest this included the election in 2012 of a brief shortlived Muslim Brotherhoodaligned Islamist government spearheaded by Mohamed Morsi and its subsequent overthrow after mass protests in 2013. Egypts current government a semipresidential republic led by president Abdel Fattah elSisi since he was elected in 2014 has been described by a number of watchdogs as authoritarian and responsible for perpetuating the countrys poor human rights record. Islam is the official religion of Egypt and Arabic is its official language.1 The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River an area of about 40000 square kilometres 15000 sq mi where the only arable land is found. The large regions of the Sahara desert which constitute most of Egypts territory are sparsely inhabited. About 43 of Egypts residents live across the countrys urban areas23 with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta. Egypt is considered to be a regional power in North Africa the Middle East and the Muslim world and a middle power worldwide.24 It is a developing country having a diversified economy which is the largest in Africa the 
38 thlargest economy by nominal GDP and 1
27 th by nominal GDP per capita.25 Egypt is a founding member of the United Nations the NonAligned Movement the Arab League the African Union Organisation of Islamic Cooperation World Youth Forum and a member of BRICS. Names The English name Egypt is derived from the Ancient Greek Agyptos  via Middle French Egypte and Latin Aegyptus. It is reflected in early Greek Linear B tablets as akupitiyo.26 The adjective aigptiaigptios was borrowed into Coptic as gyptios and from there into Arabic as qub back formed into  qub whence English Copt. Some scholars suggest that the Greek forms were borrowed from Late Egyptian Amarna Hikuptah or Memphis a corruption of the earlier Egyptian name wtkpt     meaning home of the ka soul of Ptah the name of a temple to the god Ptah at Memphis.citation needed Mir  Arabic pronunciation mis  is the Classical Quranic Arabic and modern official name of Egypt while Mar  Egyptian Arabic pronunciation ms  is the local pronunciation in Egyptian Arabic27 with the full official name being Jumhryat Mir alArabyah and Gomhoreyyet Mar elArabeyya in Standard and Egyptian Arabic respectively. The name is of Semitic origin directly cognate with other Semitic words for Egypt such as the Hebrew   MiryimMitzryimMizrim. The oldest attestation of this name for Egypt is the Akkadian miiru miru2829 related to mirumiirrumiaru meaning border or frontier.30 The NeoAssyrian Empire used the derived term  Muur.31 The ancient Egyptian name of the country was    km.t which means black land likely referring to the fertile black soils of the Nile flood plains distinct from the deshret dt or red land of the desert.3233 This name is commonly vocalised as Kemet but was probably pronounced kumat in ancient Egyptian.34 The name is realised as Khm Bohairic Coptic  Sahidic Coptic  in the Coptic stage of the Egyptian language and appeared in early Greek as  Khma.3536 Another name was tmry land of the riverbank.37 The names of Upper and Lower Egypt were TaShemeaw tmw sedgeland and TaMehew t mw northland respectively.

In the 
10 th millennium BCE a culture of huntergatherers and fishers was replaced by a graingrinding culture. Climate changes or overgrazing around 8000 BCE began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt forming the Sahara. Early tribal peoples migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled agricultural economy and more centralised society.38 By about 6000 BCE a Neolithic culture took root in the Nile Valley.39 During the Neolithic era several predynastic cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt. The Badarian culture and the successor Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to dynastic Egypt. The earliest known Lower Egyptian site Merimda predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years. Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years remaining culturally distinct but maintaining frequent contact through trade. The earliest known evidence of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels dated to about 3200 BCE.40 The Giza Necropolis is the oldest of the ancient Wonders and the only one still in existence. A unified kingdom was founded c.3150 BCE by King Menes leading to a series of dynasties that ruled Egypt for the next three millennia. Egyptian culture flourished during this long period and remained distinctively Egyptian in its religion arts language and customs. The first two ruling dynasties of a unified Egypt set the stage for the Old Kingdom period c.27002200 BCE which constructed many pyramids most notably the Third Dynasty pyramid of Djoser and the Fourth Dynasty Giza pyramids. The First Intermediate Period ushered in a time of political upheaval for about 150 years.41 Stronger Nile floods and stabilisation of government however brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the Middle Kingdom c.2040 BCE reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III. A second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt that of the Semitic Hyksos. The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BCE and founded a new capital at Avaris. They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by Ahmose I who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty and relocated the capital from Memphis to Thebes. The New Kingdom c.15501070 BCE began with the Eighteenth Dynasty marking the rise of Egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as Tombos in Nubia and included parts of the Levant in the east. This period is noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs including Hatshepsut Thutmose III Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti Tutankhamun and Ramesses II. The first historically attested expression of monotheism came during this period as Atenism. Frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the New Kingdom. The country was later invaded and conquered by Libyans Nubians and Assyrians but native Egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country.42 The Weighing of the Heart from the Book of the Dead of Ani In 525 BCE the Achaemenid Empire led by Cambyses II began their conquest of Egypt eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the battle of Pelusium. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh but ruled Egypt from his home of Susa in Persia modern Iran leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy. The entire Twentyseventh Dynasty of Egypt from 525 to 402 BCE save for Petubastis III was an entirely Achaemenidruled period with the Achaemenid emperors all being granted the title of pharaoh. A few temporarily successful revolts against the Achaemenids marked the fifth century BCE but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Achaemenids.43 The Thirtieth Dynasty was the last native ruling dynasty during the Pharaonic epoch. It fell to the Achaemenids again in 343 BCE after the last native Pharaoh King Nectanebo II was defeated in battle. This Thirtyfirst Dynasty of Egypt however did not last long as the Achaemenids were toppled several decades later by Alexander the Great. The Macedonian Greek general of Alexander Ptolemy I Soter founded the Ptolemaic dynasty.44 Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt Main articles Ptolemaic Kingdom and Roman Egypt The Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII and her son by Julius Caesar Caesarion at the Temple of Dendera The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state extending from southern Syria in the east to Cyrene to the west and south to the frontier with Nubia. Alexandria became the capital city and a centre of Greek culture and trade. To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs. The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress and participated in Egyptian religious life.4546 The last ruler from the Ptolemaic line was Cleopatra VII who committed suicide following the burial of her lover Mark Antony after Octavian had captured Alexandria and her mercenary forces had fled. The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome. Christianity was brought to Egypt by Saint Mark the Evangelist in the 
1 st century.47 Diocletians reign 284305 CE marked the transition from the Roman to the Byzantine era in Egypt when a great number of Egyptian Christians were persecuted. The New Testament had by then been translated into Egyptian. After the Council of Chalcedon in CE 451 a distinct Egyptian Coptic Church was firmly established.48 Middle Ages 
7 th century  1517 Main article Egypt in the Middle Ages The Amr ibn alAs mosque in Cairo recognised as the oldest in Africa The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Sasanid Persian invasion early in the 
7 th century amidst the ByzantineSasanian War of 602628 during which they established a new shortlived province for ten years known as Sasanian Egypt until 63942 when Egypt was invaded and conquered by the Islamic caliphate by the Muslim Arabs. When they defeated the Byzantine armies in Egypt the Arabs brought Islam to the country. Some time during this period Egyptians began to blend in their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices leading to various Sufi orders that have flourished to this day.47 These earlier rites had survived the period of Coptic Christianity.49 In 639 an army were sent in Egypt by the second caliph Umar under the command of Amr ibn alAs. They defeated a Roman army at the battle of Heliopolis. Amr next proceeded in the direction of Alexandria which surrendered to him by a treaty signed on 8 November 641. Alexandria was regained for the Byzantine Empire in 645 but was retaken by Amr in 646. In 654 an invasion fleet sent by Constans II was repulsed. The Arabs founded the capital of Egypt called Fustat which was later burned down during the Crusades. Cairo was later built in the year 986 to grow to become the largest and richest city in the Arab caliphate second only to Baghdad. Abbasid period The Ibn Tulun Mosque in Cairo of Ahmad Ibn Tulun The Abbasid period was marked by new taxations and the Copts revolted again in the fourth year of Abbasid rule. At the beginning of the 
9 th century the practice of ruling Egypt through a governor was resumed under Abdallah ibn Tahir who decided to reside at Baghdad sending a deputy to Egypt to govern for him. In 828 another Egyptian revolt broke out and in 831 the Copts joined with native Muslims against the government. Eventually the power loss of the Abbasids in Baghdad led for general upon general to take over rule of Egypt yet being under Abbasid allegiance the Tulunid dynasty 868905 and Ikhshidid dynasty 935969 were among the most successful to defy the Abbasid Caliph. Fatimids Ayyubids and Mamluks The AlHakim Mosque in Cairo of AlHakim biAmr Allah the sixth caliph as renovated by Dawoodi Bohra Muslim rulers remained in control of Egypt for the next six centuries with Cairo as the seat of the Fatimid Caliphate. With the end of the Ayyubid dynasty the Mamluks a TurcoCircassian military caste took control about 1250. By the late 
13 th century Egypt linked the Red Sea India Malaya and East Indies.50 The mid
14 thcentury Black Death killed about 40 of the countrys population.51 Early modern period Ottoman Egypt 15171867 Main article Egypt Eyalet Napoleon defeated the Mamluk troops in the Battle of the Pyramids 21 July 1798 painted by Lejeune. Egypt was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1517 after which it became a province of the Ottoman Empire. The defensive militarisation damaged its civil society and economic institutions.50 The weakening of the economic system combined with the effects of plague left Egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion. Portuguese traders took over their trade.50 Between 1687 and 1731 Egypt experienced six famines.52 The 1784 famine cost it roughly onesixth of its population.53 Egypt was always a difficult province for the Ottoman Sultans to control due in part to the continuing power and influence of the Mamluks the Egyptian military caste who had ruled the country for centuries. Egypt remained semiautonomous under the Mamluks until it was invaded by the French forces of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798. After the French were defeated by the British a threeway power struggle ensued between the Ottoman Turks Egyptian Mamluks who had ruled Egypt for centuries and Albanian mercenaries in the service of the Ottomans. Muhammad Ali dynasty Main article History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty Egypt under Muhammad Ali dynasty Muhammad Ali was the founder of the Muhammad Ali dynasty and the first Khedive of Egypt and Sudan. After the French were expelled power was seized in 1805 by Muhammad Ali Pasha an Albanian military commander of the Ottoman army in Egypt. Muhammad Ali massacred the Mamluks and established a dynasty that was to rule Egypt until the revolution of 1952. The introduction in 1820 of longstaple cotton transformed its agriculture into a cashcrop monoculture before the end of the century concentrating land ownership and shifting production towards international markets.54 Muhammad Ali annexed Northern Sudan 18201824 Syria 1833 and parts of Arabia and Anatolia but in 1841 the European powers fearful lest he topple the Ottoman Empire itself forced him to return most of his conquests to the Ottomans. His military ambition required him to modernise the country he built industries a system of canals for irrigation and transport and reformed the civil service.54 He constructed a military state with around four percent of the populace serving the army to raise Egypt to a powerful positioning in the Ottoman Empire in a way showing various similarities to the Soviet strategies without communism conducted in the 
20 th century.55 Muhammad Ali Pasha evolved the military from one that convened under the tradition of the corve to a great modernised army. He introduced conscription of the male peasantry in 
19 th century Egypt and took a novel approach to create his great army strengthening it with numbers and in skill. Education and training of the new soldiers became mandatory the new concepts were furthermore enforced by isolation. The men were held in barracks to avoid distraction of their growth as a military unit to be reckoned with. The resentment for the military way of life eventually faded from the men and a new ideology took hold one of nationalism and pride. It was with the help of this newly reborn martial unit that Muhammad Ali imposed his rule over Egypt.56 The policy that Mohammad Ali Pasha followed during his reign explains partly why the numeracy in Egypt compared to other NorthAfrican and MiddleEastern countries increased only at a remarkably small rate as investment in further education only took place in the military and industrial sector.57 Muhammad Ali was succeeded briefly by his son Ibrahim in September 1848 then by a grandson Abbas I in November 1848 then by Said in 1854 and Ismail in 1863 who encouraged science and agriculture and banned slavery in Egypt.55 Khedivate of Egypt 18671914 Main article Khedivate of Egypt Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty remained nominally an Ottoman province. It was granted the status of an autonomous vassal state or Khedivate in 1867. The Suez Canal built in partnership with the French was completed in 1869. Its construction was financed by European banks. Large sums also went to patronage and corruption. New taxes caused popular discontent. In 1875 Ismail avoided bankruptcy by selling all Egypts shares in the canal to the British government. Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French controllers who sat in the Egyptian cabinet and with the financial power of the bondholders behind them were the real power in the Government.58 Other circumstances like epidemic diseases cattle disease in the 18
80 s floods and wars drove the economic downturn and increased Egypts dependency on foreign debt even further.59 The battle of Tel elKebir in 1882 during the AngloEgyptian War Local dissatisfaction with the Khedive and with European intrusion led to the formation of the first nationalist groupings in 1879 with Ahmed Urabi a prominent figure. After increasing tensions and nationalist revolts the United Kingdom invaded Egypt in 1882 crushing the Egyptian army at the Battle of Tell El Kebir and militarily occupying the country.60 Following this the Khedivate became a de facto British protectorate under nominal Ottoman sovereignty.61 In 1899 the AngloEgyptian Condominium Agreement was signed the Agreement stated that Sudan would be jointly governed by the Khedivate of Egypt and the United Kingdom. However actual control of Sudan was in British hands only. In 1906 the Denshawai incident prompted many neutral Egyptians to join the nationalist movement. Sultanate of Egypt 19141922 Main article Sultanate of Egypt Female nationalists demonstrating in Cairo 1919 In 1914 the Ottoman Empire entered World War I in alliance with the Central Empires Khedive Abbas II who had grown increasingly hostile to the British in preceding years decided to support the motherland in war. Following such decision the British forcibly removed him from power and replaced him with his brother Hussein Kamel.6263 Hussein Kamel declared Egypts independence from the Ottoman Empire assuming the title of Sultan of Egypt. Shortly following independence Egypt was declared a protectorate of the United Kingdom. After World War I Saad Zaghlul and the Wafd Party led the Egyptian nationalist movement to a majority at the local Legislative Assembly. When the British exiled Zaghlul and his associates to Malta on 8 March 1919 the country arose in its first modern revolution. The revolt led the UK government to issue a unilateral declaration of Egypts independence on 22 February 19
22.6 4 Kingdom of Egypt 19221953 Main article Kingdom of Egypt Fuad I of Egypt with Edward Prince of Wales 1932 Following independence from the United Kingdom Sultan Fuad I assumed the title of King of Egypt despite being nominally independent the Kingdom was still under British military occupation and the UK still had great influence over the state. British infantry near El Alamein 17 July 1942 The new government drafted and implemented a constitution in 1923 based on a parliamentary system. The nationalist Wafd Party won a landslide victory in the 19231924 election and Saad Zaghloul was appointed as the new Prime Minister. In 1936 the AngloEgyptian Treaty was concluded and British troops withdrew from Egypt except for the Suez Canal. The treaty did not resolve the question of Sudan which under the terms of the existing AngloEgyptian Condominium Agreement of 1899 stated that Sudan should be jointly governed by Egypt and Britain but with real power remaining in British hands.65 Britain used Egypt as a base for Allied operations throughout the region especially the battles in North Africa against Italy and Germany. Its highest priorities were control of the Eastern Mediterranean and especially keeping the Suez Canal open for merchant ships and for military connections with India and Australia. When the war began in September 1939 Egypt declared martial law and broke off diplomatic relations with Germany. It broke diplomatic relations with Italy in 1940 but never declared war even when the Italian army invaded Egypt. The Egyptian army did no fighting. In June 1940 the King dismissed Prime Minister Aly Maher who got on poorly with the British. A new coalition Government was formed with the Independent Hassan Pasha Sabri as Prime Minister. Following a ministerial crisis in February 1942 the ambassador Sir Miles Lampson pressed Farouk to have a Wafd or Wafdcoalition government replace Hussein Sirri Pashas government. On the night of 4 February 1942 British troops and tanks surrounded Abdeen Palace in Cairo and Lampson presented Farouk with an ultimatum. Farouk capitulated and Nahhas formed a government shortly thereafter. Most British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947 although the British army maintained a military base in the area but nationalist antiBritish feelings continued to grow after the War. Antimonarchy sentiments further increased following the disastrous performance of the Kingdom in the First ArabIsraeli War. The 1950 election saw a landslide victory of the nationalist Wafd Party and the King was forced to appoint Mostafa ElNahas as new Prime Minister. In 1951 Egypt unilaterally withdrew from the AngloEgyptian Treaty of 1936 and ordered all remaining British troops to leave the Suez Canal. As the British refused to leave their base around the Suez Canal the Egyptian government cut off the water and refused to allow food into the Suez Canal base announced a boycott of British goods forbade Egyptian workers from entering the base and sponsored guerrilla attacks. On 24 January 1952 Egyptian guerrillas staged a fierce attack on the British forces around the Suez Canal during which the Egyptian Auxiliary Police were observed helping the guerrillas. In response on 25 January General George Erskine sent out British tanks and infantry to surround the auxiliary police station in Ismailia. The police commander called the Interior Minister Fouad Serageddin Nahass righthand man to ask if he should surrender or fight. Serageddin ordered the police to fight to the last man and the last bullet. The resulting battle saw the police station levelled and 43 Egyptian policemen killed together with 3 British soldiers. The Ismailia incident outraged Egypt. The next day 26 January 1952 was Black Saturday as the antiBritish riot was known that saw much of downtown Cairo which the Khedive Ismail the Magnificent had rebuilt in the style of Paris burned down. Farouk blamed the Wafd for the Black Saturday riot and dismissed Nahas as prime minister the next day. He was replaced by Aly Maher Pasha.66 On 2223 July 1952 the Free Officers Movement led by Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser launched a coup dtat Egyptian Revolution of 1952 against the king. Farouk I abdicated the throne to his son Fouad II who was at the time a sevenmonthold baby. The Royal Family left Egypt some days later and the Council of Regency led by Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim was formed The council however held only nominal authority and the real power was actually in the hands of the Revolutionary Command Council led by Naguib and Nasser. Popular expectations for immediate reforms led to the workers riots in Kafr Dawar on 12 August 1952. Following a brief experiment with civilian rule the Free Officers abrogated the monarchy and the 1923 constitution and declared Egypt a republic on 18 June 1953. Naguib was proclaimed as president while Nasser was appointed as the new Prime Minister. Republic of Egypt 19531958 Main article History of republican Egypt Following the 1952 Revolution by the Free Officers Movement the rule of Egypt passed to military hands and all political parties were banned. On 18 June 1953 the Egyptian Republic was declared with General Muhammad Naguib as the first President of the Republic serving in that capacity for a little under one and a half years.

After Naguibs resignation the position of President was vacant until the election of Nasser in 19
56.6 7 In October 1954 Egypt and the United Kingdom agreed to abolish the AngloEgyptian Condominium Agreement of 1899 and grant Sudan independence the agreement came into force on 1 January 1956. Nasser assumed power as president in June 1956. British forces completed their withdrawal from the occupied Suez Canal Zone on 13 June 1956. He nationalised the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956 his hostile approach towards Israel and economic nationalism prompted the beginning of the Second ArabIsraeli War Suez Crisis in which Israel with support from France and the United Kingdom occupied the Sinai peninsula and the Canal. The war came to an end because of US and USSR diplomatic intervention and the status quo was restored. United Arab Republic 19581971 Smoke rises from oil tanks beside the Suez Canal hit during the initial AngloFrench assault on Egypt 5 November 1956. In 1958 Egypt and Syria formed a sovereign union known as the United Arab Republic. The union was shortlived ending in 1961 when Syria seceded thus ending the union. During most of its existence the United Arab Republic was also in a loose confederation with North Yemen or the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen known as the United Arab States. In the early 19
60 s Egypt became fully involved in the North Yemen Civil War. Despite several military moves and peace conferences the war sank into a stalemate.68 In mid May 1967 the Soviet Union issued warnings to Nasser of an impending Israeli attack on Syria. Although the chief of staff Mohamed Fawzi verified them as baseless6970 Nasser took three successive steps that made the war virtually inevitable on 14 May he deployed his troops in Sinai near the border with Israel on 19 May he expelled the UN peacekeepers stationed in the Sinai Peninsula border with Israel and on 23 May he closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping.71 On 26 May Nasser declared The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel.72 This prompted the beginning of the Third Arab Israeli War SixDay War in which Israel attacked Egypt and occupied Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip which Egypt had occupied since the 1948 ArabIsraeli War. During the 1967 war an Emergency Law was enacted and remained in effect until 2012 with the exception of an 
18 month break in 1980
81.7 3 Under this law police powers were extended constitutional rights suspended and censorship legalised.74 At the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 19
50 s less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor.75 Fewer than half of all primaryschoolage children attended school most of them being boys. Nassers policies changed this. Land reform and distribution the dramatic growth in university education and government support to national industries greatly improved social mobility and flattened the social curve. From academic year 195354 through 196566 overall public school enrolments more than doubled. Millions of previously poor Egyptians through education and jobs in the public sector joined the middle class. Doctors engineers teachers lawyers journalists constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser.75 During the 19
60 s the Egyptian economy went from sluggish to the verge of collapse the society became less free and Nassers appeal waned considerably.76 Arab Republic of Egypt 19
71 present President Sadat 19701981 Egyptian tanks advancing in the Sinai desert during the Yom Kippur War 1973 In 1970 President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat. Sadat switched Egypts Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States expelling Soviet advisors in 1972. He launched the Infitah economic reform policy while clamping down on religious and secular opposition. In 1973 Egypt along with Syria launched the Fourth ArabIsraeli War Yom Kippur War a surprise attack to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier. Celebrating the signing of the 1978 Camp David Accords Menachem Begin Jimmy Carter Anwar Sadat In 1975 Sadat shifted Nassers economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his programme of Infitah. Through this policy incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction abandoning Egypts infant industries.77 Because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs it led to the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots. Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in 1977 which led to the 1979 EgyptIsrael peace treaty in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. In return Egypt recognised Israel as a legitimate sovereign state. Sadats initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypts expulsion from the Arab League but it was supported by most Egyptians.78 Sadat was assassinated by an Islamic extremist in October 1981. President Mubarak 19812011 Hosni Mubarak was the president of Egypt from 1981 until his overthrew in 2011 Hosni Mubarak came to power after the assassination of Sadat in a referendum in which he was the only candidate.79 Hosni Mubarak reaffirmed Egypts relationship with Israel yet eased the tensions with Egypts Arab neighbours. Domestically Mubarak faced serious problems. Mass poverty and unemployment led rural families to stream into cities like Cairo where they ended up in crowded slums barely managing to survive. On 25 February 1986 the Security Police started rioting protesting against reports that their term of duty was to be extended from 3 to 4 years. Hotels nightclubs restaurants and casinos were attacked in Cairo and there were riots in other cities. A day time curfew was imposed. It took the army 3 days to restore order. 107 people were killed.80 Cairo grew into a metropolitan area with a population of over 20 million. In the 19
80 s 19
90 s and 20
00 s terrorist attacks in Egypt became numerous and severe and began to target Christian Copts foreign tourists and government officials.81 In the 19
90 s an Islamist group AlGamaa alIslamiyya engaged in an extended campaign of violence from the murders and attempted murders of prominent writers and intellectuals to the repeated targeting of tourists and foreigners. Serious damage was done to the largest sector of Egypts economytourism
82 and in turn to the government but it also devastated the livelihoods of many of the people on whom the group depended for support.83 During Mubaraks reign the political scene was dominated by the National Democratic Party which was created by Sadat in 1978. It passed the 1993 Syndicates Law 1995 Press Law and 1999 Nongovernmental Associations Law which hampered freedoms of association and expression by imposing new regulations and draconian penalties on violations.84 As a result by the late 19
90 s parliamentary politics had become virtually irrelevant and alternative avenues for political expression were curtailed as well.85 On 17 November 1997 62 people mostly tourists were massacred near Luxor. In late February 2005 Mubarak announced a reform of the presidential election law paving the way for multicandidate polls for the first time since the 1952 movement.86 However the new law placed restrictions on the candidates and led to Mubaraks easy reelection victory.87 Voter turnout was less than 
25.8 8 Election observers also alleged government interference in the election process.89 After the election Mubarak imprisoned Ayman Nour the runnerup.90 Human Rights Watchs 2006 report on Egypt detailed serious human rights violations including routine torture arbitrary detentions and trials before military and state security courts.91 In 2007 Amnesty International released a report alleging that Egypt had become an international centre for torture where other nations send suspects for interrogation often as part of the War on Terror.92 Egypts foreign ministry quickly issued a rebuttal to this report.93 Constitutional changes voted on 19 March 2007 prohibited parties from using religion as a basis for political activity allowed the drafting of a new antiterrorism law authorised broad police powers of arrest and surveillance and gave the president power to dissolve parliament and end judicial election monitoring.94 In 2009 Dr. Ali El Deen Hilal Dessouki Media Secretary of the National Democratic Party NDP described Egypt as a pharaonic political system and democracy as a longterm goal. Dessouki also stated that the real center of power in Egypt is the military.citation needed Revolution 2011 Main article 2011 Egyptian revolution Top celebrations in Tahrir Square after the announcement of Hosni Mubaraks resignation.

11.1 01 On 28 November 2011 Egypt held its first parliamentary election since the previous regime had been in power. Turnout was high and there were no reports of major irregularities or violence.102 President Morsi 20122013 Mohamed Morsi was elected president on 24 June 20
12.1 03 On 30 June 2012 Mohamed Morsi was sworn in as Egypts president.104 On 2 August 2012 Egypts Prime Minister Hisham Qandil announced his 
35 member cabinet comprising 28 newcomers including four from the Muslim Brotherhood.105 Liberal and secular groups walked out of the constituent assembly because they believed that it would impose strict Islamic practices while Muslim Brotherhood backers threw their support behind Morsi.106 On 22 November 2012 President Morsi issued a temporary declaration immunising his decrees from challenge and seeking to protect the work of the constituent assembly.107 The move led to massive protests and violent action throughout Egypt.108 On 5 December 2012 tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of President Morsi clashed in what was described as the largest violent battle between Islamists and their foes since the countrys revolution.109 Mohamed Morsi offered a national dialogue with opposition leaders but refused to cancel the December 2012 constitutional referendum.110 Political crisis 2013 Main article 2013 Egyptian coup dtat On 3 July 2013 after a wave of public discontent with autocratic excesses of Morsis Muslim Brotherhood government111 the military removed Morsi from office dissolved the Shura Council and installed a temporary interim government.112 On 4 July 2013 
68 yearold Chief Justice of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt Adly Mansour was sworn in as acting president over the new government following the removal of Morsi.113 The new Egyptian authorities cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters jailing thousands and forcefully dispersing proMorsi and proBrotherhood protests.114115 Many of the Muslim Brotherhood leaders and activists have either been sentenced to death or life imprisonment in a series of mass trials.116117118 On 18 January 2014 the interim government instituted a new constitution following a referendum approved by an overwhelming majority of voters

14.1 23 The Muslim Brotherhood and some liberal and secular activist groups boycotted the vote.124 Even though the interim authorities extended voting to a third day the 46 turnout was lower than the 52 turnout in the 2012 election.125 A new parliamentary election was held in December 2015 resulting in a landslide victory for proSisi parties which secured a strong majority in the newly formed House of Representatives.126 In 2016 Egypt entered in a diplomatic crisis with Italy following the murder of researcher Giulio Regeni in April 2016 Prime Minister Matteo Renzi recalled the Italian ambassador from Cairo because of lack of cooperation from the Egyptian Government in the investigation.127 The ambassador was sent back to Egypt in 2017 by the new Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.128 ElSisi was reelected in 2018 facing no serious opposition.129 In 2019 a series of constitutional amendments were approved by the parliament further increasing the Presidents and the militarys power increasing presidential terms from 4 years to 6 years and allowing incumbent president ElSisi to run for an additional third term.130 The proposals were approved in a referendum.131 The dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam escalated in 20

12.1 37 Geography Main article Geography of Egypt Egypts topography Egypt lies primarily between latitudes 22 and 
32 N and longitudes 25 and 
35 E. At 1001450 square kilometres 386660 sq mi it is the worlds 
30 thlargest country.138 Due to the extreme aridity of Egypts climate population centres are concentrated along the narrow Nile Valley and Delta meaning that about 99 of the population uses about 
5.5  of the total land area.139 98 of Egyptians live on 3 of the territory.140 Egypt is bordered by Libya to the west the Sudan to the south and the Gaza Strip and Israel to the east. A transcontinental nation it possesses a land bridge the Isthmus of Suez between Africa and Asia traversed by a navigable waterway the Suez Canal that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Indian Ocean by way of the Red Sea. Egypt is the eighth most water stressed country in the world. Apart from the Nile Valley the majority of Egypts landscape is desert with a few oases scattered about. Winds create prolific sand dunes that peak at more than 30 metres 100 ft high. Egypt includes parts of the Sahara desert and of the Libyan Desert. Sinai peninsula hosts the highest mountain in Egypt Mount Catherine at 2642 metres. The Red Sea Riviera on the east of the peninsula is renowned for its wealth of coral reefs and marine life. Towns and cities include Alexandria the second largest city Aswan Asyut Cairo the modern Egyptian capital and largest city El Mahalla El Kubra Giza the site of the Pyramid of Khufu Hurghada Luxor Kom Ombo Port Safaga Port Said Sharm El Sheikh Suez where the south end of the Suez Canal is located Zagazig and Minya. Oases include Bahariya Dakhla Farafra Kharga and Siwa. Protectorates include Ras Mohamed National Park Zaranik Protectorate and Siwa. On 13 March 2015 plans for a proposed new capital of Egypt were announced.141 Climate Main article Climate of Egypt The Qattara Depression in Egypts north west Most of Egypts rain falls in the winter months.142 South of Cairo rainfall averages only around 2 to 5 mm 
0.1  to 
0.2  in per year and at intervals of many years. On a very thin strip of the northern coast the rainfall can be as high as 410 mm 
16.1  in143 mostly between October and March. Snow falls on Sinais mountains and some of the north coastal cities such as Damietta Baltim and Sidi Barrani and rarely in Alexandria. A very small amount of snow fell on Cairo on 13 December 2013 the first time in many decades.144 Frost is also known in midSinai and midEgypt. Egypt has an unusually hot sunny and dry climate. Average high temperatures are high in the north but very to extremely high in the rest of the country during summer. The cooler Mediterranean winds consistently blow over the northern sea coast which helps to get more moderated temperatures especially at the height of the summertime. The Khamaseen is a hot dry wind that originates from the vast deserts in the south and blows in the spring or in the early summer. It brings scorching sand and dust particles and usually brings daytime temperatures over 40 C 104 F and sometimes over 50 C 122 F in the interior while the relative humidity can drop to 5 or even less. Prior to the construction of the Aswan Dam the Nile flooded annually replenishing Egypts soil. This gave Egypt a consistent harvest throughout the years. The potential rise in sea levels due to global warming could threaten Egypts densely populated coastal strip and have grave consequences for the countrys economy agriculture and industry. Combined with growing demographic pressures a significant rise in sea levels could turn millions of Egyptians into environmental refugees by the end of the 
21 st century according to some climate experts.145146 Biodiversity Main article Wildlife of Egypt The Eastern Imperial Eagle is the national animal of Egypt. Egypt signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 9 June 1992 and became a party to the convention on 2 June 19
94.1 47 It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan which was received by the convention on 31 July 19
98.1 48 Where many CBD National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans neglect biological kingdoms apart from animals and plants149 The plan stated that the following numbers of species of different groups had been recorded from Egypt algae 1483 species animals about 15000 species of which more than 10000 were insects fungi more than 627 species monera 319 species plants 2426 species protozoans 371 species. For some major groups for example lichenforming fungi and nematode worms the number was not known. Apart from small and wellstudied groups like amphibians birds fish mammals and reptiles the many of those numbers are likely to increase as further species are recorded from Egypt. For the fungi including lichenforming species for example subsequent work has shown that over 2200 species have been recorded from Egypt and the final figure of all fungi actually occurring in the country is expected to be much higher.150 For the grasses 284 native and naturalised species have been identified and recorded in Egypt.151 Government Main article Politics of Egypt Abdel Fattah elSisi is the current President of Egypt. The House of Representatives whose members are elected to serve fiveyear terms specialises in legislation. Elections were held between November 2011 and January 2012 which were later dissolved. The next parliamentary election was announced to be held within 6 months of the constitutions ratification on 18 January 2014 and were held in two phases from 17 October to 2 December 20
15.1 52 Originally the parliament was to be formed before the president was elected but interim president Adly Mansour pushed the date.153 The 2014 Egyptian presidential election took place on 2628 May. Official figures showed a turnout of 25578233 or 
47.5  with Abdel Fattah elSisi winning with 
23.7 8 million votes or 
96.9  compared to 757511

A 
50 member constitution committee was formed for modifying the constitution which was later published for public voting and was adopted on 18 January 20
14.1 55 In 2024 as part of its Freedom in the World report Freedom House rated political rights in Egypt at 6 with 40 representing the most free and 0 the least and civil liberties at 12 with 60 being the highest score and 0 the lowest which gave it the freedom rating of Not Free.156 According to the 2023 VDem Democracy indices Egypt is the eighth least democratic country in Africa.157 The 2023 edition of The Economist Democracy Index categorises Egypt as an authoritarian regime with a score of 
2.9 
3.1 58 Egyptian nationalism predates its Arab counterpart by many decades having roots in the 
19 th century and becoming the dominant mode of expression of Egyptian anticolonial activists and intellectuals until the early 
20 th century.159 The ideology espoused by Islamists such as the Muslim Brotherhood is mostly supported by the lowermiddle strata of Egyptian society.160 Egypt has the oldest continuous parliamentary tradition in the Arab world.161 The first popular assembly was established in 1866. It was disbanded as a result of the British occupation of 1882 and the British allowed only a consultative body to sit. In 1923 however after the countrys independence was declared a new constitution provided for a parliamentary monarchy.161 Military and foreign relations Main articles Egyptian Armed Forces and Foreign relations of Egypt Egyptian honour guard soldiers during a visit of U.S. Navy Adm. Mike Mullen The military is influential in the political and economic life of Egypt and exempts itself from laws that apply to other sectors. It enjoys considerable power prestige and independence within the state and has been widely considered part of the Egyptian deep state.79162163 Egypt is speculated by Israel to be the second country in the region with a spy satellite EgyptSat 1164 in addition to EgyptSat 2 launched on 16 April 20

1.3  billion.166 In 1989 Egypt was designated as a major nonNATO ally of the United States.167 Nevertheless ties between the two countries have partially soured since the July 2013 overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi168 with the Obama administration denouncing Egypt over its crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and cancelling future military exercises involving the two countries.169 There have been recent attempts however to normalise relations between the two with both governments frequently calling for mutual support in the fight against regional and international terrorism.170171172 However following the election of Republican Donald Trump as the President of the United States the two countries were looking to improve the EgyptianAmerican relations. On 3 April 2017 alSisi met with Trump at the White House marking the first visit of an Egyptian president to Washington in 8 years. Trump praised alSisi in what was reported as a public relations victory for the Egyptian president and signaled it was time for a normalisation of the relations between Egypt and the US.173 Relations with Russia have improved significantly following Mohamed Morsis removal174 and both countries have worked since then to strengthen military175 and trade ties176 among other aspects of bilateral cooperation. Relations with China have also improved considerably. In 2014 Egypt and China established a bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership.177 The permanent headquarters of the Arab League are located in Cairo and the bodys secretary general has traditionally been Egyptian. This position is currently held by former foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit. The Arab League briefly moved from Egypt to Tunis in 1978 to protest the EgyptIsrael peace treaty but it later returned to Cairo in 1989. Gulf monarchies including the United Arab Emirates178 and Saudi Arabia179 have pledged billions of dollars to help Egypt overcome its economic difficulties since the overthrow of Morsi.180 President elSisi with US President Joe Biden 11 November 2022 Following the 1973 war and the subsequent peace treaty Egypt became the first Arab nation to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. Despite that Israel is still widely considered as a hostile state by the majority of Egyptians.181 Egypt has played a historical role as a mediator in resolving various disputes in the Middle East most notably its handling of the IsraeliPalestinian conflict and the peace process.182 Egypts ceasefire and truce brokering efforts in Gaza have hardly been challenged following Israels evacuation of its settlements from the strip in 2005 despite increasing animosity towards the Hamas government in Gaza following the ouster of Mohamed Morsi183 and despite recent attempts by countries like Turkey and Qatar to take over this role.184 Ties between Egypt and other nonArab Middle Eastern nations including Iran and Turkey have often been strained. Tensions with Iran are mostly due to Egypts peace treaty with Israel and Irans rivalry with traditional Egyptian allies in the Gulf.185 Turkeys recent support for the nowbanned Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and its alleged involvement in Libya also made both countries bitter regional rivals.186 Egypt is a founding member of the NonAligned Movement and the United Nations. It is also a member of the Organisation internationale de la francophonie since 1983. Former Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister Boutros BoutrosGhali served as SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations from 1991 to 1996. In 2008 Egypt was estimated to have two million African refugees including over 20000 Sudanese nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees fleeing armed conflict or asylum seekers. Egypt adopted harsh sometimes lethal methods of border control.187 Law Main article Egyptian Civil Code The High Court of Justice in Downtown Cairo The legal system is based on Islamic and civil law particularly Napoleonic codes and judicial review by a Supreme Court which accepts compulsory International Court of Justice jurisdiction only with reservations.66 Islamic jurisprudence is the principal source of legislation. Sharia courts and qadis are run and licensed by the Ministry of Justice.188 The personal status law that regulates matters such as marriage divorce and child custody is governed by Sharia. In a family court a womans testimony is worth half of a mans testimony.189 On 26 December 2012 the Muslim Brotherhood attempted to institutionalise a controversial new constitution. It was approved by the public in a referendum held 1522 December 2012 with 64 support but with only 33 electorate participation.190 It replaced the 2011 Provisional Constitution of Egypt adopted following the revolution. The Penal code was unique as it contains a Blasphemy Law.191 The present court system allows a death penalty including against an absent individual tried in absentia. Several Americans and Canadians were sentenced to death in 20
12.1 92 On 18 January 2014 the interim government successfully institutionalised a more secular constitution.193 The president is elected to a fouryear term and may serve 2 terms.193 The parliament may impeach the president.193 Under the constitution there is a guarantee of gender equality and absolute freedom of thought.193 The military retains the ability to appoint the national Minister of Defence for the next two full presidential terms since the constitution took effect.193 Under the constitution political parties may not be based on religion race gender or geography.193 Human rights Main article Human rights in Egypt See also Sudanese refugees in Egypt August 2013 Rabaa massacre and Persecution of Copts In 2003 the government established the National Council for Human Rights.194 Shortly after its foundation the council came under heavy criticism by local activists who contend it was a propaganda tool for the government to excuse its own violations195 and to give legitimacy to repressive laws such as the Emergency Law.196 Protesters from the Third Square movement which supported neither the former Morsi government nor the Armed Forces 31 July 2013 The Pew Forum on Religion  Public Life ranks Egypt as the fifth worst country in the world for religious freedom.197198 The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom a bipartisan independent agency of the US government has placed Egypt on its watch list of countries that require close monitoring due to the nature and extent of violations of religious freedom engaged in or tolerated by the government.199 According to a 2010 Pew Global Attitudes survey 84 of Egyptians polled supported the death penalty for those who leave Islam 77 supported whippings and cutting off of hands for theft and robbery and 82 support stoning a person who commits adultery.200 Coptic Christians face discrimination at multiple levels of the government ranging from underrepresentation in government ministries to laws that limit their ability to build or repair churches.201 Intolerance towards followers of the Bah Faith and those of the nonorthodox Muslim sects such as Sufis Shia and Ahmadis also remains a problem.91 When the government moved to computerise identification cards members of religious minorities such as Bahs could not obtain identification documents.202 An Egyptian court ruled in early 2008 that members of other faiths may obtain identity cards without listing their faiths and without becoming officially recognised.203 Clashes continued between police and supporters of former President Mohamed Morsi. During violent clashes that ensued as part of the August 2013 sitin dispersal 595 protesters were killed204 with 14 August 2013 becoming the single deadliest day in Egypts modern history.205 Egypt actively practices capital punishment. Egypts authorities do not release figures on death sentences and executions despite repeated requests over the years by human rights organisations.206 The United Nations human rights office207 and various NGOs206208 expressed deep alarm after an Egyptian Minya Criminal Court sentenced 529 people to death in a single hearing on 25 March 2014. Sentenced supporters of former President Mohamed Morsi were to be executed for their alleged role in violence following his removal in July 2013. The judgement was condemned as a violation of international law.209 By May 2014 approximately 16000 people and as high as more than 40000 by one independent count according to The Economist210 mostly Brotherhood members or supporters have been imprisoned after Morsis removal211 after the Muslim Brotherhood was labelled as terrorist organisation by the postMorsi interim Egyptian government.212 According to human rights groups there are some 60000 political prisoners in Egypt.213214 Prominent Egyptian dissident Alaa Abd ElFattah was sentenced to five years of imprisonment in December 20
21.2 15 Homosexuality is illegal in Egypt.216 According to a 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center 95 of Egyptians believe that homosexuality should not be accepted by society.217 In 2017 Cairo was voted the most dangerous megacity for women with more than 10 million inhabitants in a poll by Thomson Reuters Foundation. Sexual harassment was described as occurring on a daily basis.218 Freedom of the press Reporters Without Borders ranked Egypt in their 2017 World Press Freedom Index at No. 160 out of 180 nations. At least 18 journalists were imprisoned in Egypt as of August 20
15 update. A new antiterror law was enacted in August 2015 that threatens members of the media with fines ranging from about US25000 to 60000 for the distribution of wrong information on acts of terror inside the country that differ from official declarations of the Egyptian Department of Defense.219 Some critics of the government have been arrested for allegedly spreading false information about the COVID19 pandemic in Egypt.220221 Administrative divisions Main articles Governorates of Egypt and Subdivisions of Egypt Egypt is divided into 27 governorates.

Egypts economy depends mainly on agriculture media petroleum exports natural gas and tourism. There are also more than three million Egyptians working abroad mainly in Libya Saudi Arabia the Persian Gulf and Europe. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the timehonoured place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population limited arable land and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy. In 2022 the Egyptian economy entered an ongoing crisis the Egyptian pound was one of the worst performing currencies223 inflation. reached 
32.6  and core inflation reached nearly 40 in March.224 The government has invested in communications and physical infrastructure. Egypt has received United States foreign aid since 1979 an average of 
2.2  billion per year and is the thirdlargest recipient of such funds from the United States following the Iraq war. Egypts economy mainly relies on these sources of income tourism remittances from Egyptians working abroad and revenues from the Suez Canal.225 In recent years the Egyptian army has expanded its economic influence dominating sectors such as petrol stations fishfarming car manufacturing media infrastructure including roads and bridges and cement production. This hold on various industries has resulted in a suppression of competition deterring private investment and leading to adverse effects for ordinary Egyptians including slower growth higher prices and limited opportunities.226 The militaryowned National Service Products Organization NSPO continues its expansion by establishing new factories dedicated to producing fertilisers irrigation equipment and veterinary vaccines. Businesses operated by the military such as Wataniya and Safi which manage patrol stations and bottled water respectively remain under government ownership.227 Economic conditions have started to improve considerably after a period of stagnation due to the adoption of more liberal economic policies by the government as well as increased revenues from tourism and a booming stock market. In its annual report the International Monetary Fund IMF has rated Egypt as one of the top countries in the world undertaking economic reforms.228 Some major economic reforms undertaken by the government since 2003 include a dramatic slashing of customs and tariffs. A new taxation law implemented in 2005 decreased corporate taxes from 40 to the current 20 resulting in a stated 100 increase in tax revenue by 2006. Smart Village a business district established in 2001 to facilitate the growth of hightech businesses Although one of the main obstacles still facing the Egyptian economy is the limited trickle down of wealth to the average population many Egyptians criticise their government for higher prices of basic goods while their standards of living or purchasing power remains relatively stagnant. Corruption is often cited by Egyptians as the main impediment to further economic growth.229230 The government promised major reconstruction of the countrys infrastructure using money paid for the newly acquired third mobile license 3 billion by Etisalat in 20

The Giza Necropolis is one of Egypts main tourist attractions. Tourism is one of the most important sectors in Egypts economy. More than 
12.8  million tourists visited Egypt in 2008 providing revenues of nearly 11 billion. The tourism sector employs about 12 of Egypts workforce.236 Tourism Minister Hisham Zaazou told industry professionals and reporters that tourism generated some 
9.4  billion in 2012 a slight increase over the 9 billion seen in 20
11.2 37 The Giza Necropolis is one of Egypts bestknown tourist attractions it is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence. Egypts beaches on the Mediterranean and the Red Sea which extend to over 3000 kilometres 1900 miles are also popular tourist destinations the Gulf of Aqaba beaches Safaga Sharm elSheikh Hurghada Luxor Dahab Ras Sidr and Marsa Alam are popular sites. Energy Main article Energy in Egypt An offshore platform in the Darfeel Gas Field Egypt has a developed energy market based on coal oil natural gas and hydro power. Substantial coal deposits in the northeast Sinai are mined at the rate of about 600000 tonnes 590000 long tons 660000 short tons per year. Oil and gas are produced in the western desert regions the Gulf of Suez and the Nile Delta. Egypt has huge reserves of gas estimated at 2180 cubic kilometres 520 cu mi238 and LNG up to 2012 exported to many countries. In 2013 the Egyptian General Petroleum Co EGPC said the country will cut exports of natural gas and tell major industries to slow output this summer to avoid an energy crisis and stave off political unrest Reuters has reported. Egypt is counting on top liquid natural gas LNG exporter Qatar to obtain additional gas volumes in summer while encouraging factories to plan their annual maintenance for those months of peak demand said EGPC chairman Tarek El Barkatawy. Egypt produces its own energy but has been a net oil importer since 2008 and is rapidly becoming a net importer of natural gas.239 Egypt produced 691000 bbld of oil and 21
41.0 5 Tcf of natural gas in 2013 making the country the largest nonOPEC producer of oil and the secondlargest dry natural gas producer in Africa. In 2013 Egypt was the largest consumer of oil and natural gas in Africa as more than 20 of total oil consumption and more than 40 of total dry natural gas consumption in Africa. Also Egypt possesses the largest oil refinery capacity in Africa 726000 bbld in 20

The main line of the nations 408
00 kilometre 25400 mi railway network runs from Alexandria to Aswan and is operated by Egyptian National Railways. The vehicle road network has expanded rapidly to over 34000 km 21000 mi consisting of 28 line 796 stations 1800 train covering the Nile Valley and Nile Delta the Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts the Sinai and the Western oases. The Cairo Metro line 2 The Cairo Metro consists of three operational lines with a fourth line expected in the future. EgyptAir which is now the countrys flag carrier and largest airline was founded in 1932 by Egyptian industrialist Talaat Harb today owned by the Egyptian government. The airline is based at Cairo International Airport its main hub operating scheduled passenger and freight services to more than 75 destinations in the Middle East Europe Africa Asia and the Americas. The Current EgyptAir fleet includes 80 aeroplanes. Suez Canal Main article Suez Canal The Suez Canal Bridge The Suez Canal is an artificial sealevel waterway in Egypt connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work it allows ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa. The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfiq at the city of Suez. Ismailia lies on its west bank 3 kilometres 178 miles from the halfway point. The canal is 1
93.3 0 km 12018 mi long 24 metres 79 feet deep and 205 m 673 ft wide as of 20
10 update. It consists of the northern access channel of 22 km 14 mi the canal itself of 1
62.2 5 km 10078 mi and the southern access channel of 9 km 512 mi. The canal is a single lane with passing places in the Ballah ByPass and the Great Bitter Lake. It contains no locks seawater flows freely through the canal. On 26 August 2014 a proposal was made for opening a New Suez Canal. Work on the New Suez Canal was completed in July 20
15.2 41242 The channel was officially inaugurated with a ceremony attended by foreign leaders and featuring military flyovers on 6 August 2015 in accordance with the budgets laid out for the project.243244 Water supply and sanitation Main article Water supply and sanitation in Egypt Green irrigated land along the Nile amidst the desert and in the delta The piped water supply in Egypt increased between 1990 and 2010 from 89 to 100 in urban areas and from 39 to 93 in rural areas despite rapid population growth. Over that period Egypt achieved the elimination of open defecation in rural areas and invested in infrastructure. Access to an improved water source in Egypt is now practically universal with a rate of 99. About one half of the population is connected to sanitary sewers.245 Partly because of low sanitation coverage about 17000 children die each year because of diarrhoea.246 Another challenge is low cost recovery due to water tariffs that are among the lowest in the world. This in turn requires government subsidies even for operating costs a situation that has been aggravated by salary increases without tariff increases after the Arab Spring. Poor operation of facilities such as water and wastewater treatment plants as well as limited government accountability and transparency are also issues. Due to the absence of appreciable rainfall Egypts agriculture depends entirely on irrigation. The main source of irrigation water is the river Nile of which the flow is controlled by the high dam at Aswan. It releases on average 55 cubic kilometres 45000000 acreft water per year of which some 46 cubic kilometres 37000000 acreft are diverted into the irrigation canals.247 In the Nile valley and delta almost 33600 square kilometres 13000 sq mi of land benefit from these irrigation waters producing on average 
1.8  crops per year.247 Demographics Main articles Demographics of Egypt and Egyptians Egypts population density people per km2 Egypt is the most populated country in the Arab world and the third most populous on the African continent with about 95 million inhabitants as of 20
17 update.248 Its population grew rapidly from 1970 to 2010 due to medical advances and increases in agricultural productivity249 enabled by the Green Revolution.250 Egypts population was estimated at 3 million when Napoleon invaded the country in 17
98.2 51 Egypts people are highly urbanised being concentrated along the Nile notably Cairo and Alexandria in the Delta and near the Suez Canal. Egyptians are divided demographically into those who live in the major urban centres and the fellahin or farmers that reside in rural villages. The total inhabited area constitutes only 77041 km putting the physiological density at over 1200 people per km2 similar to Bangladesh. While emigration was restricted under Nasser thousands of Egyptian professionals were dispatched abroad in the context of the Arab Cold War.252 Egyptian emigration was liberalised in 1971 under President Sadat reaching record numbers after the 1973 oil crisis.253 An estimated 
2.7  million Egyptians live abroad. Approximately 70 of Egyptian migrants live in Arab countries 923600 in Saudi Arabia 332600 in Libya 226850 in Jordan 190550 in Kuwait with the rest elsewhere in the region and the remaining 30 reside mostly in Europe and North America 318000 in the United States 110000 in Canada and 90000 in Italy.233 The process of emigrating to nonArab states has been ongoing since the 19
50 s.254 Ethnic groups Ethnic Egyptians are by far the largest ethnic group in the country constituting 
99.7  of the total population.66 Ethnic minorities include the Abazas Turks Greeks Bedouin Arab tribes living in the eastern deserts and the Sinai Peninsula the Berberspeaking Siwis Amazigh of the Siwa Oasis and the Nubian communities clustered along the Nile. There are also tribal Beja communities concentrated in the southeasternmost corner of the country and a number of Dom clans mostly in the Nile Delta and Faiyum who are progressively becoming assimilated as urbanisation increases. Some 5 million immigrants live in Egypt mostly Sudanese some of whom have lived in Egypt for generations.255 Smaller numbers of immigrants come from Iraq Ethiopia Somalia South Sudan and Eritrea.255 The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that the total number of people of concern refugees asylum seekers and stateless people was about 250000. In 2015 the number of registered Syrian refugees in Egypt was 117000 a decrease from the previous year.255 Egyptian government claims that a halfmillion Syrian refugees live in Egypt are thought to be exaggerated.255 There are 28000 registered Sudanese refugees in Egypt.255 Jewish communities in Egypt have almost disappeared. Several important Jewish archaeological and historical sites are found in Cairo Alexandria and other cities.

The main foreign languages taught in schools by order of popularity are English French German and Italian. Historically Egyptian was spoken the latest stage of which is Coptic Egyptian. Spoken Coptic was mostly extinct by the 
17 th century but may have survived in isolated pockets in Upper Egypt as late as the 
19 th century. It remains in use as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.257258 It forms a separate branch among the family of Afroasiatic languages. Religion Main article Religion in Egypt MadrasaMosque of Sultan Hassan Egypt has the largest Muslim population in the Arab world and the sixth worlds largest Muslim population and home for 5 of the worlds Muslim population.259 Egypt also has the largest Christian population in the Middle East and North Africa.260 Egypt is a predominantly Sunni Muslim country with Islam as its state religion. The percentage of adherents of various religions is a controversial topic in Egypt. An estimated 8590 are identified as Muslim 1015 as Coptic Christians and 1 as other Christian denominations although without a census the numbers cannot be known. Other estimates put the Christian population as high as 1520.d Nondenominational Muslims form roughly 12 of the population.4266 Egypt was a Christian country before the 
7 th century and after Islam arrived the country was gradually Islamised into a majorityMuslim country.267268 It is not known when Muslims reached a majority variously estimated from c.1000 CE to as late as the 
14 th century. Egypt emerged as a centre of politics and culture in the Muslim world. Under Anwar Sadat Islam became the official state religion and Sharia the main source of law.269 It is estimated that 15 million Egyptians follow Native Sufi orders270271272 with the Sufi leadership asserting that the numbers are much greater as many Egyptian Sufis are not officially registered with a Sufi order.271 At least 305 people were killed during a November 2017 attack on a Sufi mosque in Sinai.273 There is also a Shia minority. The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs estimates the Shia population at 1 to 
2.2  million274 and could measure as much as 3 million.275 The Ahmadiyya population is estimated at less than 50000276 whereas the Salafi ultraconservative Sunni population is estimated at five to six million.277 Cairo is famous for its numerous mosque minarets and has been dubbed The City of 1000 Minarets.278 St. Mark Coptic Cathedral in Alexandria Of the Christian population in Egypt over 90 belong to the native Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria an Oriental Orthodox Christian Church.279 Other native Egyptian Christians are adherents of the Coptic Catholic Church the Evangelical Church of Egypt and various other Protestant denominations.

Other faiths and minority Muslim sects practised by Egyptians such as the small Bah Faith and Ahmadiyya communities are not recognised by the state and face persecution by the government which labels these groups a threat to Egypts national security.282283 Individuals particularly Bahs and atheists wishing to include their religion or lack thereof on their mandatory state issued identification cards are denied this ability see Egyptian identification card controversy and are put in the position of either not obtaining required identification or lying about their faith. A 2008 court ruling allowed members of unrecognised faiths to obtain identification and leave the religion field blank.202203 Education Main article Education in Egypt Cairo University Egyptian literacy rate among the population aged 15 years and older by UNESCO Institute of Statistics The illiteracy rate has decreased since 1996 from 
39.4  to 
25.9  percent in 2013. The adult literacy rate as of July 20
14 update was estimated at 

73.9.2 84 The illiteracy rate is highest among those over 60 years of age being estimated at 
64.9  while illiteracy among youth between 15 and 24 years of age was listed at 
8.6  percent.285 A Europeanstyle education system was first introduced in Egypt by the Ottomans in the early 
19 th century to nurture a class of loyal bureaucrats and army officers.286 Under British occupation investment in education was curbed drastically and secular public schools which had previously been free began to charge fees.286 In the 19
50 s President Nasser phased in free education for all Egyptians.286 The Egyptian curriculum influenced other Arab education systems which often employed Egyptiantrained teachers.286 Demand soon outstripped the level of available state resources causing the quality of public education to deteriorate.286 Today this trend has culminated in poor teacherstudent ratios often around one to fifty and persistent gender inequality.286 Basic education which includes six years of primary and three years of preparatory school is a right for Egyptian children from the age of six.287 After grade 9 students are tracked into one of two strands of secondary education general or technical schools. General secondary education prepares students for further education and graduates of this track normally join higher education institutes based on the results of the Thanaweya Amma the leaving exam.287 Technical secondary education has two strands one lasting three years and a more advanced education lasting five. Graduates of these schools may have access to higher education based on their results on the final exam but this is generally uncommon.287 Cairo University is Egypts premier public university. The country is currently opening new research institutes for the aim of modernising research in the nation the most recent example of which is Zewail City of Science and Technology. Egypt was ranked

4.6 6 of the countrys GDP. In 2009 there were 
16.0 4 physicians and 
33.8 0 nurses per 10000 inhabitants.291 As a result of modernisation efforts over the years Egypts healthcare system has made great strides forward. Access to healthcare in both urban and rural areas greatly improved and immunisation programmes are now able to cover 98 of the population. Life expectancy increased from 
44.8  years during the 19

Egyptian identity evolved in the span of a long period of occupation to accommodate Islam Christianity and Judaism and a new language Arabic and its spoken descendant Egyptian Arabic which is also based on many Ancient Egyptian words.297 The work of early 
19 th century scholar Rifaa alTahtawi renewed interest in Egyptian antiquity and exposed Egyptian society to Enlightenment principles. Tahtawi cofounded with education reformer Ali Mubarak a native Egyptology school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars such as Suyuti and Maqrizi who themselves studied the history language and antiquities of Egypt.298 Egypts renaissance peaked in the late 
19 th and early 
20 th centuries through the work of people like Muhammad Abduh Ahmed Lutfi elSayed Muhammad Loutfi Goumah Tawfiq elHakim Louis Awad Qasim Amin Salama Moussa Taha Hussein and Mahmoud Mokhtar.

The Cairo International Film Festival has been rated as one of 11 festivals with a top class rating worldwide by the International Federation of Film Producers Associations.311 The number of cinemas increased with the emergence of talking films and reached 395 in 1958. This number began to decline after the establishment of television in 1960 and the establishment of the public sector in cinemas in 1962 and reached 297 in 1965 then to 141 in 1995 due to the circulation of films through video equipment though the boom of the film industry in this period. Due to laws and procedures that encouraged investment in the establishment of private cinemas they increased again especially in commercial centres until their number reached 200 in 2001 and 400 in 2009. Over a period of more than a hundred years Egyptian cinema has presented more than four thousand films.312313 Music Main article Music of Egypt Ancient Egyptians playing music Egyptian music is a rich mixture of indigenous Mediterranean African and Western elements.

The ending of the Hebrew form is either a dual or an ending identical to the dual in form perhaps a locative and this has sometimes been taken as referring to the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt. However the application of the possibly dual ending to some toponyms and other words a development peculiar to Hebrew does not in fact imply any twoness about the place. The ending is found for example in the Hebrew words for such single entities as water  noon  skyheaven  and in the qere  but not the original ketiv  of Jerusalem . It should also be noted that the dual ending  which may or may not be what the yim in Mitzryim actually represents  was available to other Semitic languages such as Arabic but was not applied to Egypt.
