They are the earliest known corpus of ancient Egyptian religious texts.12 Written in Old Egyptian the pyramid texts were carved onto the subterranean walls and sarcophagi of pyramids at Saqqara from the end of the Fifth Dynasty and throughout the Sixth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom and into the Eighth Dynasty of the First Intermediate Period.34 The oldest of the texts have been dated to c. 24002300 BCE.5 Unlike the later Coffin Texts and Book of the Dead the Pyramid Texts were reserved only for the pharaoh and were not illustrated.6 The use and occurrence of Pyramid Texts changed between the Old Middle and New Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt. During the Old Kingdom 2686 BCE  2181 BCE Pyramid Texts could be found in the pyramids of kings as well as three queens named Wedjebten Neith and Iput. During the Middle Kingdom 2055 BCE  1650 BCE Pyramid Texts were not written in the pyramids of the pharaohs but the traditions of the pyramid spells continued to be practiced. In the New Kingdom 1550 BCE  1070 BCE Pyramid Texts were found on tombs of officials.7 Discoveryedit Pyramid of Merenre I one of the earliest pyramids in which Maspero discovered the Pyramid Texts. French archaeologist and Egyptologist Gaston Maspero director of the French Institute for Oriental Archaeology in Cairo arrived in Egypt in 1880. He chose a site in South Saqqara a hill that had been mapped by the Prussian Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius in 1842 for his first archaeological dig. There Maspero found the ruins of a large structure which he concluded must be the pyramid of Pepi I of the Sixth Dynasty. During the excavations he was able to gain access to the subterranean rooms and discovered that the walls of the structure were covered in hieroglyphic text.8 Maspero contacted the director of the excavations in Egypt Auguste Mariette to inform him of the discovery. Mariette concluded that the structure must be a mastaba as no writing had previously been discovered in a pyramid.9 Maspero continued his excavations at a second structure around one kilometre 
0.6 2 mi southwest of the first in search of more evidence. This second structure was determined to be the pyramid of Merenre I Pepi Is successor.10 In it Maspero discovered the same hieroglyphic text on the walls he had found in Pepi Is pyramid11 and the mummy of a man in the sarcophagus of the burial chamber.121314 This time he visited Mariette personally who again rejected the findings saying on his deathbed that in thirty years of Egyptian excavations I have never seen a pyramid whose underground rooms had hieroglyphs written on their walls.10 Throughout 1881 Maspero continued to direct investigations of other sites in Saqqara and more texts were found in each of the pyramids of Unas Teti and Pepi II.10 Maspero began publishing his findings in the Recueil des Travaux from 1882 and continued to be involved until 1886 in the excavations of the pyramid in which the texts had been found.15 Maspero published the first corpora of the text in 1894 in French under the title Les inscriptions des pyramides de Saqqarah.1116 Translations were made by German Egyptologist Kurt Heinrich Sethe to German in 19081910 in Die altgyptischen Pyramidentexte.11 The concordance that Sethe published is considered to be the standard version of the texts.16 Samuel A. B. Mercer published a translation into English of Sethes work in 19
52.1 7 British Egyptologist Raymond O. Faulkner presented the texts in English in 1969 in The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts.11 Cartouches of Pepi I and Pyramid Texts. Limestone block fragment from the debris of the north wall of the antechamber within the pyramid of Pepi I at Saqqara. Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology Between 1926 and 1932 Gustave Jquier conducted the first systematic investigations of Pepi II and his wives pyramids  Neith Iput II and Wedjebetni.21815 Jquier also conducted the excavations of Qakare Ibis pyramid.16 He later published the complete corpus of texts found in these five pyramids.16 Since 1958 expeditions under the directions of JeanPhilippe Lauer Jean SainteFare Garnot and Jean Leclant have undertaken a major restoration project of the pyramids belonging to Teti Pepi I and Merenre I as well as the pyramid of Unas.1619 By 1999 the pyramid of Pepi had been opened to the public. Debris was cleared away from the pyramid while research continued under the direction of Audran Labrousse fr.15 The corpus of pyramid texts in Pepi Is pyramid were published in 20

From the pyramid of Pepi II at Saqqara. Neues Museum The spells or utterances of the Pyramid Texts were primarily concerned with enabling the transformation of the deceased into an Akh where those judged worthy could mix with the gods.22 The spells of the Pyramid Texts are divided into two broad categories Sacerdotal texts and Personal texts.23 The sacerdotal texts are ritual in nature and were conducted by the lector priest addressing the deceased in the second person.24 They consist of offering spells25 short spells recited in the presentation of an offering26 and recitations which are predominantly instructional.27 These texts appear in the Offering and Insignia Rituals the Resurrection Ritual and in the four pyramids containing the Morning Ritual.2428 The writing in these texts Dramatic Texts suggests the formulation of these texts may have occurred around the time of the Second and Third dynasties.28 The remaining texts are personal and are broadly concerned with guiding the spirit out of the tomb and into new life.26 They consist of provisioning transition and apotropaic  or protective28  texts.29 The provisioning texts deal with the deceased taking command of his own foodsupply and demanding nourishment from the gods.30 One example of these texts is the kings response in Unas pyramid.3031 The transition texts  otherwise known as the Sakhu or Glorifications28  are predominantly about the transformation of the deceased into an Akh28 and their ascent mirroring the motion of the gods into the sky.32 These texts form the largest part of the corpus and are dominated by the youngest texts composed in the Fifth and possibly Sixth dynasties.28 Apotropaic texts consist of short protective spells for warding off threats to the body and tomb.333428 Due to the archaic style of writing these texts are considered to be the oldest28 and are the most difficult to interpret.34 These utterances were meant to be chanted by those who were reciting them.clarification needed They contained many verbs such as fly and leap depicting the actions taken by the pharaohs to get to the afterlife.35 The spells delineate all of the ways the pharaoh could travel including the use of ramps stairs ladders and most importantly flying. The spells could also be used to call the gods to help even threatening them if they did not comply.36 It was common for the pyramid texts to be written in the first person but not uncommon for texts to be later changed to the third person. Often this depended on who was reciting the texts and who they were recited for.37 Many of the texts include accomplishments of the pharaoh as well as the things they did for the Egyptian people during the time of their rule. These texts were used to both guide the pharaohs to the afterlife but also to inform and assure the living that the soul made it to its final destination.35 Appearance in pyramidsedit Pyramid of Unasedit The Pyramid Texts inscribed on the subterranean walls of Unas pyramid The texts first appeared in the pyramid of the last pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty that belonging to Unas.381 A total of 283 spells
39 a appear on the subterranean walls of Unas pyramid.38 These spells are the smallest and bestpreserved corpus of the texts in the Old Kingdom.42 Copies of all but a single spell PT 200 inscribed in the pyramid appeared throughout the Middle Kingdom and later including a nearcomplete replica of the texts inscribed in the tomb of the 
12 thDynasty High Priest Senwosretankh at ElLisht.4344 Unas pyramid situated between the pyramids of Djoser and Sekhemkhet in North Saqqara45 was the smallest of those built in the Old Kingdom.38 It had a core built six steps high from roughly dressed limestone encased in a layer of carefully cut fine white limestone.46 It had a base length of 
57.7 5 m 189 ft with an incline of 56 which gave the pyramid a height of 43 m 141 ft.47 The substructure was accessed through an entrance in the pavement of a chapel on the north face of the pyramid.4849 The entry led into a downward sloping corridor followed by a corridorchamber with three granite portcullises that guarded the entrance into the horizontal passage. The horizontal passage ends at the antechamber of the substructure and is guarded by a fourth granite portcullis. The antechamber connects to two further rooms a room with three recesses for holding statues  called the serdab50  to the east and the burial chamber with the rulers sarcophagus to the west.51 The roofs of both the antechamber and burial chamber were gabled.49 With the exception of the walls immediately surrounding the sarcophagus which were lined with alabaster and painted to resemble reed mats with a woodframe enclosure the remaining walls of the antechamber burial chamber and a section of the horizontal passage were covered with vertical columns of hieroglyphs that make up the Pyramid Texts.51 Unas sarcophagus was left without inscription. The kings royal titulary did not appear on the walls surrounding it as it does in later pyramids.52 Maspero in the burial chamber of Unas pyramid which has lines of protective spells on the west gable which are the only inscriptions on the walls surrounding the sarcophagus The west gable of the burial chamber is inscribed with protective spells52 in later pyramids the gable was used for texts commending the king to Nut53 and from Pepi I onwards also for Sakhu54 or glorifications for the transformation into an Akh.2855 The other walls of the burial chamber are primarily dedicated to ritual texts.56 The north wall along with the northern part of the east wall and passage is dedicated to the Offering Ritual.575828 Spatial considerations required that part of the ritual be inscribed on other walls and likely explains the omission of the Insignia Ritual altogether from the pyramid.58 The Offering Ritual from the initial libation to the dedication of offerings occupies the north wall it is arrayed into three horizontal registers.5859 The set up and layout of the Unas pyramid were replicated and expanded on for future pyramids. The causeway ran 750 meters long and is still in good condition unlike many causeways found in similar ancient Egyptian pyramids.60 In the pyramid of Unas the ritual texts could be found in the underlying supporting structure. The antechamber and corridor contained texts and spells personalized to the Pharaoh himself.36 Kurt Sethes first edition of the pyramid texts contained 714 distinct spells. Later additional spells were discovered for a total of 759. No single edition includes all recorded spells. The following example of a spell comes from the pyramid of Unas. It was to be recited in the South Side Burial Chamber and Passage and it was the Invocation to New Life. Utterance 213 Ho Unis You have not gone away dead you have gone away alive. Sit on Osiriss chair with your baton in your arm and govern the living with your water lily scepter in your arm and govern those of the inaccessible places. Your lower arms are of Atum your upper arms of Atum your belly of Atum your back of Atum your rear of Atum your legs of Atum your face of Anubis. Horuss mounds shall serve you Seths mounds shall serve you.61 Offerings and ritualsedit The various pyramid texts often contained writings of rituals and offerings to the gods. Examples of these rituals are the opening of the mouth ceremony offering rituals and insignia ritual. Both monetary and prayerbased offerings were made in the pyramids and were written in the pyramid texts in hopes of getting the pharaoh to a desirable afterlife.62 Rituals such as the opening of the mouth and eye ceremony were very important for the Pharaoh in the afterlife. This ceremony involved the KherHeb the chief lector priest along with assistants opening the eyes and mouth of the dead while reciting prayers and spells. Mourners were encouraged to cry out as special instruments were used to cut holes in the mouth. After the ceremony was complete it was believed that the dead could eat speak breathe and see in the afterlife.63 The Egyptian pyramids are made up of various corridors tunnels and rooms each of which have differing significance and use during the burial and ritual processes.60 Texts were written and recited by priests in a very particular order often starting in the Valley Temple and finishing in the Coffin or Pyramid Room. The variety of offerings and rituals were also most likely recited in a particular order. The Valley Temple often contained an offering shrine where rituals would be recited.64 Queens with pyramid textsedit Pyramid texts were found not only in the tombs of kings but those of queens as well. Queen Neith who was the wife of Pepi II is one of three queens of the 
6 th dynasty whose tomb contains pyramid texts.65 The pyramids of the other two queens both also thought to be wives of Pepi II Iput II and Wedjebetni also contained tombs inscribed with texts. Those of Neith have been kept in much better condition.5 Compared to the tombs of the kings the layout and structure of those that belonged to these queens were much simpler. But the layout of the texts corresponded to similar walls and locations as those of the kings. For example the Resurrection Ritual is found on the east end of the south wall. Due to the fact that the pyramid of Neith did not contain an antechamber many of the spells normally written there were also written on the south wall.65 The texts of Queen Neith were similar and different from those of the kings in a few additional ways. Like those of the kings the use of both the first and third person is present in these pyramid texts. Neiths name is used throughout the texts to make them more personal. Many of the pronouns used throughout her pyramid texts are male indicative of the parallels between the texts of the kings and queens but a few female pronouns can be found. The texts also contain spells and utterances that are meant to be read by both the spirit herself as well as others addressing her.66 Examplesedit Pyramid Text inscribed on the wall of a subterranean room in Tetis pyramid After death the king must first rise from his tomb. Utterance 373 describes6 Oho Oho Rise up O Teti Take your head collect your bones Gather your limbs shake the earth from your flesh Take your bread that rots not your beer that sours not Stand at the gates that bar the common people The gatekeeper comes out to you he grasps your hand Takes you into heaven to your father Geb. He rejoices at your coming gives you his hands Kisses you caresses you Sets you before the spirits the imperishable stars... The hidden ones worship you The great ones surround you The watchers wait on you Barley is threshed for you Emmer is reaped for you Your monthly feasts are made with it Your halfmonth feasts are made with it As ordered done for you by Geb your father Rise up O Teti you shall not die Pyramid text utterances 302 to 312 on Unas burial chamber wall The texts then describe several ways for the pharaoh to reach the heavens one of which is by climbing a ladder. In utterance 304 the king says6 Hail daughter of Anubis above the hatches of heaven Comrade of Thoth above the ladders rails Open Unass path let Unas pass Another way is by ferry. If the boatman refuses to take him the king has other plans If you fail to ferry Unas He will leap and sit on the wing of Thoth Then he will ferry Unas to that side Cannibal Hymnedit Utterances 273 and 274 are sometimes known as the Cannibal Hymn because it seems to be describing the king hunting and eating parts of the gods6 however as Renouf pointed out when it was first published Those who see in all mythology a survival of ideas and practices of savages and think it a clever thing to explain by the habits of cannibals the myth of the god who swallows all his children without troubling themselves with that portion of the myth which gives the key to all the rest how the children come to life again67 As has been observed the spell is echoing how the Goddess Nut as the Sky causing the stars to disappear at dawn is likened to a sow eating her offspring68 so also is the King as the dawn sun.69 Utterance 217 describes the King in stellar form as being swallowed up at dawn with the other stars.70 The Cannibal Hymn represents a discrete episode Utterances 273274 in the anthology of ritual texts that make up the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom period. Appearing first in the Pyramid of Unas at the end of the Fifth Dynasty the Cannibal Hymn preserves an early royal butchery ritual in which the deceased king  assisted by the god Shezmu  slaughters cooks and eats the gods as sacrificial bulls thereby incorporating in himself their divine powers in order that he might negotiate his passage into the Afterlife and guarantee his transformation as a celestial divinity ruling in the heavens. The style and format of the Cannibal Hymn are characteristic of the oralrecitational poetry of pharaonic Egypt marked by allusive metaphor and the exploitation of wordplay and homophony in its verbal recreation of a butchery ritual. Pyramid text utterances 273 to 276 on Unas burial chamber wall Apart from the burial of Unas only the Pyramid of Teti displays the Cannibal Hymn. A god who lives on his fathers who feeds on his mothers... Unas is the bull of heaven Who rages in his heart Who lives on the being of every god Who eats their entrails When they come their bodies full of magic From the Isle of Flame... But as the same spell also declares May I be with you you gods May you be with me you gods. May I live with you you gods May you live with me you gods. I love you you gods May you love me you gods. The Cannibal Hymn later reappeared in the Coffin Texts as Spell 5
