5 th Dynasty Neferirkare Kakai known in Greek as Neferchers  was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh the third king of the Fifth Dynasty. Neferirkare the eldest son of Sahure with his consort Meretnebty was known as Ranefer A before he came to the throne. He acceded the day after his fathers death and reigned for eight to eleven years sometime in the early to mid
25 th century BCE. He was himself very likely succeeded by his eldest son born of his queen Khentkaus II the prince Ranefer B who would take the throne as king Neferefre. Neferirkare fathered another pharaoh Nyuserre Ini who took the throne after Neferefres short reign and the brief rule of the poorly known Shepseskare. Neferirkare was acknowledged by his contemporaries as a kind and benevolent ruler intervening in favour of his courtiers after a mishap. His rule witnessed a growth in the number of administration and priesthood officials who used their expanded wealth to build architecturally more sophisticated mastabas where they recorded their biographies for the first time. Neferirkare was the last pharaoh to significantly modify the standard royal titulary separating the nomen or birth name from the prenomen or throne name. From his reign onwards the former was written in a cartouche preceded by the Son of Ra epithet. His rule witnessed continuing trade relations with Nubia to the south and possibly with Byblos on the Levantine coast to the north. Neferirkare started a pyramid for himself in the royal necropolis of Abusir called BaNeferirkare meaning Neferirkare is a Ba. It was initially planned to be a step pyramid a form which had not been employed since the days of the Third Dynasty circa 120 years earlier. This plan was modified to transform the monument into a true pyramid the largest in Abusir which was never completed owing to the death of the king. In addition Neferirkare built a temple to the sun god Ra called Setibre that is Site of the heart of Ra. Ancient sources state that it was the largest one built during the Fifth Dynasty but as of the early 
21 st century it has not yet been located. After his death Neferirkare benefited from a funerary cult taking place in his mortuary temple which had been completed by his son Nyuserre Ini. This cult seems to have disappeared at the end of the Old Kingdom period although it might have been revived during the Twelfth Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom albeit in a very limited form. In all probability it was also around this time that the story of the Papyrus Westcar was first written a tale where Userkaf Sahure and Neferirkare are said to be brothers the sons of Ra with a woman Rededjet. Sourcesedit Neferirkares nomen Kakai on the Abydos king list. Contemporaneous sourcesedit Neferirkare is well attested in sources contemporaneous with his reign. Beyond his pyramid complex he is mentioned in the tomb of many of his contemporaries such as his vizier Washptah the courtier Rawer23 and the priest Akhethetep.24 Neferirkare also appears in the nearly contemporaneous Giza writing board a short list grouping six kings from different dynasties dating to the later Fifth or early Sixth Dynasty.25 The writing board was uncovered in the tomb of a high official named Mesdjerw who may have composed it for his use in the afterlife.26 Historical sourcesedit Neferirkare is attested in two ancient Egyptian king lists both dating to the New Kingdom. The earliest of these is the Abydos King List written during the reign of Seti I fl. 12901279 BCE. There Neferirkares nomen Kakai occupies the 
28 th entry in between those of Sahure and Neferefre. During the subsequent reign of Ramesses II fl. 12791213 BCE Neferirkares prenomen was recorded on the 
27 th entry of the Saqqara Tablet but this time as a successor of Sahure and predecessor of Shepseskare.27 Neferirkare was also given an entry in the Turin canon a document dating to the reign of Ramesses II as well. Neferirkares entry is commonly believed to be in the third column
19 th row unfortunately this line has been lost in a large lacuna affecting the papyrus and neither his reign length nor his successor can be ascertained from the surviving fragments. The Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has furthermore proposed that the Turin canon makes a new dynasty start with this entry and thus that Neferirkare would be its founder.282930 The division of the Turin canon list of kings into dynasties is a currently debated topic. The Egyptologist Jaromr Mlek for example sees the divisions between groups of kings occurring in the canon as marking transfers of royal residence rather than the rise and fall of royal dynasties as this term is currently understood. That usage only began in the Egyptian context with the 
3 rdcentury BCE work of the priest Manetho.31 Similarly the Egyptologist Stephan Seidlmeyer considers the break in the Turin Canon at the end of the Eighth Dynasty to represent the relocation of the royal residence from Memphis to Herakleopolis.32 The Egyptologist John Baines holds views that are closer to Verners believing that the canon was divided into dynasties with totals for the time elapsed given at the end of each though only a few such divisions have survived.33 Similarly Professor John Van Seters views the breaks in the canon as divisions between dynasties but in contrast states that the criterion for these divisions remains unknown. He speculates that the pattern of dynasties may have been taken from the nine divine kings of the Greater and Lesser Enneads.34 The Egyptologist Ian Shaw believes that the Turin Canon gives some credibility to Manethos division of dynasties but considers the king lists to be a form of ancestor worship and not a historical record.35 This whole problem could be mooted by another of Verners speculations where he proposes that Neferirkares entry may have been located on the 
20 th line rather than the 
19 th as is usually believed. This would credit Neferirkare with a sevenyear reign29 and would make Sahure the dynasty founder according to the hypothesis that the canon records such events. Archaeological evidence has established that the transitions from Userkaf to Sahure and from Sahure to Neferirkare were fatherson transitions so that neither Sahure nor Neferirkare can be dynasty founders in the modern sense of the term.3637 Neferirkare was mentioned in the Aegyptiaca a history of Egypt written in the 
3 rd century BCE during the reign of Ptolemy II 283246 BCE by Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. The Byzantine scholar George Syncellus reports that Africanus relates that the Aegyptiaca mentioned the succession Sephrs  Neferchers  Sisirs for the early Fifth Dynasty. Sephrs Neferchers and Sisirs are believed to be the hellenized forms for Sahure Neferirkare and Shepseskare respectively. Thus Manethos reconstruction of the Fifth Dynasty is in agreement with the Saqqara tablet.38 In Africanus epitome of the Aegyptiaca Neferchers is reported to have reigned for 20 years.39 Familyedit Parents and siblingsedit The Westcar Papyrus on display in the gyptisches Museum dates to the 
17 th Dynasty but its story was probably first written during the 
12 th Dynasty.40 Until 2005 the identity of Neferirkares parents was uncertain. Some Egyptologists including Nicolas Grimal William C. Hayes Hartwig Altenmller Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton viewed him as a son of Userkaf and Khentkaus I and a brother to his predecessor Sahure.541424344 The main impetus behind this theory was the Westcar Papyrus an Ancient Egyptian story narrating the rise of the Fifth Dynasty. In it a magician prophesizes to Khufu that the future demise of his lineage will be in the form of three brothers  the first three kings of the Fifth Dynasty born of the god Ra and a woman named Rededjet.45 Egyptologists such as Verner have sought to discern a historical truth in this account proposing that Sahure and Neferirkare were siblings born of queen Khentkaus I.note 247 In 2005 excavations of the causeway leading up to Sahures pyramid yielded new relief fragments which showed indisputably that pharaoh Sahure and his consort queen Meretnebty were Neferirkares parents. Indeed these reliefsdiscovered by Verner and Tarek El Awadydepict Sahure and Meretnebty together with their two sons Ranefer and Netjerirenre.36 While both sons are given the title of kings eldest son possibly indicating that they were twins49 Ranefer is shown closer to Sahure and also given the title of chief lectorpriest which may reflect that he was born first and thus given higher positions.50 Since Ranefer is known to have been the name of Neferirkare before he took the throne as indicated by reliefs from the mortuary temple of Sahure see below no doubt remains as to Neferirkares filiation.36 Nothing more is known about Netjerirenre an observation which has led Verner and ElAwady to speculate that he could have attempted to seize the throne upon the unexpected death of Neferirkares son and successor Neferefre who died in his early twenties after two years on the throne. In this conjectural hypothesis he would be the ephemeral Shepseskare.5150 Finally the same relief as well as an additional one record a further four sons of Sahure  Khakare52 Horemsaf53 Raemsaf and Nebankhre. The identity of their mothers is unknown54 so they are at minimum halfbrothers to Neferirkare.55 Fragments of reliefs from the mortuary temple of Sahure showing Neferirkare as a prince. The reliefs were altered during the latters reign with the addition of royal titles and regalia.5657 Consort and childrenedit As of the early 
21 st century the only known queen of Neferirkare is Khentkaus II. This is due to the position of her pyramid next to that of Neferirkare as was normal for the consort of a king as well as her title of kings wife and several reliefs representing both of them together.58 Neferirkare could possibly have had at least one other spouse as suggested by the presence of a small pyramid next to that of Khentkaus but this remains conjectural.57 Statue of Neferefre Neferirkares eldest son discovered in his mortuary temple by Paule PosenerKriger.59 Neferirkare and his consort Khentkaus II were in all likelihood the parents of prince Ranefer B the future pharaoh Neferefre.4596061 This relationship is confirmed by a relief on a limestone slab discovered in a house in the village near Abusir62 depicting Neferirkare and his wife Khentkaus with the kings eldest son Ranefernote 363 a name identical with some variants of Neferefres own.64 This indicates that just as for Neferirkare Ranefer was Neferefres name when he was still only a crown prince that is before his accession to the throne.65 Neferirkare and Khentkaus II had at least one other child together the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini.6166 Indeed Neferirkares consort Khentkaus II is known to have been Nyuserres mother since excavations of her mortuary temple yielded a fragmentary relief showing her facing Nyuserre and his family.676869 Remarkably on this relief both Khentkaus and Nyuserre appear on the same scale68 an observation which may be connected with Khentkaus enhanced status during Nyuserres reign as he sought to legitimise his rule following the premature death of Neferefre and the possible challenge by Shepseskare.7071 Further evidence for the filiation of Nyuserre are the location of his pyramid next to that of Neferirkare as well as his reuse for his own valley temple of materials from Neferikares unfinished constructions.72 Yet another son of Neferirkare and Khentkhaus has been proposed73 probably younger74 than both Neferefre and Nyuserre Iryenre a prince irypatnote 4 whose relationship is suggested by the fact that his funerary cult was associated with that of his mother both having taken place in the temple of Khentkaus II.7677 Finally Neferirkare and Khentkaus II may also be the parents of queen Khentkaus III78 whose tomb was discovered in Abusir in 2015. Indeed based on the location and general date for her tomb as well as her titles of kings wife and kings mother Khentkaus III was almost certainly Neferefres consort79 and the mother of either Menkauhor Kaiu or Shepseskare.78 Reignedit Durationedit Manethos Aegyptiaca assigns Neferirkare a reign of 20 years but the archaeological evidence now suggests that this is an overestimate. First the damaged Palermo Stone preserves the year of the 
5 th cattle count for Neferirkares time on the throne.80 The cattle count was an important event aimed at evaluating the amount of taxes to be levied on the population. By the reign of Neferirkare this involved counting cattle oxen and small livestock.81 This event is believed to have been biennial during the Old Kingdom period that is occurring once every two years meaning that Neferirkare reigned at least ten years. Given the shape of the Palermo stone this record must correspond to his final year or be close to it82 so that he ruled no more than eleven years. This is further substantiated by two cursive inscriptions left by masons on stone blocks from the pyramids of Khentkaus II and Neferirkare both of which also date to Neferirkares fifth cattle count its highest known regnal year.8083 Finally Verner has pointed out that a 
20 yearlong reign would be difficult to reconcile with the unfinished state of his pyramid in Abusir.84 Activities in Egyptedit Reconstruction of a ritualnote 5 vase made of sycamore wood with faience and gold inlays showing Neferirkares cartouche and found in his mortuary temple.8528 Now in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin.85 Beyond his construction of a pyramid and sun temple little is known of Neferirkares activities during his time on the throne.86 Some events dating to his first and final years of reign are recorded on the surviving fragments of the Palermo stone878889 a royal annal covering the period from the start of the reign of Menes of the First Dynasty until around the time of Neferirkares rule.note 69192 According to the Palermo stone the future pharaoh Neferirkare then called prince Ranefernote 7 ascended the throne the day after his father Sahures death which occurred on the 
28 th day of the ninth month.9495 The annal then records that in his first year as king Neferirkare granted land to the agricultural estates serving the cults of the Ennead the Souls of Pe and Nekhen and the gods of Keraha.note 89749 To Ra and Hathor he dedicated an offering table provided with 210 daily offerings and ordered the construction of two store rooms and the employment of new dependents in the host temple.97 Neferirkare also commanded the fashioning and opening of the mouth of an electrum statue of the god Ihy escorting it to the mrtchapel of Snefru of the nhtshrine of Hathor.9899 Later in his reign in the year of the fifth cattle count Neferirkare had a bronze statue of himself erected and set up four barques for Ra and Horus in and around his sun temple two of which were of copper. The Souls of Pe and Nekhen and Wadjet received electrum endowments while Ptah was given lands.100 The fact that the Palermo stone terminates90 around Neferirkares rule led some scholars such as Grimal to propose that they might have been compiled during his reign.86 Administrationedit Few specific administrative actions taken by Neferirkare are known. One decree of his inscribed on a limestone slab was excavated in 1903 in Abydos and is now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.15 The decree exempts personnel belonging to a temple of KhentiAmentiu from undertaking compulsory labour in perpetuity under penalty of forfeiture of all property and freedom and be forced to work the fields or in a stone quarry.10110281 This decree indirectly suggests that taxation and compulsory labour was imposed on everybody as a general rule.103 More generally Neferirkares reign saw the growth of the Egyptian administration and priesthood which amassed more power than in earlier reigns although the king remained a living god.4 In particular the positions of viziers and overseer of the expedition that is the highest offices were opened to people from outside the royal family.89 In conjunction with this trend the mastabas of high officials started to become more elaborate with for example chapels including multiple rooms104105 and from the mid to late Fifth Dynasty wide entrance porticoes with columns106 and family tomb complexes.105 It is also at this time that these officials started to record autobiographies on the walls of their tombs.60 Modification of the royal titularyedit The reign of Neferirkare Kakai saw the last107 important modification to the titulary of pharaohs. He was the earliest pharaoh to separate the nswtbjtj King of Upper and Lower Egypt and Z
3 R Son of Ra epithets of the royal titulary. He associated these two epithets with two different independent names the prenomen and nomen respectively. The prenomen or throne name taken by the new king as he ascended the throne was written in a cartouche immediately after the bee and sedge signs for nswtbjtj.107108 From Neferirkares time onwards109 the nomen or birth name was also written in a cartouche110 systematically preceded by the glyphs for Son of Ra an epithet which had seen little use in preceding times.41 Trade and military activitiesedit There is little evidence for military action during Neferirkares reign. William C. Hayes proposed that a few fragmentary limestone statues of kneeling and bound prisoners of war discovered in his mortuary temple111112 possibly attest to punitive raids in Libya to the west or the Sinai and Canaan to the east during his reign.41 The art historian William Stevenson Smith commented that such statues were customary111 elements of the decoration of royal temples and mastabas suggesting that they may not be immediately related to actual military campaigns. Similar statues and small wooden figures of kneeling captives were discovered in the mortuary complexes of Neferefre113 Djedkare Isesi114 Unas115 Teti116 Pepi I117 and Pepi II111 as well as in the tomb of vizier Senedjemib Mehi.118119 Trade relations with Nubia are the only ones attested to during Neferirkares reign.60 The archaeological evidence for this are seal impressions and ostracon bearing his name uncovered in the fortress of Buhen on the second cataract of the Nile.120 Contacts with Byblos on the Levantine coast might also have happened during Neferirkares rule as suggested by a single alabaster bowl inscribed with his name unearthed there.120 Personalityedit Relief showing Ptahshepses found in his mastaba. Neferirkares reign was unusual for the significant number of surviving contemporary records which describe him as a kind and gentle ruler. When Rawer an elderly nobleman and royal courtier was accidentally touched by the kings mace during a religious ceremony
11 a dangerous situation which could have caused this official to be put immediately to death60 or banished from court since the pharaoh was viewed as a living god in Old Kingdom mythologyNeferirkare quickly pardoned Rawer and commanded that no harm should occur to the latter for the incident.121122 As Rawer gratefully states in an inscription from his Giza tomb Now the priest Rawer in his priestly robes was following the steps of the king in order to conduct the royal costume when the sceptre in the kings hand struck the priest Rawers foot. The king said You are safe. So the king said and then It is the kings wish that he be perfectly safe since I have not struck at him. For he is more worthy before the king than any man.23123124 Similarly Neferirkare gave the Priest of Ptah Ptahshepses the unprecedented honour of kissing his feet11125 rather than the ground in front of him.126 Finally when the vizier Washptah suffered a stroke while attending court the king quickly summoned the palaces chief doctors to treat his dying vizier.11 When Washptah died Neferirkare was reportedly inconsolable and retired to his personal quarters to mourn the loss of his friend. The king then ordered the purification of Washptahs body in his presence and ordered an ebony coffin made for the deceased vizier. Washptah was buried with special endowments and rituals courtesy of Neferirkare.127 The records of the kings actions are inscribed in Washptahs tomb itself128 and emphasize Neferirkares humanity towards his subjects.129 Building activitiesedit Pyramid complexedit Main article Pyramid of Neferirkare Pyramidedit The pyramid of Neferirkare Kakai. The Pyramid of Neferirkare Kakai known to the Ancient Egyptians as BaNeferirkare and variously translated as Neferirkare is a Ba130 or Neferirkare takes form5 is located in the royal necropolis of Abusir.131 It is the largest one built during the Fifth Dynasty equalling roughly the size of the Pyramid of Menkaure.5 Workers and artisans who built the pyramid and its surrounding complex lived in pyramid town Neferirkareisthesoul or Kakaiisthesoul located in Abusir.132 The pyramid construction comprised three stages133 first built were six steps28 of rubble their retaining walls made of locally quarried limestone134 indicating that the monument was originally planned to be a step pyramid135136 an unusual design for the time which had not been used since the Third Dynasty some 120 years earlier.28 At this point the pyramid had it been completed would have reached 52 m 171 ft.28 This plan was then altered by a second construction stage with the addition of filling between the steps meant to transform the monument into a true pyramid.136 At a later stage the workers enlarged the pyramid further adding a girdle of masonry and smooth casing stones of red granite.136 This work was never finished135 even after the works implemented by Nyuserre.137 With a square base of 1
08 metrelong 354 ft sides138 the pyramid would have reached 72 m 236 ft high had it been completed.28 Today it is in ruins owing to extensive stone robbing.139 The entrance to the pyramids substructures was located on its north side. There a descending corridor with a gable roof made of limestone beams led into a burial chamber. No pieces of the sarcophagus of the king were found there.136 The pyramid of Neferirkare is surrounded by smaller pyramids and tombs which seem to form an architectural unit the cemetery of his close family.28 This ensemble was meant to be reached from the Nile via a causeway and a valley temple near the river. At the death of Neferirkare only the foundations of both had been laid and Nyuserre later diverted the unfinished causeway to his own pyramid.136 Mortuary templeedit The mortuary temple was far from finished at the death of Neferirkare but it was completed later by his sons Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini using cheap mudbricks and wood rather than stone.140 A significant cache of administrative papyri known as the Abusir papyri was uncovered there by illegal diggers in 1893 and subsequently by Borchardt in 19
03.1 41 Further papyri were also uncovered in the midseventies during a University of Prague Egyptological Institute excavation.86 The presence of this cache is due to the peculiar historical circumstances of the midFifth Dynasty.142 As both Neferirkare and his heir Neferefre died before their pyramid complexes could be finished Nyuserre altered their planned layout diverting the causeway leading to Neferirkares pyramid to his own. This meant that Neferefres and Neferirkares mortuary complexes became somewhat isolated on the Abusir plateau their priests therefore had to live next to the temple premises in makeshift dwellings143 and they stored the administrative records onsite.142 In contrast the records of other temples were kept in the pyramid town close to Sahures or Nyuserres pyramid where the current level of ground water means any papyrus has long since disappeared.144 The Abusir papyri record some details pertaining to Neferirkares mortuary temple. Its central chapel housed a niche with five statues of the king. The central one is described in the papyri as being a representation of the king as Osiris while the first and last ones depicted him as the king of Upper and Lower Egypt respectively.145146 The temple also comprised storerooms for the offerings where numerous stone vesselsnow brokenhad been deposited.147 Finally the papyri indicate that of the four boats included in the mortuary complex two were buried to the north and south of the pyramid one of which was unearthed by Verner.148 During the Late Period of ancient Egypt 664332 BCE the mortuary temple of Neferirkare was used as a secondary cemetery. A gravestone made of yellow calcite was discovered by Borchardt bearing an Aramaic inscription reading Belonging to Nesneu son of Tapakhnum.149 Another inscription150 in Aramaic found on a limestone block and dating to the fifth century BCE reads Mannukinaan son of Sewa.151 Sun templeedit Neferirkare is known from ancient sources to have built a temple to the sun god Ra which is yet to be identified archaeologically.5 It was called Setibrenote 9 meaning Site of the heart of Ra5 and was according to contemporary sources the largest one built during the Fifth Dynasty.4 It is possible that the temple was only built out of mudbricks with a planned completion in stone which had not started when Neferirkare died. In this case it would rapidly have turned into ruins that would be very difficult to locate for archaeologists.153 Alternatively the Egyptologist Rainer Stadelmann has proposed that the Setibre as well as the sun temples of Sahure and Userkaf were one and the same known building that attributed to Userkaf in Abusir.154 This hypothesis has been dispelled in late 2018 thanks to advanced analyses of the verso of the Palermo stone by the Czech Institute of Archeology which enabled the reading of inscriptions mentioning precisely the architecture of the temple as well as lists of donations it received.155 Of all the sun temples built during the Fifth Dynasty the Setibre is the one most commonly cited in ancient sources. Due to this some details of its layout are known it had a large central obelisk an altar and storerooms a sealed barque room housing two boats148 and a hall of the Sed festival. Religious festivals did certainly take place in sun temples as is attested to by the Abusir papyri. In the case of the Setibre the festival of the Night of Ranote 10 is specifically said to have taken place there.157 This was a festival concerned with Ras journey during the night and connected with the ideas of renewal and rebirth that were central to sun temples.156 The temple played an important role in the distribution of food offerings which were brought everyday from there to the mortuary temple of the king.158159160 This journey was made by boat indicating that the Setibre was not adjacent to Neferirkares pyramid. This also underscores the dependent position of the king with respect to Ra as offerings were made to the sun god and then to the deceased king.158 Sun temple of Userkafedit Main article Sun temple of Userkaf The Egyptologist Werner Kaiser proposed based on a study of the evolution of the hieroglyph determinative for sun temple that Neferirkare completed the sun temple of Userkafknown in Ancient Egyptian as Nekhenrenote 
11 sometime around the fifth cattle count of his reign.162163 This opinion is shared by the Egyptologists and archaeologists Ogden Goelet Mark Lehner and Herbert Ricke.164161165 In this hypothesis Neferirkare would have provided the Nekhenre with its monumental obelisk of limestone and red granite.166 Verner and the Egyptologist Paule PosenerKriger have pointed out two difficulties with the hypothesis. Firstly it would imply a long interlude between the two phases of construction of Userkafs temple nearly 25 years between the erection of the temple and that of its obelisk. Secondly they observe that both the pyramid and sun temple of Neferirkare were unfinished at his death raising the question as to why the king would have devoted exceptional effort on a monument of Userkaf when his own still required substantial works to be completed.167168 Instead Verner proposes that it was Sahure who finished the Nekhenre.169 Funerary cultedit Personified agricultural estate of Neferirkare tomb of Sekhemnefer III. As with the other pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty Neferirkare was the object of a funerary cult after his death. Cylinder seals belonging to priests and priestesses serving in this cult attest his existence during the Old Kingdom period. For example a black steatite seal now in the Metropolitan Museum bears the inscription Votary of Hathor and priestess of the good god Neferirkare beloved of the gods.170 Some of these officials had roles in the cults of several kings as well as in their sun temples.171 Offerings for the funerary cult of deceased rulers were provided by dedicated agricultural estates set up during the kings reign. A few of these are known for Neferirkare including The estate of Kakai named the i
3 gt of Kakainote 12 Strong is the power of Kakainote 13 The plantations of Kakainote 14 Nekhbet desires that Kakai lives175 Neferirkare is beloved of the ennead97 and The mansion of the Ba of Neferirkare.97 Traces of the continued existence of the funerary cult of Neferirkare beyond the Old Kingdom period are scant. A pair of statues belonging to a certain Sekhemhotep were uncovered in Giza one of which is inscribed with the standard Ancient Egyptian offering formula followed by of the temple of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Neferirkare true of voice.176 The statues which date to the early 
12 th Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom period are the only archaeological evidence that Neferirkares funerary cult still existed or had been revived around Abusir at the time177178 albeit in a very limited form.179180 Notes references and sourcesedit Notesedit  Proposed dates for Neferirkare Kakais reign 25392527 BCE3 24922482 BCE4567 24832463 BCE8 24772467 BCE9 24752455 BCE1011 24582438 BCE12 24462438 BCE131415 24162407 BCE16 24152405 BCE.17  In this theory Khentkaus I possibly remarried Userkaf after the death of her first husband Shepseskaf46 and became the mother of Sahure and his successor on the throne Neferirkare Kakai.47 This theory is based on the fact that Khentkaus was known to have borne the title of mwt nswt bity nswt bity which could be translated as mother of two kings. Some Egyptologists have therefore proposed that Khentkaus was the mother of Sahure and the historical figure on which the Rededjet of the Westcar Papyrus is based.48 Following the discoveries of Verner and ElAwady in Abusir this theory was abandoned and the role of Khentkaus has been reappraised. In particular it is now understood that there were two queens Khentkaus both of whom may have bore two kings the latest one being the mother of Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini. In addition an ephemeral pharaoh Djedefptah may have ruled between Shepseskaf and Userkaf further troubling the circumstances of the rise of the Fifth Dynasty.46  The transliteration of the inscription is znswt smsw Rnfr.59  Often translated as Hereditary prince or Hereditary noble and more precisely Concerned with the nobility this title denotes a highly exalted position.75  Ludwig Borchardt who discovered this heset vase noticed that the vase was not functional being of plain wood plaster mortar and with no cavity.
