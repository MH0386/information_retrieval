Ptolemy VI the eldest son of King Ptolemy V and Queen Cleopatra I came to the throne aged six when his father died in 180 BC. The kingdom was governed by regents his mother until her death in 178 or 177 BC and then two of her associates Eulaeus and Lenaeus until 169 BC. From 170 BC his sisterwife Cleopatra II and his younger brother Ptolemy VIII were corulers alongside him. Ptolemy VIs reign was characterised by external conflict with the Seleucid Empire over Syria and by internal conflict with his younger brother for control of the Ptolemaic monarchy. In the Sixth Syrian War 170168 BC the Ptolemaic forces were utterly defeated and Egypt was twice invaded by Seleucid armies. A few years after the Seleucid conflict ended Ptolemy VIII succeeded in expelling Ptolemy VI from Egypt in 164 BC. The people of Alexandria turned against Ptolemy VIII and invited Ptolemy VI back to the throne in 163 BC. In this second reign Ptolemy VI was much more successful in his conflicts against the Seleucids and his brother. He banished his brother to Cyrenaica and repeatedly prevented him from using that as a springboard to taking Cyprus despite substantial Roman intervention in Ptolemy VIIIs favour. By supporting a series of rival claimants for the Seleucid throne Ptolemy VI helped instigate a civil war which would continue for generations and eventually consume the Seleucid dynasty. In 145 BC Ptolemy VI invaded Seleucid Syria and won a total victory at the Battle of the Oenoparus which left him in charge of both the Seleucid and Ptolemaic realms. However injuries that he sustained in the battle led to his death three days later. The gains from the war were almost immediately lost and Ptolemy VIII returned to power. Background and early lifeedit Golden ring depicting Ptolemy VI wearing a Greek diadem Ptolemy VI was the eldest son of Ptolemy V and Cleopatra I. The early reign of Ptolemy V was dominated by the Fifth Syrian War 204198 BC against the Seleucid king Antiochus III who completely defeated the Ptolemaic forces annexed CoeleSyria and Judaea to his empire and reduced Egypt to a subordinate position.2 Under a peace treaty Ptolemy V married Antiochus IIIs daughter Cleopatra I in 194 BC.3 Ptolemy VI was born in 186 BC probably in May or June.note 11 He had two siblings a sister Cleopatra II who was probably born between 186 and 184 BC and a younger brother Ptolemy VIII. His father advertised Ptolemy VIs position as heir within Egypt and to the wider world for example by entering a chariot team under his name in the Panathenaic Games of 182 BC.41 The defeat in the Fifth Syrian War cast a shadow over the rest of Ptolemy Vs reign. One prominent faction within the Ptolemaic court agitated for a return to war in order to restore Egyptian prestige while another faction resisted the expense involved in rebuilding and remilitarising the realm.2 Ptolemy V died unexpectedly in September 180 BC at the age of only 30. It is possible that he was murdered as a result of this factional infighting  a late source claims that he had been poisoned.5 First reign 180164 BCedit Regenciesedit Ptolemy VI who was only six years old was immediately crowned king with his mother Cleopatra I as coregent. In documents from this period Cleopatra I is named before Ptolemy VI and coins were minted under the joint authority of her and her son.1 In the face of continued agitation for war with the Seleucids Cleopatra I pursued a peaceful policy because of her own Seleucid roots and because a war would have threatened her hold on power.67 She probably died in late 178 or early 177 BC though some scholars place her death in late 176 BC.3 Ptolemy VI was still too young to rule on his own. On her deathbed Cleopatra I appointed Eulaeus and Lenaeus two of her close associates as regents. Eulaeus a eunuch who had been Ptolemy VIs tutor was the more senior of the two even minting coinage in his own name. Lenaeus was a Syrian slave who had probably come to Egypt as part of Cleopatra Is retinue when she got married. He seems to have been specifically in charge of managing the kingdoms finances.8 Eulaeus and Lenaeus sought to reinforce their authority by augmenting the dignity of Ptolemy VI. In early 175 BC they arranged his marriage to his sister Cleopatra II. Brothersister marriage was traditional in the Ptolemaic dynasty and was probably adopted in imitation of earlier Egyptian Pharaohs.9 The couple were incorporated into the Ptolemaic dynastic cult as the Theoi Philometores the Motherloving Gods named in honour of the deceased Cleopatra I.1 In Egyptian religious contexts the title recalled the relationship of the Pharaoh as Horus to his mother Isis.10 Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II were still young children so the marriage was not consummated for many years they would eventually have at least four children together. Sixth Syrian War 170 BC168 BCedit Antiochus IV Main article Sixth Syrian War The Seleucid king Seleucus IV Ptolemy VIs uncle had followed a generally peaceful policy but he was murdered in 175 BC. After two months of conflict his brother Antiochus IV secured the throne.11 The unsettled situation empowered the warhawks in the Ptolemaic court and Eulaeus and Lenaeus were unable or unwilling to resist them with Cleopatra I no longer alive. By 172 BC preparations for war were underway.12 Rome and Macedon commenced the Third Macedonian War in 171 BC lessening their ability to interfere with Ptolemaic affairs and the Egyptian government considered the moment for war had come.1314 In October 170 BC Ptolemy VIII was promoted to the status of coregent alongside his brother and sister. The current year was declared the first year of a new era.115 John Grainger argues that the two brothers had become the figureheads for separate factions at court and that these ceremonies were intended to promote unity within the court in the runup to war.16 Shortly afterwards Ptolemy VI now around sixteen was declared an adult and celebrated his comingofage ceremony the anakleteria.17181 He was now ostensibly ruling in his own right although in practice Eulaeus and Lenaeus remained in charge of the government. The Sixth Syrian War broke out shortly after this probably in early 169 BC.1918 The Ptolemaic army set out from the border fort of Pelusium to invade Palestine but was intercepted and defeated by Antiochus IVs army in the Sinai.20 Antiochus seized Pelusium and then pursued the Egyptians who had withdrawn to the Nile Delta.2122 This defeat led to the collapse of the Ptolemaic government in Alexandria. Eulaeus attempted to send Ptolemy VI to the Aegean island of Samothrace with the Ptolemaic treasury.23 Before this could happen two prominent Ptolemaic generals Comanus and Cineas launched a military coup and took control of the Egyptian government.24 As Antiochus IV advanced on Alexandria Ptolemy VI went out to meet him. They negotiated an agreement of friendship which in effect reduced Ptolemy VI to a Seleucid client.2526 When news of the agreement reached Alexandria the people of the city rioted. Comanus and Cineas rejected the agreement and Ptolemy VIs authority declaring Ptolemy VIII the sole king Cleopatra IIs position remained unchanged.2728 Antiochus IV responded by placing Alexandria under siege but he was unable to take the city and withdrew from Egypt in September 169 BC as winter approached leaving Ptolemy VI as his puppet king in Memphis and retaining a garrison in Pelusium.2930 Within two months Ptolemy VI had reconciled with Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra II and returned to Alexandria. The restored government repudiated the agreement that Ptolemy VI had made with Antiochus IV and began to recruit new troops from Greece.3132 In response Antiochus IV invaded Egypt for a second time in the spring of 168 BC. Officially this invasion was presented as an effort to restore Ptolemy VIs position against his younger brother.33 Antiochus IV quickly occupied Memphis where he was crowned king of Egypt and advanced on Alexandria.34 However the Ptolemies had appealed to Rome for help over the winter a Roman embassy led by Gaius Popillius Laenas confronted Antiochus IV at the town of Eleusis and forced him to agree to a settlement bringing the war to an end.353637 Rebellions and expulsion 168164 BCedit The joint rule of the two brothers and Cleopatra II continued in the immediate aftermath of the war. However the complete failure of the Egyptian forces had left the Ptolemaic monarchys prestige seriously diminished and caused a permanent rift between Ptolemy VI and Ptolemy VIII.38 In 165 BC Dionysius Petosarapis a prominent courtier who appears to have been of native Egyptian origin attempted to exploit the conflict in order to take control of the government. He went to the stadium and announced to the people of Alexandria that Ptolemy VI was plotting to assassinate Ptolemy VIII. Ptolemy VI managed to convince his younger brother that the charges were untrue and the two kings appeared together in the stadium defusing the crisis. Dionysius fled the city and convinced some military contingents to mutiny.39 Heavy fighting took place in the Fayyum over the next year.404138 Another apparently unrelated rebellion broke out simultaneously in the Thebaid the latest in a series of native Egyptian uprisings against Ptolemaic rule. Ptolemy VI successfully suppressed the rebellion after a bitter siege at Panopolis.42404338 Owing to the preceding years of conflict many farms had been abandoned threatening the governments agricultural revenue. In autumn 165 BC the Ptolemies issued a royal decree On Agriculture which attempted to force land back into cultivation. The measure was very unpopular and prompted widespread protests.44 A new branch of government the Idios Logos Special Account was established to manage estates that had become royal property as a result of confiscation or abandonment.45 Late in 164 BC1 probably not long after Ptolemy VI had returned from the south Ptolemy VIII who was now about twenty years old somehow expelled Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II from power  the exact course of events is not known. Ptolemy VI fled to Rome for help traveling with only a eunuch and three servants. In Rome he seems to have received nothing and for accommodation had a poor room in an attic offered by and shared with a painter of personal acquaintance.46 From there he moved on to Cyprus which remained under his control.47 Second reign 163145 BCedit In summer 163 BC the people of Alexandria rioted against Ptolemy VIII expelling him in turn and recalling Ptolemy VI. The restored king decided to come to an agreement with his younger brother and granted him control of Cyrenaica. This may have been done at the instigation of a pair of Roman agents present in Alexandria at the time. Egypt fell under the joint rule of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II they were mentioned together in all official documents. This system of corule which would be the norm for most of the rest of the Ptolemaic dynasty was inaugurated by an amnesty decree and a royal visit to Memphis to celebrate the Egyptian new year festival.48 Conflicts with Ptolemy VIII and the Seleucidsedit Coin of Ptolemy VIII Ring of Ptolemy VI as Egyptian pharaoh Louvre Ptolemy VIII was not satisfied with Cyrenaica and went to Rome in late 163 or early 162 BC to request help. The Roman Senate agreed that the division was unfair declaring that Ptolemy VIII ought to receive Cyprus as well. Titus Manlius Torquatus and Gnaeus Cornelius Merula were sent as envoys to force Ptolemy VI to concede this but he procrastinated and obfuscated. On their return to Rome at the end of 162 BC they convinced the Senate to abandon their alliance with Ptolemy VI and to grant Ptolemy VIII permission to use force to take control of Cyprus.4950 The Senate offered him no actual support in this endeavour and Cyprus remained in Ptolemy VIs hands.515253 In 162 BC Ptolemy VI was also involved in a scheme to destabilise the Seleucid kingdom. His agents in Rome helped the kings cousin Demetrius I escape from captivity and return to Syria to seize control of the Seleucid empire from the underage king Antiochus V. Once Demetrius I was in power however their interests began to diverge and the prospect of war between the two kingdoms returned.54 In 158 or 154 BC Ptolemy VIs governor of Cyprus Archias attempted to sell the island to Demetrius I for 500 talents but he was caught and hanged himself before this plot came to fruition.555657 In 154 BC after surviving an assassination attempt which he blamed on his brother Ptolemy VIII again appealed for assistance against Ptolemy VI to the Roman Senate. The Senate agreed to send a second embassy led by Gnaeus Cornelius Merula and Lucius Minucius Thermus equipped with troops in order to enforce the transfer of Cyprus to his control.58 In response Ptolemy VI besieged his younger brother at Lapethus and captured him with the help of the Cretan League.59 He persuaded Ptolemy VIII to withdraw from Cyprus in exchange for continued possession of Cyrenaica an annual payment of grain and a promise of marriage to one of his infant daughters probably Cleopatra Thea once she came of age.606162 As a result of the conflict with his brother Ptolemy VI made particular efforts to advance his eldest son Ptolemy Eupator as heir. The young prince was made priest of Alexander and the royal cult in 158 BC when he was only eight years old. At age fourteen in spring 152 BC Ptolemy Eupator was promoted to full coregent alongside his parents but he died in autumn of the same year. This left the succession very uncertain since Ptolemy VIs remaining son was very young. He began advancing his daughter Cleopatra III formally deifying her in 146 BC. Intervention in Syria 152145 BCedit Coin of Alexander Balas A new claimant to the Seleucid throne Alexander Balas appeared in 153 BC. John Grainger proposes that Ptolemy VI provided Alexander with financial backing naval transport and secured Ptolemais Akko as a landing base for him. He argues that Alexanders chancellor Ammonius should be seen as a Ptolemaic agent.63 There is however no explicit evidence for this and Boris Chrubasik presents Alexanders initial successes as accomplished without any Ptolemaic involvement and challenges the identification of Ammonius as an Egyptian in particular. At any rate an agreement between Ptolemy VI and Alexander was sealed in 150 BC when Ptolemy VI married his teenage daughter Cleopatra Thea to Alexander in a ceremony at Ptolemais Akko.646566 Coin of Demetrius II By May 146 BC however Ptolemy VI was gathering troops. In 145 BC he invaded Syria while Alexander was putting down a rebellion in Cilicia. Alexanders vassal Jonathan Maccabee allowed Ptolemy VI to pass through Judaea without interference. Ostensibly Ptolemy VI acted in support of Alexander against the latest claimant of the Seleucid throne Demetrius II. In practice Ptolemy VIs intervention came at a heavy cost he took control of all the Seleucid cities along the coast including Seleucia Pieria.67 He may also have started minting his own coinage in the Syrian cities.686569 While he was at Ptolemais Akko however Ptolemy VI switched sides. According to Josephus he discovered a plot against his life by Alexanders chancellor Ammonius. When Ptolemy VI demanded that Ammonius be punished Alexander refused.70 Ptolemy VI remarried his daughter to Demetrius II and continued his march northward. The commanders of Antioch Diodotus and Hierax surrendered the city to Ptolemy and crowned him king of Asia. For a short period documents referred to him as King of Egypt and Asia and he initiated a double regnal count with his Egyptian Year 36  his Syrian Year 1. However fearing that a unification of the Ptolemaic and Seleucid kingdoms would lead to Roman intervention Ptolemy VI decided to abandon the title. Instead he limited himself to annexing Coele Syria and pledged to serve as a tutor in goodness and guide to Demetrius II.716569 Alexander returned from Cilicia with his army but Ptolemy VI and Demetrius II defeated his forces at the Oenoparas river.72 Alexander then fled to Arabia where he was killed. His severed head was brought to Ptolemy VI. For the first time since the death of Alexander the Great Egypt and Syria were united. However Ptolemy VI had been wounded in the battle and he died three days later.73 By late 145 Demetrius II had expelled all Ptolemaic troops from Syria and reasserted Seleucid control by leading his own forces all the way down to the Egyptian border.7475 Ptolemy VI seems to have intended for his sevenyearold son also named Ptolemy to succeed him but instead the Alexandrians invited Ptolemy VIII to assume the throne. Young Ptolemy was eventually eliminated by his uncle apparently only after 143 BC when he served as eponymous priest and perhaps as late as 1321 BC.76 Regimeedit Pharaonic ideology and Egyptian religionedit Depiction of Ptolemy VI as pharaoh found in the sea near Aegina Like his predecessors Ptolemy VI fully embraced his role as pharaoh and maintained a mutually beneficial relationship with the traditional Egyptian priesthood. In particular he maintained close ties with the worship of Ptah and Apis at Memphis. Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II seem to have visited Memphis and stayed in the Serapeum there for the Egyptian New Year festival every year. During these visits Ptolemy VI personally made the ritual temple offerings expected of the pharaoh.47 In summer 161 BC Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II gathered a synod of all the priests of Egypt in order to pass a decree granting tax relief and other benefactions to the priests in exchange for cultic honours in Egyptian temples  part of a series of decrees that had been issued under each of his predecessors going back to Ptolemy III. The decree survives only on one fragmentary stele known as CG 221
84.7 747 Other inscriptions record specific benefactions made at various points during the reign. In September 157 BC Ptolemy VI affirmed the grant of all the tax revenue from the Dodecaschoenus region to the Temple of Isis at Philae first made by his predecessor. The grant is recorded in the Dodecaschoenus decree. Around 145 BC he granted the tribute from a Nubian leader to the priests of Mandulis at Philae.78 Relations with the Jewsedit The Jewish historian Josephus emphasises Ptolemy VIs personal interest in the Jews and their wellbeing.79 There had been a Jewish community in Egypt since at least the fifth century BC and it had grown significantly since the establishment of Ptolemaic control over Jerusalem in 311 BC. By Ptolemy VIs reign Jews had long been incorporated into the Ptolemaic army and they enjoyed various privileges comparable to those possessed by Greeks and Macedonians in Egypt. A large group of new Jewish immigrants arrived in Egypt in the 1
60 s BC fleeing civil conflict with the Maccabees. This group was led by Onias IV son of a former high priest who had been deposed by the Seleucids. Ptolemy VI permitted them to settle at Leontopolis which became known as the Land of Onias and to establish a temple with Onias as High Priest.80 The place is still known as Tell alJahudija Hill of the Jews today. Onias was also granted an important military position and his family became prominent members of the royal court. In Alexandria the Jews had their own quarter of the city with its own politeuma  a kind of selfgoverning community within the city led by their own ethnarch. It is likely that this politeuma was established under Ptolemy VI.81 Relations with Nubiaedit Stele of Ptolemy VI at Philae recording the grant of tax revenues to the Temple of Isis Until the reign of Ptolemy IV the Ptolemies had controlled the region south of Aswan to the second cataract which was known as the Triacontaschoenus or Lower Nubia and included rich gold mines. Throughout the 1
60 s and 1
50 s BC Ptolemy VI reasserted Ptolemaic control over the northern part of Nubia. This achievement is heavily advertised at the Temple of Isis at Philae which was granted the tax revenues of the Dodecaschoenus region in 157 BC. Decorations on the first pylon of the Temple of Isis at Philae emphasise the Ptolemaic claim to rule the whole of Nubia. The aforementioned inscription regarding the priests of Mandulis shows that some Nubian leaders at least were paying tribute to the Ptolemaic treasury in this period. In order to secure the region the strategos of Upper Egypt Boethus founded two new cities named Philometris and Cleopatra in honour of the royal couple.827853 Marriage and issueedit Ptolemy VI and his sisterwife Cleopatra II had the following issue Name Image Birth Death Notes Ptolemy Eupator 15 October 166 BC August 152 BC Briefly coregent with his father in 152 BC.
