2 O.4 It is widely mined and is used as a fertilizer and as the main constituent in many forms of plaster drywall and blackboard or sidewalk chalk.5678 Gypsum also crystallizes as translucent crystals of selenite. It forms as an evaporite mineral and as a hydration product of anhydrite. The Mohs scale of mineral hardness defines gypsum as hardness value 2 based on scratch hardness comparison. Finegrained white or lightly tinted forms of gypsum known as alabaster have been used for sculpture by many cultures including Ancient Egypt Mesopotamia Ancient Rome the Byzantine Empire and the Nottingham alabasters of Medieval England. Etymology and historyedit The word gypsum is derived from the Greek word  gypsos plaster.9 Because the quarries of the Montmartre district of Paris have long furnished burnt gypsum calcined gypsum used for various purposes this dehydrated gypsum became known as plaster of Paris. Upon adding water after a few dozen minutes plaster of Paris becomes regular gypsum dihydrate again causing the material to harden or set in ways that are useful for casting and construction.10 Gypsum was known in Old English as sprstn spear stone referring to its crystalline projections. Thus the word spar in mineralogy by comparison to gypsum refers to any nonore mineral or crystal that forms in spearlike projections. In the mid
18 th century the German clergyman and agriculturalist Johann Friderich Mayer investigated and publicized gypsums use as a fertilizer.11 Gypsum may act as a source of sulfur for plant growth and in the early 
19 th century it was regarded as an almost miraculous fertilizer. American farmers were so anxious to acquire it that a lively smuggling trade with Nova Scotia evolved resulting in the socalled Plaster War of 18
20.1 2 Physical propertiesedit Gypsum crystals are soft enough to bend under pressure of the hand. Sample on display at Muse cantonal de gologie de Lausanne. Gypsum is moderately watersoluble 
2.0 
2.5  gL at 25 C13 and in contrast to most other salts it exhibits retrograde solubility becoming less soluble at higher temperatures. When gypsum is heated in air it loses water and converts first to calcium sulfate hemihydrate bassanite often simply called plaster and if heated further to anhydrous calcium sulfate anhydrite. As with anhydrite the solubility of gypsum in saline solutions and in brines is also strongly dependent on NaCl common table salt concentration.13 The structure of gypsum consists of layers of calcium Ca2 and sulfate  SO24 ions tightly bound together. These layers are bonded by sheets of anion water molecules via weaker hydrogen bonding which gives the crystal perfect cleavage along the sheets in the 010 plane.414 Crystal varietiesedit Main article Selenite mineral Gypsum occurs in nature as flattened and often twinned crystals and transparent cleavable masses called selenite. Selenite contains no significant selenium rather both substances were named for the ancient Greek word for the Moon. Selenite may also occur in a silky fibrous form in which case it is commonly called satin spar. Finally it may also be granular or quite compact. In handsized samples it can be anywhere from transparent to opaque. A very finegrained white or lightly tinted variety of gypsum called alabaster is prized for ornamental work of various sorts. In arid areas gypsum can occur in a flowerlike form typically opaque with embedded sand grains called desert rose. It also forms some of the largest crystals found in nature up to 12 m 39 ft long in the form of selenite.15 Occurrenceedit Gypsum is a common mineral with thick and extensive evaporite beds in association with sedimentary rocks. Deposits are known to occur in strata from as far back as the Archaean eon.16 Gypsum is deposited from lake and sea water as well as in hot springs from volcanic vapors and sulfate solutions in veins. Hydrothermal anhydrite in veins is commonly hydrated to gypsum by groundwater in nearsurface exposures. It is often associated with the minerals halite and sulfur. Gypsum is the most common sulfate mineral.17 Pure gypsum is white but other substances found as impurities may give a wide range of colors to local deposits. Because gypsum dissolves over time in water gypsum is rarely found in the form of sand. However the unique conditions of the White Sands National Park in the US state of New Mexico have created a 710 km2 270 sq mi expanse of white gypsum sand enough to supply the US construction industry with drywall for 1000 years.18 Commercial exploitation of the area strongly opposed by area residents was permanently prevented in 1933 when President Herbert Hoover declared the gypsum dunes a protected national monument. Gypsum is also formed as a byproduct of sulfide oxidation amongst others by pyrite oxidation when the sulfuric acid generated reacts with calcium carbonate. Its presence indicates oxidizing conditions. Under reducing conditions the sulfates it contains can be reduced back to sulfide by sulfatereducing bacteria. This can lead to accumulation of elemental sulfur in oilbearing formations19 such as salt domes20 where it can be mined using the Frasch process21 Electric power stations burning coal with flue gas desulfurization produce large quantities of gypsum as a byproduct from the scrubbers. Orbital pictures from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter MRO have indicated the existence of gypsum dunes in the northern polar region of Mars22 which were later confirmed at ground level by the Mars Exploration Rover MER Opportunity.23 Large gypsum crystals in Lechuguilla Caves chandelier ballroom Gypsum crystals in the Cave of the Crystals in Mexico person at lower right for scale Gypsum crystals formed as the water evaporated in Lake Lucero White Sands National Park Gypsum veins in the siltsmarls of the Tea Green and Grey Marls Blue Anchor Somerset United Kingdom Gypsum veins in Caprock Canyons State Park and Trailway Texas Dunes made of small crystals of gypsum White Sands National Park Miningedit Estimated production of Gypsum in 2015 thousand metric tons24 Country Production Reserves China 132000  Iran 22000 1600 Thailand 12500  United States 11500 700000 Turkey 10000  Spain 6400  Mexico 5300  Japan 5000  Russia 4500  Italy 4100  India 3500 39000 Australia 3500  Oman 3500  Brazil 3300 290000 France 3300  Canada 2700 450000 Saudi Arabia 2400  Algeria 2200  Germany 1800 450000 Argentina 1400  Pakistan 1300  United Kingdom 1200 55000 Other countries 15000  World total 258000  Commercial quantities of gypsum are found in the cities of Araripina and Graja in Brazil in Pakistan Jamaica Iran worlds second largest producer Thailand Spain the main producer in Europe Germany Italy England Ireland Canada25 and the United States. Large open pit quarries are located in many places including Fort Dodge Iowa which sits on one of the largest deposits of gypsum in the world26 and Plaster City California United States and East Kutai Kalimantan Indonesia. Several small mines also exist in places such as Kalannie in Western Australia where gypsum is sold to private buyers for additions of calcium and sulfur as well as reduction of aluminum toxicities on soil for agricultural purposes. Crystals of gypsum up to 11 m 36 ft long have been found in the caves of the Naica Mine of Chihuahua Mexico. The crystals thrived in the caves extremely rare and stable natural environment. Temperatures stayed at 58 C 136 F and the cave was filled with mineralrich water that drove the crystals growth. The largest of those crystals weighs 55 tonnes 61 short tons and is around 500000 years old.27 Golden gypsum crystals from Winnipeg Gypsum sand from White Sands National Park New Mexico Synthesisedit Synthetic gypsum is produced as a waste product or byproduct in a range of industrial processes. Desulfurizationedit Flue gas desulfurization gypsum FGDG is recovered at some coalfired power plants. The main contaminants are Mg K Cl F B Al Fe Si and Se. They come both from the limestone used in desulfurization and from the coal burned. This product is pure enough to replace natural gypsum in a wide variety of fields including drywalls water treatment and cement set retarder. Improvements in flue gas desulfurization have greatly reduced the amount of toxic elements present.28 Desalinationedit Gypsum precipitates onto brackish water membranes a phenomenon known as mineral salt scaling such as during brackish water desalination of water with high concentrations of calcium and sulfate. Scaling decreases membrane life and productivity.29 This is one of the main obstacles in brackish water membrane desalination processes such as reverse osmosis or nanofiltration. Other forms of scaling such as calcite scaling depending on the water source can also be important considerations in distillation as well as in heat exchangers where either the salt solubility or concentration can change rapidly. A new study has suggested that the formation of gypsum starts as tiny crystals of a mineral called bassanite

4 H
2 O.30 This process occurs via a threestage pathway homogeneous nucleation of nanocrystalline bassanite selfassembly of bassanite into aggregates and transformation of bassanite into gypsum. Refinery wasteedit The production of phosphate fertilizers requires breaking down calciumcontaining phosphate rock with acid producing calcium sulfate waste known as phosphogypsum PG. This form of gypsum is contaminated by impurities found in the rock namely fluoride silica radioactive elements such as radium and heavy metal elements such as cadmium.31 Similarly production of titanium dioxide produces titanium gypsum TG due to neutralization of excess acid with lime. The product is contaminated with silica fluorides organic matters and alkalis.32 Impurities in refinery gypsum waste have in many cases prevented them from being used as normal gypsum in fields such as construction. As a result waste gypsum is stored in stacks indefinitely with significant risk of leaching their contaminants into water and soil.31 To reduce the accumulation and ultimately clear out these stacks research is underway to find more applications for such waste products.32 Occupational safetyedit NFPA 704 fire diamond 33 0 0 0 Gypsum People can be exposed to gypsum in the workplace by breathing it in skin contact and eye contact. Calcium sulfate per se is nontoxic and is even approved as a food additive34 but as powdered gypsum it can irritate skin and mucous membranes.35 United Statesedit The Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for gypsum exposure in the workplace as TWA 15 mgm3 for total exposure and TWA 5 mgm3 for respiratory exposure over an eighthour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has set a recommended exposure limit REL of TWA 10 mgm3 for total exposure and TWA 5 mgm3 for respiratory exposure over an eighthour workday.35 Usesedit Gypsum works Valencian Museum of Ethnology Old Alfarb kiln for making plaster as a construction material British Gypsum Kirkby Thore Map of gypsum deposits in northern Ohio black squares indicate the location of deposits from Geography of Ohio 1923 Gypsum is used in a wide variety of applications Construction industryedit Gypsum board36 is primarily used as a finish for walls and ceilings and is known in construction as plasterboard sheetrock or drywall. Gypsum provides a degree of fireresistance to these materials and glass fibers are added to their composition to accentuate this effect. Gypsum has little heat conductivity giving its plaster some insulative properties.37 Gypsum blocks are used like concrete blocks in building construction. Gypsum mortar is an ancient mortar used in building construction. A component of Portland cement used to prevent flash setting too rapid hardening of concrete. A wood substitute in the ancient world For example when wood became scarce due to deforestation on Bronze Age Crete gypsum was employed in building construction at locations where wood was previously used.38 Agricultureedit Fertilizer In the late 
18 th and early 
19 th centuries Nova Scotia gypsum often referred to as plaster was a highly sought fertilizer for wheat fields in the United States.39 Gypsum provides two of the secondary plant macronutrients calcium and sulfur. Unlike limestone it generally does not affect soil pH.40 Reclamation of saline soils regardless of pH. When gypsum is added to sodic saline and acidic soil the highly soluble form of boron sodium metaborate is converted to the less soluble calcium metaborate. Exchangeable sodium percentage is also reduced by gypsum application.4142 The Zuiderzee Works uses gypsum for the recovered land.43 Other soil conditioner uses Gypsum reduces aluminium and boron toxicity in acidic soils. It also improves soil structure improving water absorption and aeration.40 Soil water potential monitoring a gypsum block can be inserted into soil its electrical resistance measured to derive soil moisture.44 Modeling sculpture and artedit Plaster for casting moulds and modeling. As alabaster a material for sculpture it was used especially in the ancient world before steel was developed when its relative softness made it much easier to carve.45 During the Middle Ages and Renaissance it was preferred even to marble.46 In the medieval period scribes and illuminators used it as an ingredient in gesso which was applied to illuminated letters and gilded with gold in illuminated manuscripts.47 Food and drinkedit A tofu soy bean curd coagulant making it ultimately a significant source of dietary calcium.48 Adding hardness to water used for brewing.49 Used in baking as a dough conditioner reducing stickiness and as a bakedgoods source of dietary calcium.50 The primary component of mineral yeast food.51 Used in mushroom cultivation to stop grains from clumping together. Medicine and cosmeticsedit Plaster for surgical splints.52 Impression plasters in dentistry.53 Otheredit An alternative to iron oxide in some thermite mixes.54 Tests have shown that gypsum can be used to remove pollutants such as lead55 or arsenic5657 from contaminated waters.
