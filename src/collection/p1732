26 th Dynasty Wahibre Psamtik I Ancient Egyptian WjbR Psmk was the first pharaoh of the Twentysixth Dynasty of Egypt the Saite period ruling from the city of Sais in the Nile delta between 664610 BC. He was installed by Ashurbanipal of the NeoAssyrian Empire against the Kushite rulers of the Twentyfifth Dynasty but later gained more autonomy as the Assyrian Empire declined. Nameedit The Egyptian name psmk pronounced as Psamk5 was a short form of psnmk meaning the man of Meek with Meek presumably a deity.6 His name was rendered by the Assyrians as Pishamilki Akkadian Piamilki7 by the Ancient Greeks as Psammtikhos  and by the Romans as Psammtichus. Psamtik was also called Nabushezibanni Akkadian and 8 Nabuezibanni meaning O Nabu save me9 by the Assyrians. Backgroundedit See also Assyrian conquest of Egypt Assyrian capture of an Egyptian city from the Kushite Pharaoh Taharqa or Tantamani possibly Memphis in 663 BCE. British Museum.10 In 671 BCE the Assyrian king Esarhaddon invaded Egypt. This invasion was directed against the Kushite rulers of the Twentyfifth Dynasty of Egypt who had been in control of Upper Egypt rather than against the native Egyptian rulers. The Assyrians created an administration relying on local Egyptian rulers and put in place the twelve kinglets who formed a Dodecarchy ruling over the Nile Delta. They also formed alliances with the ruler of the city of Sais Necho I who was the most powerful of the Delta kinglets as well as with Pakruru the ruler of the important nome of PerSopdu.11 In 665 BCE the Kushite king Tantamani invaded Lower Egypt again and Necho I and Pakruru resisted the Kushite attack. Necho I died in battle and his son Psamtik I fled to Syria while Pakruru became the spokesperson of the Delta kinglets during the peace negotiations with Tantamani at Memphis.11 The next year in 664 BCE the Assyrians under Esarhaddons son Ashurbanipal invaded Egypt again and the Assyrian army retook Memphis proceeded with the Sack of Thebes and expelled Tantamani from Egypt. Necho Is son Psamtik I returned to Egypt with this invading force was installed by the Assyrians as the ruler of Sais and Memphis and concluded with the Assyrians an ad agreement some type of superiorinferior relation but none of the Assyrian sources details the arrangements.11 Reignedit For the first two years of his reign Psamtik I ruled in conformity with the arrangement implemented by the Assyrians in Egypt as one of many vassal kinglets of the Egyptian Dodecarchy. According to Herodotus during this period Psamtik unwittingly fulfilled a prophecy by an oracle which promised the kingship of all Egypt to whoever poured a libation from a bronze vessel after which the other kinglets of the Docecarchy chased him from Memphis of which he lost the rule and he had to flee into the swamps of the Nile Delta.11 Egyptian ruler Psamtik I during the fall of Ashdod in 635 BCE illustration by Patrick Gray 1900. 
7 th century statue found in Kale mentioning Psamtik I. The Ionian Greek inscription reads Amphimeos son Pedon brought me from Egypt and gave as a votive Psammetichos the king of Egypt gave him a city for his virtue and a golden diadem for his virtue.1213 After being chased from Memphis Psamtik I received another similar prophecy from the goddess Wadjet of Buto who promised him the rule over all Egypt should he employ bronze men from the sea. Beginning in 662 BCE Psamtik I formed contacts with Gyges the king of the Anatolian kingdom of Lydia who sent to Egypt the Ionian Greek and Carian mercenaries that Psamtik I used to reconquer Memphis and defeat the other kinglets of the Dodecarchy some of whom fled to Libya. Psamtik I might have been also aided in these military campaigns by Arabs from the Sinai Peninsula.11 After having eliminated all his rivals Psamtik I reorganized these mercenaries and placed them in key garrisons at Daphnae in the East and Elephantine in the South to prevent a possible Kushite attack and to control trade.11 This military aid from Lydia lasted until 658 BCE at which point Gyges faced an impending Cimmerian invasion.14 By Psamtik Is 
4 th regnal year he completed the forging of an alliance with the powerful family of the Masters of Shipping from Heracleopolis and by his 
8 th regnal year in 657 BCE he was in full control of the Delta.11 Interpretations of Psamtik Is wars as an alliance between Sais and Lydia against Assyria appear to be inaccurate despite negative attitudes of the Assyrians towards Gygess and Psamtiks actions.11 The Assyrians had risen Sais into preeminence in Egypt after expelling the Saites Kushite enemies from the country but Psamtik I and Ashurbanipal had signed a treaty with each other and no hostilities between them is recorded. Thus Psamtik I and Ashurbanipal had remained allies ever since the former had been put in power with Assyrian military support. The participation of the Arab tribes of the Sinai who were Assyrian vassals further attest to the lack of enmity between Sais and Assyria at this period and the silence of Assyrian sources concerning Psamtik Is expansion imply there was no hostility whether overt or covert between Assyria and Sais during Psamtik Is unification of Egypt under his rule.1411 Likewise Gygess military support of Psamtik I was not directed against Assyria and is not mentioned as hostile to Assyria or allied with other countries against Assyria in Assyrian records the Assyrian disapproval of Gygess support for Psamtik I was primarily motivated by Gygess refusal to form an alliance with Assyria and his undertaking of these actions independently of Assyria which the Assyrians interpreted as an act of arrogance rather than by the support itself.1411 Psamtik Is campaigns were not directed against Assyrian power and appear to have been conducted only against the rival kinglets of the Delta and Ashurbanipals disapproval of his actions were motivated not by his claim of kingship over Egypt but by his revocation of the ad agreement between the two kings as well as by Psamtik Is elimination of the other kinglets allied to Assyria especially Pakruru of PerSopdu and arruldri since Ashurbanipal was aware that he had to rely on those kinglets to maintain Assyrian power in Egypt.11 In Psamtik Is 
9 th regnal year in 656 BCE he sent an expedition to the city of Thebes which compelled the existing Gods Wife of Amun Shepenupet II daughter of the former Kushite Pharaoh Piye to adopt his daughter Nitocris I as her heiress in the socalled Adoption Stela. This was concluded with the approval of the Theban aristocracy and the tacit support of Mentuemhat who was the Fourth Priest of Amun and the Mayor of Thebes. Psamtik I had unified all of Egypt under his rule.11 In 655 and 654 BCE that is his 
10 th and 
11 th regnal years Psamtik I carried out a war with Libyan tribes who had seized control of the area from the Oxyrhynchite nome around the Bahr Yussef till the Mediterranean Sea and who had been joined by Psamtik Is previously defeated enemies from his wars in the Delta. Following the successful conclusion of this war Psamtik I placed an Egyptian garrison at Marea to prevent incursions by Libyans from the desert. Thus by the end of his first decade of rule in 654 BCE Psamtik I was firmly in control of all Egypt.11 According to Herodotus Psamtik carried out a twentynine year siege of Ashdod.15 The exact dating of this siege is uncertain.16 In the later part of Psamtik Is reign the NeoAssyrian Empire started unravelling following the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC leaving a power vacuum in the Levant which allowed the Assyrians former Scythian vassals to overrun the area. Some time between 623 and 616 BCE the Scythians reached as far south as Judah and Edom until Psamtik I met them and convinced them to turn back by offering them gifts.16 Following the encounter with the Scythians Psamtik expanded his military operations through the Via Maris into the Levant to support the collapsing Assyrian Empire against the Medes Babylonians Scythians and Chaldeans who had revolted against it. Psamtik Is intervention implied that an alliance had already been concluded between him and the NeoAssyrian Empire although it is unknown whether it was a new alliance between him and the new Assyrian king Sinsharishkun or a renewal of the old alliance signed when Psamtik I had been enthroned by the Assyrian army as king of Sais in 664 BCE.16 Psamtik died in 610 BCE and was succeeded by his son Necho II. Investigation into the origin of language edit Legend of the linguistic experiment by Psamtik I. The Greek historian Herodotus conveyed an anecdote about Psamtik in the second volume of his Histories 
2.2 . During his visit to Egypt Herodotus heard that Psammetichus Psamik sought to discover the origin of language by conducting an experiment with two children. Allegedly he gave two newborn babies to a shepherd with the instructions that no one should speak to them but that the shepherd should feed and care for them while listening to determine their first words. The hypothesis was that the first word would be uttered in the root language of all people. When one of the children cried  beks with outstretched arms the shepherd reported this to Psammetichus who concluded that the word was Phrygian because that was the sound of the Phrygian word for bread. Thus they concluded that the Phrygians were an older people than the Egyptians and that Phrygian was the original language of men. There are no other extant sources to verify this story.17 Wivesedit See also Twentysixth Dynasty of Egypt family tree Psamtiks chief wife was Mehytenweskhet the daughter of Harsiese the vizier of the North and High Priest of Re at Heliopolis. Psamtik and Mehytenweskhet were the parents of Necho II Merneith and the Divine Adoratrice Nitocris I.18 Psamtiks fatherinlawthe aforementioned Harsiesewas married twice to Sheta with whom he had a daughter named Naneferheres and to an unknown woman by whom he had both Djedkare who succeeded him as vizier of the North and Mehytenweskhet.19 Discovery of a colossal statue of Psamtik Iedit The colossal statue of Psamtik I discovered at Heliopolis in 2017 Torso of the statue of Psamtik I in the museum garden 20
17.2 0 Reconstruction with indication of size.21 On 9 March 2017 Egyptian and German archaeologists discovered a colossal statue about 
7.9  metres 26 ft in height at the Heliopolis site in Cairo. Made of quartzite the statue was found in a fragmentary state with the bust the lower part of the head and the crown submerged in groundwater.22 It has been confirmed to be of Psamtik I due to engravings found that mentioned one of the pharaohs names on the base of the statue.2324252627 A spokesperson at the time commented that If it does belong to this king then it is the largest statue of the Late Period that was ever discovered in Egypt.2829 The head and torso are expected to be moved to the Grand Egyptian Museum.22 The statue colossus was sculpted in the ancient classical style of 2000 BC establishing a resurgence to the greatness and prosperity of the classical period of old and reconstructions bear a strong similarity with a statue of a striding Senusret I 19711926 BC now in the Cairo Museum.3031 However from the many gathered fragments now 6400 of them of quartzite collected it has also been established that the colossus was at some time deliberately destroyed. Certain discolored  cracked rock fragments show evidence of having been heated to high temperatures then shattered with cold water a typical way of destroying ancient colossi.32 Galleryedit Psamtik I kneeling Louvre Museum Relief of Psamtik I making an offering to RaHorakhty Tomb of Pabasa Slab of Psamtik I.
