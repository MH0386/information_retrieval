2 nd Dynasty Nynetjer also known as Ninetjer and Banetjer is the Horus name of the third pharaoh of the Second Dynasty of Egypt during the Early Dynastic Period. Archaeologically Nynetjer is the best attested king of the entire dynasty. Direct evidence shows that he succeeded Raneb on the throne. What happened after him is much less clear as historical sources and archaeological evidences point to some breakdown or partition of the state. Nynetjers reign is difficult to date precisely with most experts proposing that he flourished some time during the late 
29 th century BC to the early 
27 th century BC. Estimating the duration of his rule is equally difficult and Egyptologists have proposed from 43 to 50 years of reign for him. Attestationsedit Cartouche of Nynetjer in the Abydos King List no. 11. Archaeologically Nynetjer is the best attested kings of the early second dynasty.17 His name appears in inscriptions on stone vessels and clay sealings in large numbers from his tomb at Sakkara. A large number of artifacts bearing his name were also found in the tomb of king Peribsen at Abydos and in the galleries beneath the step pyramid of king Djoser. However the datings of some inscriptions especially those made of black ink caused some problems. Writing experts and archaeologists such as Ilona Regulski point out that the ink inscriptions are of a somewhat later date than the stone and seal inscriptions. She dates the ink markings to the reigns of kings such as Khasekhemwy and Djoser and assumes that the artifacts originated from Abydos. In fact alabaster vessels and earthen jars with black ink inscriptions with very similar font design showing Nynetjers name were found in Peribsens tomb.1819 Nynetjers name also appears on a rock inscription near Abu Handal in Lower Nubia. The inscription only presents a N sign inside a serekh of the king but with the sign Netjer for God placed above the serekh in the position normally occupied by the Horus falcon. Consequently Nynetjers name is rendered as The God N. The absence of Horus may hint at religious disturbances as suggested by the later choices of king Peribsen to have Set instead of Horus above his serekhs and of pharaoh Khasekhemwy final ruler of the dynasty to have both gods facing each other above his.20 The inscription itself might represent a clue that Nynetjer sent a military expedition into this region likely after his 20 years of reign since such an expedition is not mention in the surviving royal annals covering Nynetjers first two decades of rule.20 Identityedit Nynetjer is commonly identified with the Ramesside cartouche names Banetjer from the Abydos King List Banetjeru from the Sakkara table and Netjerren from the Royal Canon of Turin. The Palermo Stone inscription presents an unusual goldname of Nynetjer Rennebu meaning golden offspring or golden calf. This name appears already on artefacts surviving from Nynetjers lifetime and Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck and Toby Wilkinson think that it could be some kind of forerunner of the goldenHorusname that was established in the royal titulature at the beginning of 
3 rd dynasty under king Djoser.21 Chronologyedit Shoulder of Hetepediefs statue with the serekhs of Hotepsekhemwy Raneb and Nynetjer right to left Relative chronologyedit The relative chronological position of Nynetjer as the third ruler of the early Second Dynasty and successor of Raneb makes consensus among Egyptologists.22232425262728 This is directly attested by the contemporary statue of Hetepedief. The statue uncovered in Memphis and made of speckled red granite is one of the earliest example of private Egyptian sculpture. Hetepedief was priest of the mortuary cults of the first three kings of the dynasty whose serekhs are inscribed in seemingly chronological order on Hetepediefs right shoulder Hotepsekhemwy Raneb then Nynetjer.293028 Further archaeological evidences support this theory notably stone bowls of Hotepsekhemwy and Raneb reinscribed during Nynetjers rule.3132 Two historical sources also point to the same conclusion the Old Kingdom royal annals which while not preserving the identity of Nynetjers predecessor is consistent with him not being the first king of the Second Dynasty and the Turin canon a list of kings written under Ramses II c.1303 BC  1213 BC which explicitly ranks Nynetjer as the third king of his dynasty after Hotepsekhemwy and Raneb.33 Reign Durationedit Seated statue of Nynetjer wearing the sedfestival robe The duration of Nynetjers rule may be appraised from several historical sources. The oldest of these is the Old Kingdom royal annals now known after the name of its main fragment the Palermo Stone. These annals were likely first compiled during the early Fifth Dynasty possibly under Neferirkare Kakai mid
25 th century BC around whose reign the record stops.3435 These annals are considered to be a reliable witness to Nynetjers rule notably because they correctly give his name in contrast to the corrupt garbled variants found in later king lists Wilkinson.36 The surviving fragments of the annals record the main events and Nile flood levels from what is likely the seventh year of Nynetjers reign until the 
21 st. The remainder of the records concerning his rule are lost. Nonetheless given the space afforded for each year on the annals and the position of subsequent reigns reconstructions have been attempted from the surviving fragments to estimate the total of Nynetjers years on the throne. With a single exceptionnote 3 all the Egyptologists who studied this problem have proposed long reignsnote 4 lasting between 38 years13 up to 49 years.37 The most recent reconstruction of the royal annals by Wilkinson in 2000 concludes that Nynetjers reign as recorded on the Palermo stone was most probably of 40 complete or partial years.39 The Turin Canon suggests an improbable reign of 96 years40 and Egyptian historian Manetho suggested that Nynetjers reign lasted 47 years.41 Egyptologists question both statements as misinterpretations or exaggerations. They generally credit Nynetjer with a reign of either 43 years or 45 years. Archaeological evidence in favor of a long reign includes the seated statuette of Nynetjer showing him wearing the ceremonial tightfitting vestment of the sed festival a feast for the rejuvenation of the king that came to be celebrated for the first time only after the king had reigned for 30 years.10 Reignedit Eventsedit Year events 721 from the reign of Nynetjer Palermo Stone recto.

21 st year Following of Horus...rest is missing. The Cairo Stone gives the years 3644. The surface of the stone slab is damaged. Therefore most of the events are illegible except for the birth creation of an Anubis fetish and parts of a Appearance of the king of Lower and Upper Egypt.42 The ancient Egyptian historian Manetho over 2000 years later called Nynetjer Binthrs and said that during this rulers reign women received the right to gain royal dignity meaning that women were allowed to reign like a king. Egyptologists such as Walter Bryan Emery assume that this reference was an obituary to the queens Meritneith and Neithhotep from the early 
1 st dynasty both of whom are believed to have held the Egyptian throne for several years because their sons were too young to rule.44 Religionedit The reigns of Raneb and Nynetjer saw the development of sun worship and the cult of Ra.4546 The 
14 th year record on the Palermo stone might refer to the foundation rather than the destruction on Nynetjers behalf of the ShemRa an institution or building whose name has been variously translated as The going of Ra47 The sun proceeds47 or The sun has come.42 Administrationedit The biennial event Following of Horus referred to on the Palermo stone most probably involved a journey of the king and the royal court throughout Egypt.48 From at least the reign of Nynetjer onwards the purpose of this journey was to undertake a census for taxation purposes collect and distribute various commodities. An historical source dated to the Third Dynasty details that this census involved an enumeration of gold and land.48 The responsibility for the supervision of state revenues was under the authority of the chancellor of the treasury of the king49 who directed three administrative institutions introduced by Nynetjer in replacement of an older one.50 Nynetjer might also have introduced an office for food management related to the census.51 At the beginning of Third Dynasty the Following of Horus disappears from the records replaced by a more thorough census which may have originated during Nynetjers reign.52 From at least the reign of Sneferu onwards this extended census included cattle countsunder which name it became knownwhile oxen and small livestock were recorded from the Fifth Dynasty onwards.49 These innovations represent a qualitatively new stage in resource collection and management on behalf of the nascent Egyptian state after the creation in the mid First Dynasty of the institutions responsible for the preparation of the royal tomb and the upkeep of subsequent funerary cults as well as the state treasury.note 554 Nynetjers novelties were certainly paralleled with an increase in the size of the civil service. Its main task was to ensure the continuing existence and effectiveness of kingship which included providing for the kings life after death.54 This in turn required increasing quantities of commodities to be regularly collected as the Second Dynasty royal tombs were modelled after the kings palace incorporating a large number of storage rooms for wine and food.55 End of reign and successionedit Fragment of a vase of Nynetjer discovered in the tomb of SethPeribsen which may have been part of the equipment of a boat of the king depicted below his name.56 What happened towards the end of Nynetjers rule and shortly thereafter is very uncertain. It is possible though not certain57 that Egypt saw civil unrest58 and the rise of competing claimants to the throne reigning concurrently over two realms in Upper and Lower Egypt.5925 Historical records preserve conflicting lists of kings between the end of Nynetjers reign and that of Khasekhemwy.60 Three hypotheses have been put forth to explain these observations first there could have been a political breakdown and a religious conflict second this could result from a deliberate choice on Nynetjers behalf following administrative considerations or third an economic collapse might have led to Egyptian disunity. For Erik Hornung the troubles originate from an Upper Egyptian reaction to the migration of power and royal interest towards Memphis and Lower Egypt leading to a breakdown of the unity of the state.61 This is manifested through he abandonment of the First Dynasty necropolis of Abydos in favor of Saqqara which saw the construction of the tombs of the first three kings of the Second Dynasty. This political conflict might also have taken on a religious aspect under Nynetjers successors Hornung and Schlgl point to Peribsens choice of the god Set rather than Horus as a divine patron for his name Set being an Upper Egyptian god from Ombos.61 Peribsen further chose to have his tomb built in old royal burial grounds of Abydos where he also erected a funerary enclosure.61 A Lower Egyptian response to these developments also took place with kings who associated themselves to Horus reigning concurrently over the North of Egypt.1061 Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck Nicolas Grimal Hermann Alexander Schlgl and Francesco Tiradritti believe instead that Nynetjer left a realm that was suffering from an overly complex state administration. Consequently Nynetjer could have decided to split Egypt between his two successors possibly his sons who would rule two separate kingdoms in the hope that the two rulers could better administer the states.6263 Diorite vase of Nynetjer bearing the kings name and mentioning a palace of the White Crown. Discovered in the gallery B beneath the Pyramid of Djoser. In contrast Egyptologists such as Barbara Bell believe that an economic catastrophe such as a famine or a long lasting drought affected Egypt around this time. Therefore to address the problem of feeding the Egyptian population Nynetjer split the realm into two and his successors ruled two independent states until the famine came to an end. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone where in her opinion the records of the annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period.64 Bells theory is now refuted by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer who corrected Bells calculations. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at their usual levels at Nynetjers time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell had overlooked that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo Stone inscriptions only takes into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis but not elsewhere along the river. Any longlasting drought is therefore less likely to be an explanation.65 It is also unclear if Nynetjers successor already shared his throne with another ruler or if the Egyptian state was split at the time of his death. All known king lists such as the Sakkara list the Turin Canon and the Abydos table list a king Wadjenes as Nynetjers immediate successor and as the predecessor of a king called Senedj. After Senedj the kinglists differ from each other regarding successors. While the Sakkara list and the Turin canon mention the kings Neferkara I Neferkasokar and Hudjefa I as immediate successors the Abydos list skips them and lists a king Djadjay identical with king Khasekhemwy. If Egypt was already divided when Senedj gained the throne kings like Sekhemib and Peribsen would have ruled Upper Egypt whilst Senedj and his successors Neferkara and Hudjefa I would have ruled Lower Egypt. The division of Egypt was brought to an end by Khasekhemwy.66 Tombedit Fragment of a diorite vase mentioning Nynetjer and the goddess of the Delta Bastet. The tomb of Nynetjer was discovered by Selim Hassan in 1938 while he was excavating mastabas under the aegis of the Service des Antiquits de lEgypte in the vicinity of the Pyramid of Unas.67 Hassan proposed that Nynetjer was the owner of the tomb thanks to numerous seal impressions bearing his serekh found onsite.note 669 The tomb was partially excavated in the 19
70 s to 19
80 s under the direction of Peter Munro70 then Gnther Dreyer71 who both confirmed Hassans proposition.72 Thorough excavations continued during seven campaigns until the 20
10 s under the supervision of archaeologist Claudia LacherRaschdorff of the Deutsches Archologisches Institut.9 Locationedit Nynetjers tomb lies in North Saqqara. Now known as Gallery Tomb B the ancient name of the tomb might originally have been Nurse of Horus or Nurse of the God.73 The tomb is located out of sight of Memphis7475 next to a natural wadi running west to east75 which may have functioned as a causeway from the valley up to the local plateau. This location was not only convenientthe wadi serving as an accessway for bringing construction materials to the tombbut also ensured that the tomb remained hidden from the Nile valley76 and set within a desert backdrop symbolizing death which the king would finally overcome.77 Nynetjers tomb in the immediate vicinity of Hotepsekhemwys and Ranebs78 now lies beneath the causeway of Unas built at the end of the Fifth Dynasty. By that time the original entrance of the tomb had already been blocked by a ditch which Djoser had dug around his own pyramid.79 All aboveground structures which may have been associated to Nynetjers tomb have been largely destroyed7880 either during Unas rule81 or earlier under Djosers.82 To the south and east of the tomb archaeological evidences suggest the presence of a wider necropolis of the Second Dynasty hosting the gallery tombs of several high ranking officials of the time.83 According to Erik Hornung the choice of Saqqara over the Abydos burial grounds of the First Dynasty points to some neglect of the older Upper Egyptian center of power in favour of Memphis which might have contributed to an Upper Egyptian reaction in the troubled times following Nynetjers rule.10 Superstructureedit Archaeological excavations suggest the existence of aboveground structures originally associated with Nynetjers tomb none of which have survived.75 Archaeological remains are not sufficient to determine the layout of the structures nor if they were made of mudbrick or limestone.75 They most likely incorporated an offering place with false door and niche stele a mortuary temple and a serdab.84 The heights of these superstructures may have reached 8 m 26 ft to 10 m 33 ft and may have resembled a mastaba.85 A separate enclosure wall built of stone was in all probability built as well86 such structures accompanying royal tombs since the First Dynasty albeit here likely on a much grander scale. The nearby Gisr elMudir and Lshape enclosures may belong to Hotepsekhemwy and Nynetjer.8776 Substructuresedit The tomb comprises two vast subterranean ensembles hewn into the local rock. The main one dug some 5 m 16 ft to 6 m 20 ft below ground level88 has 157 rooms of 
2.1  m 
6.9  ft height over an area of 77 m  
50.5  m 253 ft  166 ft.75 The second ensemble is made of 34 rooms. The tomb was originally entered via a 25 m 82 ftlong ramp blocked by two portcullises and leading to three galleries on a rough eastwest axis. These extend into a mazelike system of doorways vestibules and corridors built during two distinct construction phases.75 LacherRaschdorff estimates that the tomb rooms and galleries could have been dug by a team of 90 people working over a duration of two years. Copper tools marks show that the workers were organised in several groups hewing the rock from different directions.89 The tomb marks an important development in monumental royal mortuary architecture with its extended layout incorporating many storage rooms while the tomb itself became the locus of renewal funerary rituals.84 At the southern end of the tomb a group of chambers seems to be model of the royal palace.9091 Some chambers of the tomb were found almost undisturbed92 still holding some of Nynetjers original burial goods. One such room included 560 jars of wine some of which were still sealed by sealings bearing the kings name and covered by a thick net made of plant fibres. Another room produced the fragments of a further 420 unfinished and unsealed wine jars which seem to have been deliberately broken in a ceremony at the time of burial.7593 Further vessels include a group decorated with red stripes that held jujube fruits and less than ten jars of beer.75 Excavations of the tomb also yielded 144 to 151 stone tools comprising knives with and without handles stone sickles blades scrapers hatchets and many further fragments of stone tools. There were also numerous stone vessels and unworked pieces of stones left for producing further vessels in the afterlife.7593 Detailed examination of the stone tools revealed minor traces of use and residues of a reddishbrown liquid but no identifiable wear from intensive use nor resharpening of the tools seems to have taken place LacherRaschdorff therefore hypotheses that the tools were made for the burial of the king and used during a ceremony for slaughtering animals and preparing food.94 In addition some pieces of carved wood suggest the presence of a tent or canopy in the mortuary equipment of the king similar to that found in the later tomb of queen Hetepheres I fl. c. 2600 BC.75 Nynetjers tomb shows great architectural similarities to the Gallery Tomb A which is thought to be either Ranebs or Hotepsekhemwys burial site. This led the DAI to the conclusion that Nynetjer was inspired by his predecessors tombs. Some of the wine jars originated from the tombs of the late First Dynasty. The main burial chamber was located at the southwestern end of the tomb but the whole burial site is highly unstable and is in danger of collapsing.959697 Later usagesedit The northern part of Nynetjers gallery tomb area was covered by the necropolis associated with the pyramid of Unas at the end of the Fifth Dynasty. A mummy mask and a womans coffin of the Ramesside era found in the tomb indicate that it was partially reused during the New Kingdom. At this time an extensive private necropolis extended over the entire area of the tomb. This necropolis continued to be used until the Late Period and more sporadically until the early Christian period when the nearby monastery of Jeremiah was built.75 Notesedit  According to publications1 as well as the purchase description of the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden the statue of Pharaoh Ninetjer was made of alabaster but doubts soon arose about this after purchase. In 2017 the statue was therefore examined by geologist Dr. Hanco Zwaan of the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden. It turned out that the statue was indeed made of a different rock namely quartzite. The hard quartzite is difficult to work especially with the bronze and flint tools available to the Egyptians at the time. It is therefore special that they could already handle this hard rock so well.2  Proposed dates for Nynetjers reign c. 2810 BC5 28102760 BC6 27902754 BC7 27852742 BC89 27672717 BC6 27602715 BC10 c. 27002660 BC.11  With the exception of Ricci who proposed only 15 years of reign for Nynetjer in his 1917 appraisal of the Palermo stone.37  Following Helck who points to Nynetjers celebrating a sedfestival to support a reign of at least 30 years38 Wilkinson sees 35 years as the minimum possible duration for Nynetjers reign given the space devoted to it on the royal annals.17  In the early dynastic period this treasury did not function as envisaged by a modern reader53 rather it was an institution responsible for administering agricultural produces andor stone ware the latter being an important component of the funerary furniture. Tombs of kings of the First to Third Dynasties included thousands to tens of thousands of stone bowls jars and cups. The ritualised supply of these to the royal tomb played a major role in the grand spectacle of the preparation of the kings tomb and so were a crucial element in the early ideology of kingship.53  The large mastaba of the high official Ruaben or NiRuab who held his office during the reign of Nynetjer now known as mastaba S2302 had been proposed to be Nynetjers tomb until Hassans proposal regarding gallery tomb B as the burial site of the king was confirmed. The earlier misinterpretations were caused by the large amount of clay seals with Nynetjers serekh name that were found in Ruabens mastaba.68 Referencesedit  Wilkinson 2005 p. 72.
