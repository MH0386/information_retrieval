30 th Dynasty Nectanebo I Egyptian Ntnb.f Greek  Nectanebis died 36160 BCE was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh founder of the last native dynasty of Egypt the 
30 th. Nameedit Nectanebos Egyptian personal name was Ntnb.f which means the strong one of his lord. Greek sources rendered the name as  Nectanebis. The writings of Manetho which have been preserved by George Syncellus spell it  Nectanebs but this is probably only based on a phonetic approximation due to iotacism.4 Although convention in English assigns identical names to him and his grandson Nectanebo II the two in fact had different names.5 Reignedit Accession and familyedit Nectanebo was an army general from Sebennytos son of an important military officer named Djedhor and of a lady whose name is only partially recorded ...mu.6 A stele found at Hermopolis7 provides some evidence that he came to power by overthrowing and possibly putting to death the last pharaoh of the 
29 th Dynasty Nepherites II.8 It has been suggested that Nectanebo was assisted in the coup by the Athenian general Chabrias. Nectanebo carried out the coronation ceremony in c. 3798 BCE in both Sais and Memphis9 and shifted the capital from Mendes to Sebennytos.10 The relationships between Nectanebo and the pharaohs of the previous dynasty are not entirely clear. He showed little regard for both Nepherites II and his father Achoris calling the former inept and the latter a usurper.1112 He seemed to have had a higher regard for Nepherites I who was formerly believed to be Nectanebos father or grandfather although it is now believed that this view was due to a misinterpretation of the Demotic Chronicle.8 However it has been suggested that both Achoris and Nectanebo may have been Nepherites Is relatives in some way.12 Nectanebo had two known sons Teos who was his appointed successor and Tjahapimu.8 Activities in Egyptedit Vestibule of the Temple of Isis at Philae Nectanebo was a great builder and restorer to an extent not seen in Egypt for centuries.11 He ordered work on many of the temples across the country.13 On the sacred island of Philae near Aswan he began the temple of Isis which would become one of the most important religious sites in ancient Egypt by erecting its vestibule.1314 Nectanebo also began the First Pylon in the Precinct of AmunRe at Karnak and it is believed that the earliest known mammisi which was found at Dendera was built by him.1415 The cult of sacred animals which became prominent between the two Persian occupation periods the 
27 th and 
31 st dynasties respectively was supported by Nectanebo as evidenced by archaeological findings at Hermopolis Hermopolis Parva Saft elHinna and Mendes. Further works ordered by the pharaoh have been found in religious buildings at Memphis Tanis and El Kab.1516 First Pylon Karnak Nectanebo was also generous towards the priesthood. A decree dated to his first year and discovered on a stele at Naucratis required that 10 percent of taxes collected both from imports and from local production in this city were to be used for the temple of Neith at Sais.17 A twin of this stele was recently discovered in the nowsubmerged city of Heracleion.18 The aforementioned stele from Hermopolis placed before a pylon of Ramesses II lists the donations made by Nectanebo to the local deities and other benefits were also granted to the priesthood of Horus at Edfu.17 Nectanebos prodigality showed his devotion to the gods and at the same time financially supported the largest holders of wealth of the country and for expenditure on the defence of the country.11 Defeating Persian invasionedit In 3743 BCE Nectanebo had to face a Persian attempt to retake Egypt which was still considered by the Achaemenid king Artaxerxes II nothing more than a rebel satrapy. After a sixyear preparation and applying pressure on Athens to recall the Greek general Chabrias19 Artaxerxes dispatched a great army led by the Athenian general Iphicrates and the Persian Pharnabazus. It has been recorded that the army was composed of over 200000 troops including Persian soldiers and Greek mercenaries and around 500 ships. Nectanebo ordered fortifications built along the Pelusiac branch of the Nile compelling the enemy fleet to find its way up the lessdefended Mendesian branch.19 1914 book illustration with a meeting between Nectanebo I and the Spartan king Agesilaus center attended by the Athenian general Chabrias left. At this point the mutual distrust that had arisen between Iphicrates and Pharnabazus prevented the enemy from reaching Memphis. Then the annual Nile flood and the Egyptian defenders resolve to defend their territory turned what had initially appeared as certain defeat for Nectanebo I and his troops into a complete victory.20 From 368 BCE many western satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire started to rebel against Artaxerxes II so Nectanebo provided financial support to the rebelling satraps and reestablished ties with both Sparta and Athens.15 Successionedit Nectanebo died during his 
19 th year as ruler. His tomb sarcophagus and mummy have never been found. Towards the end of his reign in Year 16  3643 BCE probably to remedy the dynastic problems that plagued his predecessors Nectanebo restored the longlost practice of the coregency associating his son Teos to the throne. However shortly after Teos accession his brother Tjahapimu betrayed him and managed to put his own son Nakhthorheb Nectanebo II onto the Egyptian throne.8 Referencesedit  Lloyd 1994 p. 358  Depuydt 2006 p. 279  von Beckerath 1999 pp. 226227.
