No monuments are attested to this king but along with his successor Ankhwennefer also known as Chaonnophris or Ankhmakis1 he held a large part of Egypt until 186 BC. A graffito dating to about 201 BC on a wall of the mortuary Temple of Seti I at Abydos in which his name is written  Hyrgonaphor is an attestation to the extent of his influence and the ideology of his reign.2 He appears to have died before 197 BC. The Abydene graffito one of the few documents remaining from his reign is written in Egyptian using Greek letters the oldest testimony of a development which would end in the Coptic script replacing the native Egyptian demotic.3 Referencesedit  Gnther Hlbl History of the Ptolemaic Empire Routledge 2000 pp. 1
