However the specific title was not used to address the kings of Egypt by their contemporaries until the New Kingdoms 
18 th Dynasty c. 1400 BC. Along with the title Pharaoh for later rulers there was an Ancient Egyptian royal titulary used by Egyptian kings which remained relatively constant during the course of Ancient Egyptian history initially featuring a Horus name a Sedge and Bee nswtbjtj name and a Two Ladies nbtj name with the additional Golden Horus nomen and prenomen titles being added successively during later dynasties. Egypt was continually governed at least in part by native pharaohs for approximately 2500 years until it was conquered by the Kingdom of Kush in the late 
8 th century BC whose rulers adopted the traditional pharaonic titulature for themselves. Following the Kushite conquest Egypt experienced another period of independent native rule before being conquered by the Achaemenid Empire whose rulers also adopted the title of Pharaoh. The last native pharaoh of Egypt was Nectanebo II who was pharaoh before the Achaemenids conquered Egypt for a second time. Achaemenid rule over Egypt came to an end through the conquests of Alexander the Great in 332 BC after which it was ruled by Hellenic Pharaohs of the Ptolemaic Dynasty. Their rule and the independence of Egypt came to an end when Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BC. Augustus and subsequent Roman emperors were styled as Pharaoh when in Egypt until the reign of Maximinus Daza in 314 AD. The dates given in this list of pharaohs are approximate. They are based primarily on the conventional chronology of Ancient Egypt mostly based on the Digital Egypt for Universities3 database developed by the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology but alternative dates taken from other authorities may be indicated separately. Ancient Egyptian king listsedit Modern lists of pharaohs are based on historical records and including Ancient Egyptian king lists and later histories such as Manethos Aegyptiaca as well as archaeological evidence. Concerning ancient sources Egyptologists and historians alike call for caution in regard to the credibility exactitude and completeness of these sources many of which were written long after the reigns they report.4 An additional problem is that ancient king lists are often damaged inconsistent with one another andor selective. The following ancient king lists are known along with the dynasty under which they were created5 Den seal impressions

Around 3125 BC Djer36 Itetj Greek form Knkenes. His tomb was later thought to be the legendary tomb of Osiris. First pharaoh with a full Golden Horus name. Interest and trade with Egypts North Eastern borders appears to have been renewed during Djers reign.35 54 years37 Djet38 Ita Greek form Ouenephes. Indications show that Djet did not reign for long.39 10 years40 Merneith  Possibly the first female Pharaoh of Egypt. She may have ruled as regent for her son Den. Her tomb is notable for being on the same scale as other tombs of other kings of that period. Around 2950 BC Den41 Khasti Greek form Ousaphaidos. Den was the first pharaoh to have a Nesutbitidual king name and is the first pharaoh attested wearing the double crown pschent of upper and lower Egypt.42 A second sed festival is attested from his reign indicating he enjoyed a long time in power.42 Den focused on the northeastern part of Egypt during his reign and also led a few small battles in the northeast which are attested on the Palermo stone.43 42 years40 Adjib Merybiap Greek form Miebids.44 Known for his ominous nebwytitle.45 10 years Semerkhet Iry Greek form Semempss.46 First Egyptian ruler with a fully developed Nebty name. His complete reign is preserved on the Cairo Stone. Many stone vessels of his predecessor were found reinscribed for Semerkhet so he may have been a usurper.47 812 years40 Qaa Sen Greek form Bienkhes.48 Ruled very long his tomb is the last one with subsidiary tombs. 34 years Sneferka  Very short reign correct chronological position unknown. Around 2900 BC Horus Bird  Very short reign correct chronological position unknown. Around 2900 BC Second Dynastyedit Main article Second Dynasty of Egypt The Second Dynasty ruled from 2890 to 2686 BC.31 Image Throne name Personal name Comments Dates Hotepsekhemwy49 Sehotep Manetho names him Bothos and reports that under this ruler an earthquake killed many people. Hotepsekhemwy broke the tradition of being buried at the Abydos royal cemetery at UmmelQaab where most of the 
1 st dynasty kings are buried and chose to be buried at Saqqara instead to be closer to the capital.50 15 years Nebra51  Greek form Kaechs after the Ramesside cartouche name Kakaw. First ruler who uses the sunsymbol in his royal name could be identical to king Weneg. 14 years Nynetjer52 Banetjer Greek form Binthris. May have divided Egypt between his successors allegedly allowed women to rule like pharaohs. 4345 years Ba  May have been an independent ruler succeeding Nynetjer.

1 st or 
3 rd dynasties or be the same person as Horus Bird. Unknown WenegNebty53  Greek form Ougotlas  Tls. Could be an independent ruler succeeding Nynetjer or the same as Peribsen SekhemibPerenmaat or Raneb. Around 2740 BC Wadjenes  Greek form Tlas May have been a misinterpretation of the hieroglyphic sign of a flower called Weneg. May have been a crown prince or be the same person as WenegNebty. Around 2740 BC Nubnefer  May have been the birth name of Nebra. May either be the successor of Wadjenes or Nynetjer. Unknown Senedj54  Greek form Sethenes. Possibly the same person as Peribsen. This however is highly disputed.55 47 years supposedly SethPeribsen Peribsen Used a Sethanimal above his serekh rather than a Horus falcon. He promoted the suncult in Egypt and reduced the powers of officials nomarchs and palatines. Some scholars believe that he ruled over a divided Egypt.56 Unknown Sekhemib SekhemibPerenmaat Could be the same person as SethPeribsen.57 Around 2720 BC Neferkara I Greek form Npherchers. Known only from Ramesside king lists not archaeologically attested. 25 years according to Manetho Neferkasokar Greek form Seschris. Known only from Ramesside king lists not archaeologically attested. Old Kingdom legends claim that this ruler saved Egypt from a longlasting drought.58 8 years Horus Sa  May have been a short form of the Horusname Sanakht. May have been the Horusname of Weneg or Senedj correct chronological position unclear. Unknown  Hudjefa Known only from Ramesside king lists his name is actually a paraphrase pointing out that the original name of the king was already lost in Ramesside times. 11 years according to the Turin Canon KhasekhemKhasekhemwy50 Bebety Greek form Cheners. It is probable that when Khasekhem acceded kingship he was a ruler of upper Egypt he led campaigns against lower Egypt that ended in his victory to commemorate his achievement of reunifying Egypt he changed his name to Khasekhemwy.50 His serekh name is unique for presenting both Horus and Set. He was one of Egypts first master builders his funerary enclosure known as ShunetezZebib is a colossal mudbrick structure.59 18 years Old Kingdomedit Main article Old Kingdom of Egypt The Old Kingdom of Egypt is the long period of stability and growth following the Early Dynastic Period and preceding the troubled First Intermediate Period.

2 year old infant were found.64 26492643 BC Nebka Sanakht Likely to be identified with the throne name Nebka Hellenized names Necherchis and Necherphes. May have reigned 6 years if identified with the penultimate king of the Dynasty on the Turin canon. Around 2650 BC Qahedjet  Possibly be the same person as Huni or an archaistic representation of Thutmose III correct chronological position unknown. Unknown Khaba  Possibly built an unfinished step pyramid could be identical with Huni. 26432637 BC Huni65 Greek form ches. Could be the same as Qahedjet or Khaba. Possibly built an unfinished step pyramid and several cultic pyramids throughout Egypt. Huni was for a long time credited with the building of the pyramid of Meidum. This however is disproved by New Kingdom graffiti that praise king Sneferu not Huni. 26372613 BC Fourth Dynastyedit Main article Fourth Dynasty of Egypt The Fourth Dynasty ruled from 2613 to 2496 BC.31 Image Throne name Personal name Comments Dates Sneferu Nebmaat Greek form Sris. Reigned 48 years giving him enough time to build the Meidum Pyramid the Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid. Some scholars believe that he was buried in the Red Pyramid. For a long time it was thought that the Meidum Pyramid was not Sneferus work but that of king Huni. Ancient Egyptian documents describe Sneferu as a pious generous and even accostable ruler.66 26132589 BC31 Khnum Khufu Medjedu Greek form Cheops and Suphis. Built the Great Pyramid of Giza. Khufu is depicted as a cruel tyrant by ancient Greek authors Ancient Egyptian sources however describe him as a generous and pious ruler. He is the main protagonist in the Westcar Papyrus. The first imprinted papyri originate from Khufus reign which may have made ancient Greek authors believe that Khufu wrote books in attempt to praise the gods. 25892566 BC Djedefre Kheper Greek form Rtoises. Some scholars believe he created the Great Sphinx of Giza as a monument for his deceased father. He also created a pyramid at Abu Rawash. However this pyramid is no longer extant it is believed the Romans repurposed the materials from which it was made. 25662558 BC Khafre Userib Greek form Chphren and Suphis II. His pyramid is the second largest in Giza. Some scholars prefer him as the creator of the Great Sphinx before Djedefra. His funerary complex was the largest at the Giza plateau. 25582532 BC  Baka Greek form Bikheris. Could be the owner of the Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet elAryan. Possibly fictional. Around 2570 BC Menkaure Kakhet Greek form Menchres. His pyramid is the third and smallest in Giza. A legend claims that his only daughter died due to an illness and Menkaura buried her in a golden coffin in the shape of a cow. 25322503 BC Shepseskaf Shepeskhet Greek form Seberchres. Owner of the Mastabat elFaraun. 25032498 BC  Thamphthis According to Manetho the last king of the

00 m long causeway from the bank of the river Nile to his funerary complex this is where his funerary precession would have taken place. 23752345 BC Sixth Dynastyedit Main article Sixth Dynasty of Egypt The Sixth Dynasty ruled from 2345 to 2181 BC.

7 th
8 th Dynasties. Short reign c. 21822179 BC First Intermediate Periodedit Main article First Intermediate Period of Egypt The First Intermediate Period 21832060 BC is a period of disarray and chaos between the end of the Old Kingdom and the advent of the Middle Kingdom. The Old Kingdom rapidly collapsed after the death of Pepi II. He had reigned for more than 64 and likely up to 94 years longer than any monarch in history. The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age. The union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine. The kings of the 
7 th and 
8 th Dynasties who represented the successors of the 
6 th Dynasty tried to hold onto some power in Memphis but owed much of it to powerful nomarchs. After 20 to 45 years they were overthrown by a new line of pharaohs based in Herakleopolis Magna. Some time after these events a rival line based at Thebes revolted against their nominal Northern overlords and united Upper Egypt. Around 2055 BC Mentuhotep II the son and successor of pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands thereby starting the Middle Kingdom. Seventh and Eighth Dynastiesedit Main articles Seventh Dynasty of Egypt and Eighth Dynasty of Egypt The Seventh and Eighth Dynasties ruled for approximately 2045 years. They comprise numerous ephemeral kings reigning from Memphis over a possibly divided Egypt and in any case holding only limited power owing to the effectively feudal system into which the administration had evolved. The list below is based on the Abydos King List dating to the reign of Seti I and taken from Jrgen von Beckeraths Handbuch der gyptischen Knigsnamen70 as well as from Kim Ryholts latest reconstruction of the Turin canon another king list dating to the Ramesside Era.71 Image Throne name Personal name Comments Dates Menkare  Likely attested by a relief fragment from the tomb of queen Neit.727374 Probably short around 2181 BC Neferkare II   Unknown Neferkare III Neby Attested by inscriptions in the tomb of his mother Ankhesenpepi started the construction of a pyramid in Saqqara.

13 th Dynasty. Second Intermediate Periodedit Main article Second Intermediate Period of Egypt The Second Intermediate Period 18021550 BC is a period of disarray between the end of the Middle Kingdom and the start of the New Kingdom. It is best known as when the Hyksos whose reign comprised the Fifteenth Dynasty made their appearance in Egypt. The Thirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the Twelfth Dynasty and was unable to hold onto the two lands of Egypt. Either at the start of the dynasty c. 1805 BC or toward the middle of it in c. 1710 BC the provincial ruling family in Xois located in the marshes of the eastern Delta broke away from the central authority to form the Canaanite Fourteenth Dynasty. The Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of Sobekhotep IV and around 1720 BC took control of the town of Avaris the modern Tell elDabaKhatana conquering the kingdom of the 
14 th dynasty. Sometime around 1650 BC the Hyksos perhaps led by Salitis the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty conquered Memphis thereby terminating the 
13 th dynasty. The power vacuum in Upper Egypt resulting from the collapse of the 
13 th dynasty allowed the 
16 th dynasty to declare its independence in Thebes only to be overrun by the Hyksos kings shortly thereafter. Subsequently as the Hyksos withdrew from Upper Egypt the native Egyptian ruling house in Thebes set itself up as the Seventeenth Dynasty. This dynasty eventually drove the Hyksos back into Asia under Seqenenre Tao Kamose and finally Ahmose first pharaoh of the New Kingdom. Thirteenth Dynastyedit Main article Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt The Thirteenth Dynasty following the Turin King List ruled from 1802 to around 1649 BC and lasted 153 or 154 years according to Manetho.
