He ruled from 1897 BC to 1878 BC. His pyramid was constructed at ElLahun. Senusret II took a great deal of interest in the Faiyum oasis region and began work on an extensive irrigation system from Bahr Yussef through to Lake Moeris through the construction of a dike at ElLahun and the addition of a network of drainage canals. The purpose of his project was to increase the amount of cultivable land in that area.11 The importance of this project is emphasized by Senusret IIs decision to move the royal necropolis from Dahshur to ElLahun where he built his pyramid. This location would remain the political capital for the 
12 th and 
13 th Dynasties of Egypt. Senusret II was known by his prenomen Khakheperre which means The Ka of Re comes into being. The king also established the first known workers quarter in the nearby town of Senusrethotep Kahun.12 Unlike his successor Senusret II maintained good relations with the various nomarchs or provincial governors of Egypt who were almost as wealthy as the pharaoh.13 His Year 6 is attested in a wall painting from the tomb of a local nomarch named Khnumhotep II at Beni Hasan. Reignedit Coregencyedit Coregencies are a major issue for Egyptologists understanding of the history of the Middle Kingdom and the Twelfth Dynasty.1415 The Egyptologist Claude Obsomer wholly rejects the possibility of coregencies in the Twelfth Dynasty.16 The Egyptologist Karl JansenWinkeln17 having investigated Obsomers work concluded in favour of coregencies.18 JansenWinkeln cites a rock stele found at Konosso as irrefutable evidence in favour of a coregency between Senusret II and Amenemhat II and by extension proof of coregencies in the Twelfth Dynasty.19 The Egyptologist William J. Murnane states that the coregencies of the period are all known ... from doubledatednote 2 documents.21 The Egyptologist Thomas Schneider concludes that recently discovered documents and archaeological evidence are effectively proof of coregencies in this period.22 Some sources ascribe a coregency period to Senusret IIs rule with his father Amenemhat II as his coregent. The Egyptologist Peter Clayton ascribes at least three years of coregency to Senusret IIs reign.23 The Egyptologist Nicolas Grimal assigns nearly five years of coregency prior to sole accession to the throne.1 Length of reignedit A figure wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt and whose face appears to reflect the features of the reigning king most probably Amenemhat II or Senusret II. It functioned as a divine guardian for the imiut and it is wearing a divine kilt which suggests that the statuette was not merely a representation of the living ruler.24 The lengths of the reigns of Senusret II and Senusret III are one of the main considerations for discerning the chronology of the Twelfth Dynasty.15 The Turin Canon is believed to assign a reign of 19 years to Senusret II and 30 years of reign to Senusret III.25 This traditional view was challenged in 1972 when the Egyptologist William Kelly Simpson observed that the latest attested regnal year for Senusret II was his 
7 th and similarly for Senusret III his 
19 th.25 Kim Ryholt a professor of Egyptology at the University of Copenhagen suggests the possibility that the names on the canon had been misarranged and offers two possible regnal lengths for Senusret II 10 years or 19 years.26 Several Egyptologists such as Thomas Schneider cite Mark C. Stones article published in the Gttinger Miszellen in 1997 as determining that Senusret IIs highest recorded regnal year was his 
8 th based on Stela Cairo JE 594
85.2 7 Some scholars prefer to ascribe him a reign of only 10 years and assign the 
19 year reign to Senusret III instead. Other Egyptologists however such as Jrgen von Beckerath and Frank Yurco have maintained the traditional view of a longer 
19 year reign for Senusret II given the level of activity undertaken by the king during his reign.citation needed Yurco notes that reducing Senusret IIs regnal length to 6 years poses difficulties because That pharaoh built a complete pyramid at Kahun with a solid granite funerary temple and complex of buildings. Such projects optimally took fifteen to twenty years to complete even with the mudbrick cores used in Middle Kingdom pyramids.28 At present the problem concerning the reign length of Senusret II is irresolvable but many Egyptologists today prefer to assign him a reign of 9 or 10 years only given the absence of higher dates attested for him beyond his 
8 th regnal year. This would entail amending the 
19 year figure which the Turin Canon assigns for a 
12 th dynasty ruler in his position to 9 years instead. However Senusret IIs monthly figure on the throne might be ascertained. According to Jrgen von Beckerath the temple documents of ElLahun the pyramid city of SesostrisSenusret II often mention the Festival of Going Forth to Heaven which might be the date of death for this ruler.29 These documents state that this Festival occurred on IV Peret day 
14.3 03132 However Rita Gautschy states that this Festival date did not mark the actual day of Senusret IIs death but of his funeral or burial.33 Lisa Saladino Haney observes that based on Gautschys interpretation of this date Therefore if one takes seventy days from the feast day IV Peret 14 one gets II Peret 4 as the approximate date of death of SenwosretSenusret II.34 Domestic activitiesedit Senusret IIs royal uraeus found in his pyramid tomb. The Faiyum Oasis a region in Middle Egypt has been inhabited by humans for more than 8000 years.35 It became an important centre in Egypt during the Middle Kingdom.35 Throughout the period rulers undertook developmental projects turning Faiyum into an agricultural religious and resortlike centre.35 The oasis was located 80 km 50 mi southwest of Memphis offering arable land1 centred around Lake Moeris a natural body of water.35 Senusret II initiated a project to exploit the marshy regions natural resources for hunting and fishing a project continued by his successors and which matured during the reign of his grandson Amenemhat III.1 To set off this project Senusret II developed an irrigation system with a dyke and a network of canals which siphoned water from Lake Moeris.91 The land reclaimed in this project was then farmed.36 Cults honouring the crocodile god Sobek were prominent at the time.35 Activities outside Egyptedit Senusret IIs reign ushered in a period of peace and prosperity with no recorded military campaigns and the proliferation of trade between Egypt and the NearEast.9 Around the same time parties of Western Asiatic foreigners visiting the Pharaoh with gifts are recorded as in the tomb paintings of 
12 thdynasty official Khnumhotep II who also served under Senusret III. These foreigners possibly Canaanites or Bedouins are labelled as Aamu mw including the leading man with a Nubian ibex labelled as Abisha the Hyksos  sw Heqakasut for Hyksos the first known instance of the name Hyksos.37383940 A group of West Asiatic foreigners bringing gift to the Pharaoh.

12 thdynasty official Khnumhotep II who served under Senusret III at Beni Hasan c.1900 BC.37383940 Successionedit Pectoral of Senusret II tomb of Sithathoriunet There is an absence of serious evidence for a coregency between Senusret II and Senusret III.41 Murnane identifies that the only existing evidence for a coregency of Senusret II and III is a scarab with both kings names inscribed on it.42 The association can be explained as being the result of retroactive dating where Senusret IIs final regnal year was absorbed into Senusret IIIs first one as would be supported by contemporaneous evidence from the Turin Canon which give Senusret II a regnal duration of 19 full regnal years and a partial one.43 A dedicatory inscription celebrating the resumption of rituals begun by Senusret II and III and a papyrus with entries identifying Senusret IIs nineteenth regnal year and Senusret IIIs first regnal year are scant evidence and do not necessitate a coregency.42 Murnane argues that if there was a coregency it could not have lasted more than a few months.42 The evidence from the papyrus document is now obviated by the fact that the document has been securely dated to Year 19 of Senusret III and Year 1 of Amenemhet III.citation needed At present no document from Senusret IIs reign has been discovered from Lahun the kings new capital city. Tomb treasureedit Crown of Princess Sithathoriunet. In 1889 the Egyptologist Flinders Petrie found a marvellous gold and inlaid royal uraeus that must have originally formed part of Senusret IIs looted burial equipment in a flooded chamber of the kings pyramid tomb.44 It is now located in the Cairo Museum. The tomb of Princess Sithathoriunet a daughter of Senusret II was also discovered by Egyptologists in a separate burial site. Several pieces of jewellery from her tomb including a pair of pectorals and a crown or diadem were found there. They are now displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of New York or the Cairo Museum in Egypt. In 2009 Egyptian archaeologists announced the results of new excavations led by the Egyptologist Abdul Rahman AlAyedi. They described unearthing a cache of pharaonicera mummies in brightly painted wooden coffins near the Lahun pyramid. The mummies were reportedly the first to be found in the sandcovered desert rock surrounding the pyramid.45 Pyramidedit Main article Pyramid of Senusret II The pyramid of Senusret II at ElLahun The pyramid was built around a framework of limestone radial arms similar to the framework used by Senusret I. Instead of using an infill of stones mud and mortar Senusret II used an infill of mud bricks before cladding the structure with a layer of limestone veneer. The outer cladding stones were locked together using dovetail inserts some of which still remain. A trench was dug around the central core that was filled with stones to act as a French Drain. The limestone cladding stood in this drain indicating that Senusret II was concerned with water damage. There were eight mastabas and one small pyramid to the north of Senusrets complex and all were within the enclosure wall. The wall had been encased in limestone that was decorated with niches perhaps as a copy of Djosers complex at Saqqara. The mastabas were solid and no chambers have found within or beneath indicating that they were cenotaphs and possibly symbolic in nature. Flinders Petrie investigated the auxiliary pyramid and found no chambers. Limestone slab showing the cartouche of Senusret II and the name and image of the goddess Nekhbet. From Mastaba 4 north side of Senusret II Pyramid at Lahun Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology London. The entrances to the underground chambers were on the southern side of the pyramid which confused Flinders Petrie for some months as he looked for the entrance on the traditional northern side. The builders vertical access shaft had been filled in after construction and the chamber made to look like a burial chamber. This was no doubt an attempt to convince tomb robbers to look no further. A secondary access shaft led to a vaulted chamber and a deep well shaft. This may have been an aspect of the cult of Osiris although it may have been to find the water table. A passage led northwards past another lateral chamber and turned westwards. This led to an antechamber and vaulted burial chamber with a sidechamber to the south. The burial chamber was encircled by a unique series of passages that may have reference to the birth of Osiris. A large sarcophagus was found within the burial chamber it is larger than the doorway and the tunnels showing that it was put in position when the chamber was being constructed and it was open to the sky. The limestone outer cladding of the pyramid was removed by Rameses II so he could reuse the stone for his own use. He left inscriptions that he had done so.
