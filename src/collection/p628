25 th century to mid
24 th century BC during the Old Kingdom. Djedkare succeeded Menkauhor Kaiu and was in turn succeeded by Unas. His relationship to both of these pharaohs remain uncertain although it is often conjectured that Unas was Djedkares son owing to the smooth transition between the two. Djedkare likely enjoyed a reign of more than 40 years which heralded a new period in the history of the Old Kingdom. Breaking with a tradition followed by his predecessors since the time of Userkaf Djedkare did not build a temple to the sun god Ra possibly reflecting the rise of Osiris in the Egyptian pantheon. More significantly Djedkare effected comprehensive reforms of the Egyptian state administration the first undertaken since the inception of the system of ranking titles. He also reorganised the funerary cults of his forebears buried in the necropolis of Abusir and reformed the corresponding priesthood. Djedkare commissioned expeditions to Sinai to procure copper and turquoise to Nubia for its gold and diorite and to the fabled Land of Punt for its incense. One such expedition had what could be the earliest recorded instance of oracular divination undertaken to ensure an expeditions success. The word Nub meaning gold to designate Nubia is first recorded during Djedkares reign. Under his rule Egypt also entertained continuing trade relations with the Levantine coast and made punitive raids in Canaan. In particular one of the earliest depictions of a battle or siege scene was found in the tomb of one of Djedkares subjects. Djedkare is believed to have been buried in a pyramid in Saqqara named Nefer Djedkare Djedkare is perfect which is now ruined owing to theft of stone from its outer casing during antiquity. When excavated in the 19
40 s the burial chamber contained mummified skeletal remains thought to belong to Djedkare. Examinations of the mummy revealed the individual died in his fifties. A clue to the identity of the remains came from skeletal and blood type comparisons with those of two females thought to be Djedkares daughters buried in the nearby Southern Cemetery as Abusir. Radio carbon dating carried out on the effects of the three individuals revealed a common range of 28862507 BC some 160390 years older than the accepted chronology of the 
5 th Dynasty.17 After his death Djedkare was the object of a cult that lasted at least until the end of the Old Kingdom. He seemed to have been held in particularly high esteem during the midSixth Dynasty whose pharaohs lavished rich offerings on his cult. Archaeological evidence suggests the continuing existence of this funerary cult throughout the much later New Kingdom c. 15501077 BC. Djedkare was also remembered by the ancient Egyptians as the Pharaoh of Vizier Ptahhotep the purported author of The Maxims of Ptahhotep one of the earliest pieces of philosophic wisdom literature. The reforms implemented by Djedkare are generally assessed negatively in modern Egyptology as his policy of decentralization created a virtual feudal system that transferred much power to the high and provincial administrations. Some Egyptologists such as Naguib Kanawati argue that this contributed heavily to the collapse of the Egyptian state during the First Intermediate Period c. 200 years later. These conclusions are rejected by Nigel Strudwick who says that in spite of Djedkares reforms Ancient Egyptian officials never amassed enough power to rival that of the king. Attestationsedit Contemporaneous sourcesedit Djedkare is well attested in sources contemporaneous with his reign.note 2 The tombs of many of his courtiers and family members have been discovered in Gizanote 3 Saqqara and Abusir.25 They give insights into the administrative reforms that Djedkare conducted during his reign and in a few cases even record letters that the king sent to his officials.2627 These letters inscribed on the walls of tombs typically present royal praises for the tomb owner.28 Another important source of information about Egypt during the reign of Djedkare is the Abusir papyri. These are administrative documents covering a period of 24 years29 during Djedkares reign they were discovered in the mortuary temples of pharaohs Neferirkare Kakai Neferefre and queen Khentkaus II.30 In addition to these texts the earliest letters on papyrus preserved to the present day also date to Djedkares reign dealing with administrative or private matters.29 Historical sourcesedit Djedkare is attested in four ancient Egyptian king lists all dating to the New Kingdom.31 The earliest of these is the Karnak king list dating to the reign of Thutmose III 14791425 BC where Djedkare is mentioned on the fifth entry. Djedkares prenomen occupies the 
32 nd entry of the Abydos King List which was written during the reign of Seti I 12901279 BC. Djedkare is also present on the Saqqara Tablet 
31 st entry14 where he is listed under the name Maatkare probably because of a scribal error.32 Djedkares prenomen is given as Djed on the Turin canon third column 
24 th row31 probably because of a lacuna affecting the original document from which the canon was copied during the reign of Ramses II 12791213 BC.32 The Turin canon credits Djedkare with 28 years of reign.23233 In addition to these sources Djedkare is mentioned on the Prisse Papyrus dating to the 
12 th Dynasty c.19901800 BC.34 The papyrus records The Maxims of Ptahhotep and gives Djedkares nomen Isesi to name the pharaoh whom the purported authors of the maxims vizier Ptahhotep served.35 Djedkare was also probably mentioned in the Aegyptiaca a history of Egypt written in the 
3 rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II 283246 BC by the Egyptian priest Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is known to us only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. Africanus relates that a pharaoh Tancheres Ancient Greek  reigned for 44 years as the eighth and penultimate king of the Fifth Dynasty.36 Given its position within the dynasty Tancheres is believed to be his Hellenized name.31 Familyedit Parentsedit Isesiankh as depicted on his false door stela37 Djedkares parentage is unknown in particular his relation with his predecessors Menkauhor Kaiu and Nyuserre Ini cannot be ascertained.38 Djedkare is generally thought to have been the son of Menkauhor Kaiu but the two might instead have been brothers and sons of Nyuserre Ini.39 Another hypothesis suggests that Djedkare and Menkauhor could have been cousins39 being sons of Nyuserre and Neferefre respectively.40 The identity of Djedkares mother is similarly unknown.38 Queensedit The name of Djedkares principal wife was Setibhor. This important queen consort whose name was lost but found in 2019 was the owner of a large pyramid complex located to the northeast of Djedkares pyramid in Saqqara.41 This could indicate that she was the mother of Djedkares successor Unas2 or that Djedkare owed the throne to her.4243 The very high status of this queen is suggested by some features of her funerary complex that are otherwise reserved to kings44 her pyramid has its own satellite pyramid has a causeway leading from a valley temple up to a mortuary temple devoted to the cult of the queen and had an entrance hall prwrw an open courtyard and a square antechamber.4345 Furthermore some reliefs showing the queen had been reworked with royal insignia and vultures added above her head.46 Since the construction of the queens pyramid was apparently undertaken after the planning of Djedkares pyramid and her relief had been reworked the Egyptologist Klaus Baer suggests that this queen may have ruled after the death of Djedkare playing an important role in his succession. This is rejected by other Egyptologists such as Michel Baud owing to the lack of evidence for a regency or interregnum between Djedkare and Unas.47 The Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has proposed that this pyramid was initially intended for queen Meresankh IV whom he and Verner see as a wife of Djedkare. Seipel contends that Meresankh was finally buried in a smaller mastaba in Saqqara North after she fell into disgrace.48 Alternatively Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton have proposed that she was a wife of the preceding king Menkauhor Kaiu.49 Sonsedit Wooden statues of Kekheretnebti and in the background of Neserkauhor now in the Nprstek Museum Only one son of Djedkare has been identified for certain Neserkauhor50 who bore the title of eldest beloved kings son of his body.note 45152 Neserkauhor also bore the title of Irypat showing that he was an important member of the royal court as well as a priestly title Greatest of the Five in the temple of Thoth suggesting that he may have been a vizier51 or had similar occupations.52 As well as Neserkauhor there is indirect evidence that princes Raemkanote 5 and Kaemtjenentnote 656 are sons of Djedkare575859 based on the dating and general location of their tombs in Saqqara. For example the tomb of Kaemtjenent mentions vizier Rashepses who served during the reign of Djedkare.6061 Raemka also bore the title of kings son of his body53 almost exclusively reserved to true princes of royal blood.note 7 The locations of Raemkas and Kaemtjenents tombs have led some Egyptologists to believe that both princes are sons58 of queen Meresankh IV buried nearby who would thus be one of Djedkares wives. These conclusions are debated in particular in the case of Kaemtjenent whose title of kings son may have been purely honorific.62 A high official named Isesiankh could have been yet another son of Djedkare as suggested by his name meaning Isesi lives.49 Yet similarities in the titles and locations of the tombsnote 8 of Isesiankh and Kaemtjenent have led Egyptologists to propose that they could instead be brothers and sons of Meresankh IV64 or that the former is a son of the latter.65 Even though Isesiankh bore the title of kings son the Egyptologists Michel Baud and Bettina Schmitz argue that this filiation was fictitious being only an honorary title.6667 Finally the successor of Djedkare Unas is thought to have been his son2 in spite of the complete lack of evidence bearing on the question.68 The main argument in favor of this filiation is that the succession from Djedkare to Unas seems to have been smooth69 as suggested indirectly for example by the Abusir papyri.70 Indirect evidence also comes from the reliefs of Unas causeway which show many officials bearing names incorporating Isesi suggesting at the very least that Unas did not perceive Djedkare as an antagonist.717273 Daughtersedit Several daughters of Djedkare have been identified by the title of kings daughter of his body and the general date of their tomb. These include Kekheretnebtinote 949 whose filiation is clearly indicated by her other title of Beloved of Isesi74 MeretIsesinote 1049 Hedjetnebunote 117549 and Nebtyemneferes.note 1249 Less certain is the filiation of Kentkhaus wife of vizier Senedjemib Mehi who bore the title of kings daughter of his body.7677 It is debated whether this title indicates a true filiation or if it is only honorary.7778 Chronologyedit Alabaster vase bearing an inscription celebrating Djedkares first Sed festival Muse du Louvrenote 1381 The relative chronological position of Djedkare as the eighth and penultimate ruler of the Fifth Dynasty succeeding Menkauhor Kaiu and preceding Unas on the throne is well established by historical sources and confirmed by archaeological evidence.82 The duration of Djedkares reign is much less certain. Djedkares time on the throne is well documented by the Abusir papyri numerous royal seals and contemporary inscriptions taken together they indicate a fairly long rule for this king.note 1485 While the Turin canon credits him with 28 years of reign there is direct evidence for an even longer reign. Several artefacts and inscriptions have been uncovered relating to Djedkares rejuvenation or sed festival normally celebrated only after 30 years of reign. For example the tomb of one of Djedkares viziers Senedjemib Inti relates construction works undertaken during the year of the 
16 th cattle count in preparation for the festival ceremonies. An alabaster vase now on display at the Louvre museumnote 15 bears an inscription celebrating Djedkares first sed festival indicating in all likelihood that he reigned beyond his 
30 th year on the throne.79 One of the Abusir papyri was found to be dated to the Year of the 
22 nd Count IV Akhet day 12 constituting Djedkares latest known date.note 1688 This date might correspond to any time from the 
32 nd year of Djedkares reign up to his 
44 th year on the throne depending on whether the cattle count was once every two years or once every year and a half. The higher estimate is close to Manethos 
44 year figure credited to Tancheres89 the Hellenized name of Djedkare although this may just be coincidental.90 Modern estimates thus put Djedkares reign length as certainly more than 33 years and if the cattle count was regularly biennial at least 42 to 44 years.90 This makes Djedkare the longest reigning king of the Fifth Dynasty.12 Reignedit Statue of Djedkare from the temple of Osiris in Abydos91 The reign of Djedkare heralded a new period in the history of the Old Kingdom.9293 First he did not build a sun temple as his predecessors had done since the time of Userkaf some 80 years earlier.note 179495 This may be a result of the increased prominence of Osiris compared with the sun god Ra during the late Fifth Dynasty.1969798 The rise of Osiris corresponds to changes in the role of the king with respect to the wider Egyptian society. In particular the king loses his role as the sole guarantor of the afterlife which now becomes available beyond the immediate royal circle. These changes demythologise the kings position and as the Egyptologist Hans Goedicke writes make him fully human yet still socially dominant.99 The importance of the cult of Osiris becomes manifest when the Pyramid Texts of the pyramid of Unas are inscribed a few decades later.96100 In this context it is perhaps noteworthy that the only101 known statue of Djedkare was discovered in the ruins of the temple of Osiris in Abydos.91 Another manifestation of the winds of change102 during Djedkares time on the throne is the confirmation of the relocation of the royal necropolis from Abusir where it had been since the reign of Sahure to Saqqara where Menkauhor Kaiu Djedkare and his successor Unas built their pyramids. Abusir may have become overcrowded by the time of Menkauhors accession103 and the capital may have been shifted south to Saqqara along with the royal necropolis around the same time.104 The abandonment of Abusir as a royal necropolis and the termination of sun temple building are possibly related given the close association between the two since the reign of Userkaf.105 Domestic reformsedit Two statues of Ptahhotep a vizier during Djedkares reign106 During his reign Djedkare effected significant reforms of the state administration and priesthood in particular that pertaining to the funerary cults107 in the necropolis of Abusir.note 18108 These evolutions are witnessed by changes in priestly titles and more broadly in the system of ranking titles of high officials which was modified for the first time in its existence.94 For example the priesthood of the royal pyramids was reorganized1 with Djedkare possibly changing the titles and functions of the priests from priest of king to priest of the pyramid109 although this change may have happened earlier under Nyuserre Ini.110 Princes of royal blood could once more hold administrative titlesnote 19 a prerogative they had lost during the early Fifth Dynasty.94 At the same time viziers could now hold the prestigious titles of Irypat93 and Hatya111 and as overseer of the royal scribes became the head of the scribal administration.112 At least one vizier Seshemnefer III even bore the title of kings son of his body one of the most distinguished titles at the time and normally reserved to princes of royal blood. Yet neither Seshemnefer IIIs father nor his mother seems to have belonged to the royal family.113 For the period spanning the reign of Djedkare until that of Teti viziers were furthermore responsible for the weaponry of the state both for military and other purposes.113 Following the reforms undertaken by Djedkare three viziers would be in office at the same time114 two in the Memphite region and a Southern one the governor of Upper Egypt94 with a seat at Abydos.12 In total six viziers were appointed during Djedkares reign.note 20106 Lower ranking officials lost power during the late Fifth Dynasty and were frequently limited to holding only one high title114 a departure from the preceding period.94 Such functions as overseer of the granary and overseer of the treasury disappear from the record some time between Djedkares reign and that of Teti94 while men of lower status became head of the legal administration.112 Consequently the viziers concentrated more power than before while lower echelons of the state administration were reduced.112 At the same time the size of the provincial administration was increased and it also became more autonomous from the central government.2 In particular the nomarchs were responsible in their provinces for performing works hitherto conducted by Memphite officials.112 Building activitiesedit The main building activity undertaken during the reign of Djedkare was the construction of his pyramid complex in Saqqara. Djedkare also either completed or undertook restoration works in the funerary complex of Nyuserre Ini in Abusir as indicated by a now damaged inscription115 which must have detailed Djedkares activities on the site.note 21116 Further building works took place in Abusir during the second half of Djedkares reign following the curious117 decision by members of the royal family to be buried there rather than next to Djedkares pyramid in Saqqara. A group of mastabas was thus constructed for princess Kekheretnebti and her daughter Tisethor princess Hedjetnebu the courtiers Mernefu and Idu who was buried with his wife Khenit and prince Neserkauhor.103117 Djedkare also undertook building activities in relation with his sed festival as indicated by a decree that he sent to his vizier Senedjemib Inti on the year of the 
16 th cattle count118 praising him for his work.119 The decree mentions the construction of a broad rectangular court120 or artificial lake121122 for the jubilee of the king some 1000 cubits long and 400 cubits wide119 amounting to c. 525 m  231 m 1722 ft  758 ft.123124 The court was located within the precincts of a palace built for the ceremonies of the sed festival which was probably located in the vicinity of his pyramid.note 22124 Another decree addressed to Senedjemib Inti and later inscribed on the walls of his mastaba records the decoration of a chapel of Hathor in the palace of the king. This chapel was most likely built during his reign.129 Djedkare may have left some of his monuments unfinished at his death as suggested by several reliefbearing blocks inscribed with his name and which were found reused in the pyramid of king Unas. Their original setting remains unknown.130 A reused granite block with the kings name was also found at the pyramid of Amenemhat I at Lisht.131 Activities outside Egyptedit Drawing by Karl Richard Lepsius of a relief of Djedkare Wadi Maghara132 Expeditions to mines and quarriesedit Three or fournote 23 rock inscriptions dating to Djedkares reign have been found in the Wadi Maghareh in Sinai where mines of copper and semiprecious stones were exploited throughout the Old Kingdom from the Fourth until the Sixth Dynasty.134 These inscriptions record three expeditions sent to look for turquoise the earliest one dated to the third135 or fourth136 cattle countpossibly corresponding to the sixth or eighth year of Dejdkares reignexplicitly recalls the arrival of the mining party to the hills of the turquoisenote 24 after being given divine authority for the finding of semiprecious stones in the writing of the god himself as was enacted in the broad court of the temple Nekhenre.135136 This sentence could indicate the earliest known record of an oracular divination undertaken in order to ensure the success of the expedition prior to its departure Nekhenre being the sun temple of Userkaf.136 Another inscription dating to the year of the ninth cattle countpossibly Djedkares 
18 th year on the throne  shows the king subduing all foreign lands. Smiting the chief of the foreign land.135136 The expedition that left this inscription comprised over 1400 men and administration officials.138139 Some Egyptologists have proposed that these men were also sent to mine copper.140141 These expeditions departed Egypt from the port of Ain Sukhna on the western shore of the Gulf of Suez as revealed by papyri and seals bearing Djedkares name found on the site.142143 The port comprised large galleries carved into the sandstone serving as living quarters and storage places.143 The wall of one such gallery was inscribed with a text mentioning yet another expedition to the hills of turquoise in the year of the seventh cattle countpossibly Djedkares 
14 th year on the throne.137144 In early 2018 more than 220 clay seals bearing the serekh of Djedkare were uncovered in Tell Edfu in the south of Upper Egypt. These seals have been found in close association with copper ore Nubian pottery the remains of two large buildings and a settlement. Edfu called Behdet by the ancient Egyptians was likely the place of departure for the mining expeditions sent to the Eastern desert and the Red Sea during Djedkares reign. These expeditions were undertaken by a special group of prospectors called the sementiu who were under the orders of an administration official sent by the king from Memphis to Edfu.145 Gold cylinder seal bearing the names of Djedkare and Menkauhor Kaiu purportedly from Anatolia146 South of Egypt Djedkare dispatched at least one expedition to the diorite quarries located 65 km 40 mi northwest of Abu Simbel.note 25148 Djedkare was not the first king to do so as these quarries were already exploited during the Fourth Dynasty and continued to be so during the Sixth Dynasty and later in the Middle Kingdom period c.2055 BC  c.1650 BC.147 Djedkare probably also exploited gold mines in the Eastern Desert and in Nubia indeed the earliest mention of the land of gold  an Ancient Egyptian term for Nubianote 26  is found in an inscription from the mortuary temple of Djedkare.150 Trade relationsedit Egypt entertained continuing trade relations with the Levant during Djedkares reign possibly as far north as Anatolia. A gold cylinder seal bearing the serekh of Djedkare together with the cartouche of Menkauhor Kaiu is now on display at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston.note 27146 The seal whose gold may originate from the Pactolus river valley in western Anatolia151 could attest to wideranging tradecontacts during the later Fifth Dynasty2152 but its provenance remains unverifiable.note 28155 Trade contacts with Byblos on the coast of modernday Lebanon are suggested by a fragmentary stone vessel unearthed in the city and bearing the inscription King of Upper and Lower Egypt Djedkare living forever.156157 A biographical inscription discovered in the tomb of Iny a Sixth Dynasty official provides further evidence for an Egyptian expedition to Byblos during Djedkares reign.158 Inys inscription relates his travels to procure lapis lazuli and lead or tin159 for pharaoh Merenre but starts by recounting what must have been similar events taking place under Djedkare.160 To the south of Egypt Djedkare also sent an expedition to the fabled Land of Punt148 to procure the myrrh used as incense in the Egyptian temples.161 The expedition to Punt is referred to in the letter from Pepi II Neferkare to Harkuf some 100 years later. Harkuf had reported that he would bring back a dwarf of the gods dancers from the land of the horizon dwellers. Pepi mentions that the gods sealbearer Werdjededkhnum had returned from Punt with a dwarf during the reign of Djedkare and had been richly rewarded. The decree mentions that My Majesty will do for you something greater than what was done for the gods sealbearer Werdjededkhnum in the reign of Isesi reflecting my majestys yearning to see this dwarf.162 Relief from the tomb of Inti showing a scene of battle or siege163 Djedkares expedition to Punt is also mentioned in a contemporaneous graffito found in Tumas a locality of Lower Nubia some 150 km 93 mi south of Aswan31 where Isesis cartouche was discovered.164 Warfareedit Not all relations between Egypt and its neighbors were peaceful during Djedkares reign. In particular one of the earliest known depictions of a battle or a city being besieged165 is found in the tomb of Inti an official from the 
21 st nome of Upper Egypt who lived during the late Fifth Dynasty.158165 The scene shows Egyptian soldiers scaling the walls of a Near Eastern fortress on ladders.31166 More generally ancient Egyptians seem to have regularly organised punitive raids in Canaan during the later Old Kingdom period but did not attempt to establish a permanent dominion there.167 Pyramidedit Main article Pyramid of Djedkare Isesi The pyramid of Djedkare in Saqqara Djedkare built his pyramid in South Saqqara. It was called Nefer Isesi or Nefer Djedkare in Ancient Egyptiannote 29168 variously translated as IsesiDjedkare is beautiful169 or IsesiDjedkare is perfect.29 It is known today as Haram elShawwf Arabic   romanized Haram ashShawwf lit.The Sentinel Pyramid168 because it stands on the edge of the Nile valley.170171 The pyramid originally comprised six or seven steps made of irregular and roughly hewn limestone blocks and mortar of which only three survive. This core was overlaid by casing stones of white Tura limestone which were stolen in antiquity. At the time of its construction the pyramid stood 52 m 171 ft high with a base length of 
78.7 5 m 2
58.4  ft and an inclination angle of 
52.1 71 In the interior of the pyramid a descending passage led behind three granite portcullises to an antechamber three magazine rooms and the burial chamber. In the burial chamber pieces of alabaster and a faience bead on a gold thread were discovered as well as many fragments of what was originally a large sarcophagus of dark grey basalt.171 The sarcophagus was sunk into the floor of the burial chamber and there was a niche for the canopic chest of the king to its northeast. An almost complete mummy was discovered in the remnants of the sarcophagus. An examination by Ahmed Batrawi of these skeletal remains excavated in the mid19
40 s under the direction of AbdelSalam Hussein suggests that Djedkare died at the age of 50 to 60 years.85172 To the east of the pyramid Djedkares mortuary temple was laid out.173 Its eastern faade was flanked by two massive stone structures which resemble the later pylons. The mortuary temple is connected via a yet unexcavated causeway to a valley temple.173 Legacyedit Impact of the reformsedit The large mastaba of Senedjemib Inti vizier under Djedkare For Nigel Strudwick the reforms of Djedkare were undertaken as a reaction to the rapid growth of the central administration in the first part of the Fifth Dynasty112 which Baer adds had amassed too much political or economic power174 in the eyes of the king.175 Joyce Tyldesley sees the reign of Djedkare as the very beginning of a decline in the importance of the king in conjunction with the gradual rise of the power wielded by the high and provincial administration.176 Concurrent with this trend is a process of decentralization with local loyalties slowly superseding allegiance to the central state.176 Since offices and the vizierate in particular could be inherited2 the reforms of Djedkare created a virtual feudal system as Nicolas Grimal writes148177 with much power in the hands of a few puissant officials. This is best witnessed by the large magnificent mastaba tombs that Djedkares viziers built.148 In this context Djedkares reforms of the ranking system might have been an attempt at maintaining a sprawling administration under control114 yet ultimately failed. For some Egyptologists such as Naguib Kanawati this failure contributed in no small part to the fall of the Old Kingdom178 but others including Strudwick believe the reasons of the collapse must be sought elsewhere as the power of an administration official never approached that of the king.174 The reforms of Djedkare played an important role in flourishing of the arts during the later Old Kingdom as artisans and craftsmen could now find many wealthy patrons beyond the king. This created a surge in the number of commissions leading to a general improvement of the artistic works. This also provided the artisans with a new wealth which they used to build their own large funerary complexes.2 Funerary cultedit Old Kingdomedit Personified agricultural estate of Djedkare called Ra desires that Isesi lives179 Djedkare was the object of a funerary cult established at his death and which lasted until the end of the Old Kingdom nearly 200 years later. Provisions for this cult were produced in several agricultural estates set up during Djedkares reign.

For example Merenre Nemtyemsaf I chose to place his pyramid complex close to that of Djedkare.184 In addition the South Saqqara Stone a royal annal dating to the reign of Merenre or of his successor Pepi II185 records rich offerings being made to Djedkare on behalf of the king.note 43186187 An estimated 92188 of the text inscribed on the stone was lost when it was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid possibly in the late First Intermediate c.21602055 BC to early Middle Kingdom period c.20551650 BC.189 More generally an historical or literary tradition concerning events in the time of Djedkare seems to have flourished toward the end of Old Kingdom as can be inferred from the tombs of Harkuf and Iny.190 These two officials were in charge of expeditions to foreign landsPunt and Byblos under Merenre I and Pepi II and both relate similar expeditions that took place during the time of Djedkare.190 New Kingdomedit The funerary cult of Djedkare enjoyed a revival during the New Kingdom c. 15501077 BC. For the early part of this period this is best attested by the Karnak king list a list of kings commissioned by pharaoh Thutmose III. The list was not meant to be exhaustive rather it gave the names of Thutmoses forefathers whom he wanted to honor by dedicating offerings.191 For the later New Kingdom a relief from the Saqqara tomb of the priest Mehu dating to the 
19 th or 
20 th Dynasty shows three gods faced by several deceased pharaohs. These are Djoser and Sekhemket of the Third Dynasty and Userkaf founder of the Fifth Dynasty. He is followed by a fourth king whose name is damaged but which is often read Djedkare or much less likely Shepseskare. The relief is an expression of personal piety on Mehus behalf who prayed to the ancient kings for them to recommend him to the gods.192 See alsoedit List of pharaohs Notesedit  Proposed dates for Djedkare Isesis reign 24362404 BC123 24142375 BC45678 24052367 BC9 23802342 BC10 23792352 BC11 23652322 BC.12  Numerous artefacts bearing Djedkares nomen prenomen or serekh have been unearthed which provide information about trade relations or the state administration during Djedkares reign. These artifacts are now scattered throughout the world in many museums including the Louvre Museum18 the Petrie Museum1920 the Metropolitan Museum of Art21 the Boston Museum of Fine Arts22 and the Egyptian Museum of Berlin.23  Cemetery 2000 in Giza contains several tombs of overseers and inspectors of the palace attendants who lived during Djedkares reign.24  Neserkauhor was buried in mastaba C south of Nyuserres pyramid complex in the east of the Abusir necropolis.51  Prince Raemka was buried in the mastaba tomb S80 also known as mastaba D3 and QS 903 in Saqqara north of Djosers pyramid.50 His tomb seems to have been usurped53 from a certain Neferiretnes.54 The chapel from Raemkas tomb is now on display in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.55  Prince Kaemtjenent was buried in the mastaba tomb S84 in Saqqara.50  As opposed to those bearing the title kings son which was used as an honorary title during the later Fifth Dynasty.  Isesiankh was buried in mastaba D8 north of the pyramid of Djoser in Saqqara.63  Kekheretnebti is believed to have died in her early thirties she was buried in mastaba B in east Abusir south of the pyramid complex of Nyuserre.74 She had a daughter named Tisethor who was buried in an extension of her tomb.49  Probably buried in Abusir.49  Buried in the mastaba K south of Nyuserres complex in Abusir75 likely prior to the building of Tisethors tomb.  Buried in Abusir.49  The inscription reads First occasion of the Sed festival of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Djedkare beloved of the bas of Heliopolis given life stability and all joy for ever.7980  The years of

23.8 6  Miroslav Verner writes that Paule PosenerKriger and JeanLouis de Cenival transcribed the year date numeral in the papyrus as the year of the 
21 st count in their 1968 study of the Abusir papyri.87 Verner notes that in the damaged place where the numeral still is one can see a tiny black trace of another vertical stroke just visible. Therefore the numeral can probably be reconstructed as 
22.8 8  With the possible exception of Shepseskare who might not have the time required to start one.  The abandonment of Abusir as the royal necropolis meant that Djedkare had to strictly regulate its activities so as to ensure the proper continuation of the funerary cults taking place there which explains in large part the administrative content of the Abusir papyri.108  The Egyptologist Nigel Strudwick illustrates this novelty with the cases of Isesiankh and Kaemtjenent who both bore the title of kings son as well as a number of administrative titles such as overseer of all the works of the king and seal bearer of the god.63 The Egyptologists Michel Baud and Bettina Schmitz have argued that the title of kings son here does not denote a true filiation and was only honorary at least in the case of Isesiankh.6766 More generally Baud and Schmitz consider that true princes of blood were qualified of smsw z3 nswt for eldest kings son and remained excluded from holding administrative offices.111  These are Ptahhotep Desher Seshemnefer III Ptahhotep Rashepses another Ptahhotep and Senedjemib Inti.106  The block inscribed with the text relating Djedkares works in the temple of Nyuserre reads Horus Djedkhau the king of Upper and Lower Egypt the Two Ladies Djedkhau the Golden Horus Djed Djedkare. For the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Nyuserre he set up a monument ....115 It is now in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin catalog No. 179
33.2 3  The name of the palace mentioned in the decree has been the subject of varying translations owing to the damaged state of the inscription. For Brovarski and Sethe the palace is simply called the jubilee palace in the decree125 while others such as Breasted126 Roccati127 and Trigger124 have read the palace name as lotusblossom of Isesi or lotus of Isesi Ancient Egyptian Nehbet. Wente reads the jubilee palace of LotusofIzezi.128  It is unclear whether two of the inscribed texts originate from the same damaged inscription or have always been part of two different inscriptions.133  Also translated as terraces of turquoise from the Egyptian tjw mfk
3 t.137  The rock exploited in these quarries actually comprises two varieties of gneiss the word diorite being misused by Egyptologists to designate these.147  Gold is Nub in Ancient Egyptian and the land of gold may have given rise to the modern word Nubia149  The golden seal has the catalog number
