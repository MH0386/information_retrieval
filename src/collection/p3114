The Egyptian language or Ancient Egyptian r n km.t16 is an extinct branch of the AfroAsiatic languages that was spoken in ancient Egypt. It is known today from a large corpus of surviving texts which were made accessible to the modern world following the decipherment of the ancient Egyptian scripts in the early 
19 th century. Egyptian is one of the earliest known written languages first recorded in the hieroglyphic script in the late 
4 th millennium BC. It is also the longestattested human language with a written record spanning over 4000 years.7 Its classical form is known as Middle Egyptian. This was the vernacular of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt and it remained the literary language of Egypt until the Roman period. By the time of classical antiquity the spoken language had evolved into Demotic and by the Roman era it had diversified into the Coptic dialects. These were eventually supplanted by Arabic after the Muslim conquest of Egypt although Bohairic Coptic remains in use as the liturgical language of the Coptic Church.
8 note 2 Classificationedit The Egyptian language branch belongs to the Afroasiatic language family.910 Among the typological features of Egyptian that are typically Afroasiatic are its fusional morphology nonconcatenative morphology a series of emphatic consonants a threevowel system a i u nominal feminine suffix at nominal m adjectival  and characteristic personal verbal affixes.9 Of the other Afroasiatic branches linguists have variously suggested that the Egyptian language shares its greatest affinities with Berber11 and Semitic101213 languages particularly Arabiccitation needed which is spoken in Egypt today and Hebrew.10 However other scholars have argued that the Egyptian language shared closer linguistic ties with northeastern African regions.141516 There are two theories that seek to establish the cognate sets between Egyptian and Afroasiatic the traditional theory and the neuere Komparatistik founded by Semiticist Otto Rssler.17 According to the neuere Komparatistik in Egyptian the ProtoAfroasiatic voiced consonants d z  developed into pharyngeal   Egyptian r.t portal Semitic dalt door. The traditional theory instead disputes the values given to those consonants by the neuere Komparatistik instead connecting  with Semitic  and .18 Both schools agree that Afroasiatic l merged with Egyptian n r  and j in the dialect on which the written language was based but it was preserved in other Egyptian varieties. They also agree that original k g  palatalise to  j  in some environments and are preserved as k g q in others.1920 The Egyptian language has many biradical and perhaps monoradical roots in contrast to the Semitic preference for triradical roots. Egyptian is probably more conservative and Semitic likely underwent later regularizations converting roots into the triradical pattern.21 Although Egyptian is the oldest Afroasiatic language documented in written form its morphological repertoire is very different from that of the rest of the Afroasiatic languages in general and Semitic languages in particular. There are multiple possibilities perhaps Egyptian had already undergone radical changes from ProtoAfroasiatic before it was recorded or the Afroasiatic family has so far been studied with an excessively Semitocentric approach or as G. W. Tsereteli suggests Afroasiatic is an allogenetic rather than a genetic group of languages.22 Historyedit The Egyptian language can be grouped thus2324 Egyptian Earlier Egyptian Older Egyptian or Classical Egyptian Old Egyptian Early Egyptian Early Old Egyptian Archaic Old Egyptian PreOld Egyptian or archaic Egyptian standard Old Egyptian Middle Egyptian Later Egyptian Late Egyptian Demotic Egyptian Coptic The Egyptian language is conventionally grouped into six major chronological divisions25 Archaic Egyptian before 2600 BC the reconstructed language of the Early Dynastic Period Old Egyptian c.2600  2000 BC the language of the Old Kingdom Middle Egyptian c.2000  1350 BC the language of the Middle Kingdom to early New Kingdom and continuing on as a literary language into the 
4 th century Late Egyptian c.1350  700 BC Amarna period to Third Intermediate Period Demotic Egyptian c.700 BC  400 AD the vernacular of the Late Period Ptolemaic and early Roman Egypt Coptic after c.200 AD the vernacular at the time of Christianisation and the liturgical language of Egyptian Christianity. Old Middle and Late Egyptian were all written using both the hieroglyphic and hieratic scripts. Demotic is the name of the script derived from the hieratic beginning in the 
7 th century BC. The Coptic alphabet was derived from the Greek alphabet with adaptations for Egyptian phonology. It was first developed in the Ptolemaic period and gradually replaced the Demotic script in about the 
4 th to 
5 th centuries of the Christian era. Diagram showing the use of the various lects of Egyptian by time period and linguistic register. Old Egyptianedit Seal impression from the tomb of SethPeribsen containing the oldest known complete sentence in Egyptian The term Archaic Egyptian is sometimes reserved for the earliest use of hieroglyphs from the late fourth through the early third millennia BC. At the earliest stage around 3300 BC26 hieroglyphs were not a fully developed writing system being at a transitional stage of protowriting over the time leading up to the 
27 th century BC grammatical features such as nisba formation can be seen to occur.2627 Old Egyptian is dated from the oldest known complete sentence including a finite verb which has been found. Discovered in the tomb of SethPeribsen dated c.2690 BC the seal impression reads dm.n.f twj n z.f nsw.tbj.tj prjb.snj unite.PRF.he28 land.two for son.his sedgebee househeart.their He has united the Two Lands for his son Dual King Peribsen.29 Extensive texts appear from about 2600 BC.27 The Pyramid Texts are the largest body of literature written in this phase of the language. One of its distinguishing characteristics is the tripling of ideograms phonograms and determinatives to indicate the plural. Overall it does not differ significantly from Middle Egyptian the classical stage of the language though it is based on a different dialect. In the period of the 
3 rd dynasty c.2650  c.2575 BC many of the principles of hieroglyphic writing were regularized. From that time on until the script was supplanted by an early version of Coptic about the third and fourth centuries the system remained virtually unchanged. Even the number of signs used remained constant at about 700 for more than 2000 years.30 Middle Egyptianedit Middle Egyptian was spoken for about 700 years beginning around 2000 BC during the Middle Kingdom and the subsequent Second Intermediate Period.12 As the classical variant of Egyptian Middle Egyptian is the bestdocumented variety of the language and has attracted the most attention by far from Egyptology. While most Middle Egyptian is seen written on monuments by hieroglyphs it was also written using a cursive variant and the related hieratic.31 Middle Egyptian first became available to modern scholarship with the decipherment of hieroglyphs in the early 
19 th century. The first grammar of Middle Egyptian was published by Adolf Erman in 1894 surpassed in 1927 by Alan Gardiners work. Middle Egyptian has been wellunderstood since then although certain points of the verbal inflection remained open to revision until the mid
20 th century notably due to the contributions of Hans Jakob Polotsky.3233 The Middle Egyptian stage is taken to have ended around the 
14 th century BC giving rise to Late Egyptian. This transition was taking place in the later period of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt known as the Amarna Period.citation needed Egyptien de traditionedit Main article Egyptien de tradition Original Old Egyptian and Middle Egyptian texts were still used after the 
14 th century BCE. And an emulation of predominately Middle Egyptian but also with characteristics of Old Egyptian Late Egyptian and Demotic called gyptien de tradition or NeoMiddle Egyptian by scholars was used as a literary language for new texts since the later New Kingdom in official and religious hieroglyphic and hieratic texts in preference to Late Egyptian or Demotic. gyptien de tradition as a religious language survived until the Christianisation of Roman Egypt in the 
4 th century. Late Egyptianedit Late Egyptian was spoken for about 650 years beginning around 1350 BC during the New Kingdom of Egypt. Late Egyptian succeeded but did not fully supplant Middle Egyptian as a literary language and was also the language of the New Kingdom administration.634 Texts written wholly in Late Egyptian date to the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt and later. Late Egyptian is represented by a large body of religious and secular literature comprising such examples as the Story of Wenamun the love poems of the ChesterBeatty I papyrus and the Instruction of Any. Instructions became a popular literary genre of the New Kingdom which took the form of advice on proper behavior. Late Egyptian was also the language of New Kingdom administration.3536 Late Egyptian is not completely distinct from Middle Egyptian as many classicisms appear in historical and literary documents of this phase.37 However the difference between Middle and Late Egyptian is greater than the difference between Middle and Old Egyptian. Originally a synthetic language Egyptian by the Late Egyptian phase had become an analytic language.38 The relationship between Middle Egyptian and Late Egyptian has been described as being similar to that between Latin and Italian.39 Written Late Egyptian was seemingly a better representative than Middle Egyptian of the spoken language in the New Kingdom and beyond weak consonants  w j as well as the feminine ending .t were increasingly dropped apparently because they stopped being pronounced. The demonstrative pronouns p masc. t fem. and n pl. were used as definite articles. The old form sm.n.f he heard of the verb was replaced by smf which had both prospective he shall hear and perfective he heard aspects. The past tense was also formed using the auxiliary verb jr make as in jr.f saa.f he has accused him. Adjectives as attributes of nouns are often replaced by nouns. The Late Egyptian stage is taken to have ended around the 
8 th century BC giving rise to Demotic. Demoticedit 
10 th century stela with Coptic inscription in the Louvre Demotic is a later development of the Egyptian language written in the Demotic script following Late Egyptian and preceding Coptic the latter of which it shares much with. In the earlier stages of Demotic such as those texts written in the early Demotic script it probably represented the spoken idiom of the time. However as its use became increasingly confined to literary and religious purposes the written language diverged more and more from the spoken form leading to significant diglossia between the late Demotic texts and the spoken language of the time similar to the use of classical Middle Egyptian during the Ptolemaic Period. Copticedit Main article Coptic language Coptic is the name given to the late Egyptian vernacular when it was written in a Greekbased alphabet the Coptic alphabet it flourished from the time of Early Christianity c. 3133324 but Egyptian phrases written in the Greek alphabet first appeared during the Hellenistic period c.
3 rd century BC40 with the first known Coptic text still pagan Old Coptic from the 
1 st century AD. Coptic survived into the medieval period but by the 
16 th century was dwindling rapidly due to the persecution of Coptic Christians under the Mamluks. It probably survived in the Egyptian countryside as a spoken language for several centuries after that. Coptic survives as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Coptic Catholic Church. Dialectsedit Most hieroglyphic Egyptian texts are written in a literary prestige register rather than the vernacular speech variety of their author. As a result dialectical differences are not apparent in written Egyptian until the adoption of the Coptic alphabet.34 Nevertheless it is clear that these differences existed before the Coptic period. In one Late Egyptian letter dated c.1200 BC a scribe jokes that his colleagues writing is incoherent like the speech of a Delta man with a man of Elephantine.34 Recently some evidence of internal dialects has been found in pairs of similar words in Egyptian that based on similarities with later dialects of Coptic may be derived from northern and southern dialects of Egyptian.41 Written Coptic has five major dialects which differ mainly in graphic conventions most notably the southern Saidic dialect the main classical dialect and the northern Bohairic dialect currently used in Coptic Church services.34 Writing systemsedit Most surviving texts in the Egyptian language are written on stone in hieroglyphs. The native name for Egyptian hieroglyphic writing is z n mdwnr writing of the gods words.
42 citation needed In antiquity most texts were written on perishable papyrus in hieratic and later demotic. There was also a form of cursive hieroglyphs used for religious documents on papyrus such as the Book of the Dead of the Twentieth Dynasty it was simpler to write than the hieroglyphs in stone inscriptions but it was not as cursive as hieratic and lacked the wide use of ligatures. Additionally there was a variety of stonecut hieratic known as lapidary hieratic.citation needed In the languages final stage of development the Coptic alphabet replaced the older writing system. Hieroglyphs are employed in two ways in Egyptian texts as ideograms to represent the idea depicted by the pictures and more commonly as phonograms to represent their phonetic value. As the phonetic realisation of Egyptian cannot be known with certainty Egyptologists use a system of transliteration to denote each sound that could be represented by a uniliteral hieroglyph.43 Egyptian scholar Gamal Mokhtar argued that the inventory of hieroglyphic symbols derived from fauna and flora used in the signs which are essentially African and in regards to writing we have seen that a purely Nilotic hence African origin not only is not excluded but probably reflects the reality although he acknowledged the geographical location of Egypt made it a receptacle for many influences.44 Phonologyedit Further information Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian While the consonantal phonology of the Egyptian language may be reconstructed the exact phonetics is unknown and there are varying opinions on how to classify the individual phonemes. In addition because Egyptian is recorded over a full 2000 years the Archaic and Late stages being separated by the amount of time that separates Old Latin from Modern Italian significant phonetic changes must have occurred during that lengthy time frame.45 Phonologically Egyptian contrasted labial alveolar palatal velar uvular pharyngeal and glottal consonants. Egyptian also contrasted voiceless and emphatic consonants as with other Afroasiatic languages but exactly how the emphatic consonants were realised is unknown. Early research had assumed that the opposition in stops was one of voicing but it is now thought to be either one of tenuis and emphatic consonants as in many Semitic languages or one of aspirated and ejective consonants as in many Cushitic languages.note 3 Since vowels were not written until Coptic reconstructions of the Egyptian vowel system are much more uncertain and rely mainly on evidence from Coptic and records of Egyptian words especially proper nouns in other languageswriting systems.46 The actual pronunciations reconstructed by such means are used only by a few specialists in the language. For all other purposes the Egyptological pronunciation is used but it often bears little resemblance to what is known of how Egyptian was pronounced. Old Egyptianedit Consonantsedit The following consonants are reconstructed for Archaic before 2600 BC and Old Egyptian 26862181 BC with IPA equivalents in square brackets if they differ from the usual transcription scheme Early Egyptian consonants47 Labial Alveolar Postalveolar Palatal Velar Uvular Pharyngeal Glottal Nasal m n Plosive voiceless p t  c k qa  voiced b da a  a Fricative voiceless f s         h voiced za    Approximant w l j Trill r     a b c d e Possibly unvoiced ejectives. l has no independent representation in the hieroglyphic orthography and it is frequently written as if it were n or r.47 That is probably because the standard for written Egyptian is based on a dialect in which l had merged with other sonorants.19 Also the rare cases of  occurring are not represented. The phoneme j is written as j in the initial position jt  jatVj father and immediately after a stressed vowel bjn  bajin bad and as jj wordmedially immediately before a stressed vowel jjk  ajak you will appear and are unmarked wordfinally jt  jatVj father.47 Middle Egyptianedit In Middle Egyptian 20551650 BC a number of consonantal shifts take place. By the beginning of the Middle Kingdom period z and s had merged and the graphemes s and z are used interchangeably.48 In addition j had become  wordinitially in an unstressed syllable jwn jawin  awin colour and after a stressed vowel jpw ujpVw  epVw the god Apis.49 Late Egyptianedit In Late Egyptian 1069700 BC the phonemes d  g gradually merge with their counterparts t  k dbn diban  Akkadian transcription tibaan dbnweight. Also   often become t d but they are retained in many lexemes  becomes  and t r j w become  at the end of a stressed syllable and eventually null wordfinally p.t piat  Akkadian transcription pita bow.50 Demoticedit Phonologyedit The most important source of information about Demotic phonology is Coptic. The consonant inventory of Demotic can be reconstructed on the basis of evidence from the Coptic dialects.51 Demotic orthography is relatively opaque. The Demotic alphabetical signs are mostly inherited from the hieroglyphic script and due to historical sound changes they do not always map neatly onto Demotic phonemes. However the Demotic script does feature certain orthographic innovations such as the use of the sign h for 52 which allow it to represent sounds that were not present in earlier forms of Egyptian. The Demotic consonants can be divided into two primary classes obstruents stops affricates and fricatives and sonorants approximants nasals and semivowels.53 Voice is not a contrastive feature all obstruents are voiceless and all sonorants are voiced.54 Stops may be either aspirated or tenuis unaspirated55 although there is evidence that aspirates merged with their tenuis counterparts in certain environments.56 The following table presents the consonants of Demotic Egyptian.

These texts exhibit a variety of orthographic and dialectal features and notably make use of several letters of Demotic origin which are not found in the standard Coptic script. The minor dialects P and I are sometimes grouped under the Old Coptic umbrella however strictly speaking Dialect I is written with a modified version of the Sahidic alphabet which it shares with Akhmimic rather than a genuine Old Coptic system.  p is an allophone of p in Demotic.

According to some scholars that is a development from a stage in ProtoEgyptian in which the thirdlast syllable could be stressed which was lost as open posttonic syllables lost their vowels upiraw  upraw transformation.69 Egyptological pronunciationedit As a convention Egyptologists make use of an Egyptological pronunciation in English the consonants are given fixed values and vowels are inserted according to essentially arbitrary rules. Two of these consonants known as alef and ayin are generally pronounced as the vowel . Yodh is pronounced i w u. Between other consonants  is then inserted. Thus for example the Egyptian name Ramesses is most accurately transliterated as rmssw Ra is the one who bore him and pronounced as rmssu. In transcription a i and u all represent consonants. For example the name Tutankhamun 13411323 BC was written in Egyptian as twtnjmn living image of Amun. Experts have assigned generic sounds to these values as a matter of convenience which is an artificial pronunciation and should not be mistaken for how Egyptian was ever pronounced at any time. So although twtnmn is pronounced tutnkmn in modern Egyptological pronunciation in his lifetime it was likely to be pronounced something like twat an aman707172737475 transliterable as twtnkhamn. Morphologyedit Egyptian is fairly typical for an Afroasiatic language in that at the heart of its vocabulary is most commonly a root of three consonants but there are sometimes only two consonants in the root rw ria sunthe  is thought to have been something like a voiced pharyngeal fricative. Larger roots are also common and can have up to five consonants sdd be upsidedown. Vowels and other consonants are added to the root to derive different meanings as Arabic Hebrew and other Afroasiatic languages still do. However because vowels and sometimes glides are not written in any Egyptian script except Coptic it can be difficult to reconstruct the actual forms of words. Thus orthographic stp to choose for example can represent the stative whose endings can be left unexpressed the imperfective forms or even a verbal noun a choosing. Nounsedit Egyptian nouns can be masculine or feminine the latter is indicated as with other Afroasiatic languages by adding a t and singular or plural w  wt or dual wj  tj. Articles both definite and indefinite do not occur until Late Egyptian but are used widely thereafter. Pronounsedit Egyptian has three different types of personal pronouns suffix enclitic called dependent by Egyptologists and independent pronouns. There are also a number of verbal endings added to the infinitive to form the stative and are regarded by some linguists76 as a fourth set of personal pronouns. They bear close resemblance to their Semitic counterparts. The three main sets of personal pronouns are as follows Personal pronouns Suffix Dependent Independent

Finite verbs convey person tenseaspect mood and voice. Each is indicated by a set of affixal morphemes attached to the verb For example the basic conjugation is sm to hear is sm.f he hears. Nonfinite verbs occur without a subject and are the infinitive the participles and the negative infinitive which Egyptian Grammar Being an Introduction to the Study of Hieroglyphs calls negatival complement. There are two main tensesaspects in Egyptian past and temporallyunmarked imperfective and aorist forms. The latter are determined from their syntactic context. Adjectivesedit Adjectives agree in gender and number with the nouns they modify z man nfr good.MASC z nfr man good.MASC the good man zt woman nfrt good.FEM zt nfrt woman good.FEM the good woman Attributive adjectives in phrases are after the nouns they modify nr  the great god. However when they are used independently as a predicate in an adjectival phrase as  nr the god is great lit. great is the god adjectives precede the nouns they modify. Prepositionsedit Egyptian makes use of prepositions. m in as with from n to for r to at jn or n by n with mj or m like r on upon  behind around r under tp atop r since Adverbsedit Adverbs in Egyptian are at the end of a sentence For example z.n went nr god m there z.n nr m went god there the god went there Here are some common Egyptian adverbs jm or m there  here nj or n where zynw when lit. which moment mjj or m how lit. likewhat rmj or rm why lit. for what nt before Syntaxedit Old Egyptian Classical Egyptian and Middle Egyptian have verbsubjectobject as the basic word order. For example the equivalent of he opens the door would be wn s  opens he the door. The socalled construct state combines two or more nouns to express the genitive as in Semitic and Berber languages. However that changed in the later stages of the language including Late Egyptian Demotic and Coptic. The early stages of Egyptian have no articles but the later forms use p t and n. As with other Afroasiatic languages Egyptian uses two grammatical genders masculine and feminine. It also uses three grammatical numbers singular dual and plural. However later Egyptian has a tendency to lose the dual as a productive form. Legacyedit Further information Coptic language  Influence on other languages The Egyptian language survived through the Middle Ages and into the early modern period in the form of the Coptic language. Coptic survived past the 
16 th century only as an isolated vernacular and as a liturgical language for the Coptic Orthodox and Coptic Catholic Churches. Coptic also had an enduring effect on Egyptian Arabic which replaced Coptic as the main daily language in Egypt the Coptic substratum in Egyptian Arabic appears in certain aspects of syntax and to a lesser degree in vocabulary and phonology. In antiquity Egyptian exerted some influence on Classical Greek so that a number of Egyptian loanwords into Greek survive into modern usage. Examples include ebony Egyptian hbnj via Greek and then Latin ivory Egyptian bw via Latin natron Egyptian nrj via Greek lily Egyptian rrt Coptic hlri via Greek ibis Egyptian hbj via Greek oasis Egyptian wt via Greek barge Egyptian bjr via Greek possibly catnote 6 pharaoh Egyptian pr  lit. great house via Hebrew and Greek The Hebrew Bible also contains some words terms and names that are thought by scholars to be Egyptian in origin. An example of this is ZaphnathPaaneah the Egyptian name given to Joseph. The etymological root of Egypt is the same as Copts ultimately from the Late Egyptian name of Memphis Hikuptah a continuation of Middle Egyptian wtkpt lit. temple of the ka soul of Ptah.77 See alsoedit Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae Ancient Egyptian literature Coptic language Egyptian Arabic Egyptian hieroglyphs Egyptian numerals Hieratic Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian Notesedit  Whence the designation Kemic for EgyptoCoptic with km.t kmt black land Egypt as opposed to r.t red land desert. Proposed by Schenkel 19901  a b The language may have survived in isolated pockets in Upper Egypt as late as the 
19 th century according to Quibell James Edward 1901. When did Coptic become extinct. Zeitschrift fr gyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde. 39 87. In the village of PiSolsel AzZayniyyah El Zenya or Al Zeniya north of Luxor passive speakers were recorded as late as the 19
30 s and traces of traditional vernacular Coptic reported to exist in other places such as Abydos and Dendera see Vycichl Werner 1936. PiSolsel ein Dorf mit koptischer berlieferung PiSolsel a village with Coptic tradition PDF. Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archologischen Instituts Abteilung Kairo MDAIK in German. 6 169175.  See Peust 1999 for a review of the history of thinking on the subject his reconstructions of words are nonstandard.  There is evidence of Bohairic having a phonemic glottal stop Loprieno 199544.  In other dialects the graphemes are used only for clusters of a stop followed by h and were not used for aspirates see Loprieno 1995248.  Possibly the precursor of Coptic au tomcat suffixed with feminine t but some authorities dispute this e.g. Huehnergard John 2007. Qia Arabic Cats. Classical Arabic Humanities in Their Own Terms. doi
