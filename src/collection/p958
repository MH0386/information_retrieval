62.5 615 sq mi Dahshurtransliteration 1 in English often called Dashur Arabic  Dahr pronounced dhu Coptic  Dahchur1 is an ancient Egyptian pyramid complex and necropolis and shares the name of the nearby village of Manshiyyat Dahshur Arabic   in markaz Badrashin Giza.2 Dahshur is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is located on the Western Desert plateau at the edge of the cultivated plain and along with the pyramid complexes at Saqqara Abusir and Giza to its north forms the pyramid fields of the ancient capital city of Memphis.3 It is known chiefly for several pyramids mainly Senefrus Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid which are among the oldest largest and best preserved in Egypt built from 2613 to 2589 BC. Pyramidsedit Sneferus Bent Pyramid The Dahshur pyramids were an extremely important learning experience for the Egyptians. It provided them with the knowledge and knowhow to transition from stepsided pyramids to smoothsided pyramids. Ultimately their breadth of experience would allow them to build the Great Pyramid of Giza the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing to this date. The first of the Dahshur pyramids was the Bent Pyramid 26132589 BC built under the rule of King Sneferu. The Bent Pyramid was the first attempt at building a smooth sided pyramid but proved to be an unsuccessful build due to the miscalculations made on the structural weight that was being placed onto the soft ground sand gravel and clay which had a tendency to subside. Other calculations that were proven to be erroneous were that the blocks being used were cut in such a manner that when placed onto the pyramid their weight was not distributed appropriately causing the angle of the pyramid to be off and achieving the name the Bent Pyramid.4 Realizing his shortcomings and learning from his mistakes King Sneferu ordered the building of the second pyramid of Dahshur the Red Pyramid. Once completed the pyramid was considered to be a success as it was a fully constructed smooth sided and a free standing pyramid rising to a height of 341 feet 104 meters with an angle of 43 degrees.5 The Red Pyramids name derives from the material that was used to construct the pyramid red limestone. This pyramid is believed to be the resting place of King Sneferu.6 Shortly after King Sneferus death a third pyramid was erected by his son Khufu. Khufu wanting to build a legacy of his own utilized his fathers research to design and guide the building process of the third pyramid to completion 25892566 BC.7 Once completed the pyramid was named the Great Pyramid of Giza and it stands an astonishing 481 feet 147 meters tall with an angle of 52 degrees.8 The Black Pyramid Another pyramid the White Pyramid located within Dahshur is that of the 
12 th Dynasty King Amenemhat II 19291895 BC. This pyramid has not been preserved as well as the others within the area due to the materials that were used to fill it sand on the outside and limestone on the inside. Naturally the weather caused the sand to erode from it but the limestone was taken intentionally for use on other pyramids allowing the pyramid to collapse and ultimately desecrating the tomb of King Amenemhat II.9 King Senusret III 18781839 BC had his pyramid built within Dahshur. The difference between his pyramid in comparison to those surrounding it was that King Senusret III had tombs and galleries built underneath it for two princesses SitHathor and Merit.10 The Black Pyramid dates from the later reign of Amenemhat III and although badly eroded it remains the most imposing monument at the site after the two Sneferu pyramids. The polished granite pyramidion or capstone of the Black Pyramid is on display in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The Pyramids of Dahshoor From the East by Francis Frith 1857 Several other pyramids of the 
13 th Dynasty were built at Dahshur. Only the Pyramid of Ameny Qemau has been excavated so far by Ahmad Fakhri the archaeologist who excavated this site. Tombs and cemeteriesedit Located closely to the pyramid of the 
12 th Dynasty several undisturbed tombs of royal women were found containing a large amount of lapidary and jewelry that have been determined to be of the highest stage of metalworking in Egypt during this time period. The pyramid of Senusret III was part of a huge complex with several smaller pyramids of royal women along with another pyramid to the south. In a gallery tomb next to this pyramid were found two treasures of the kings daughters Sithathor. Extensive cemeteries of officials of the Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom have been found around Dahshurs pyramids. Dahshur was Egypts royal necropolis during the reign of the 
12 th Dynasty king Amenemhat II. Contemporary historyedit In July 2012 Dahshurs entire Christian community which some estimate to be as many as 120 families fled to nearby towns due to sectarian violence. The violence began in a dispute over a badly ironed shirt which in turn escalated into a fight in which a Christian burned a Muslim Arab clan member to death. Furthermore during clashes another Muslim suffered head injuries and later died due to a gasoline bomb being thrown from a rooftop of a building. At least 16 homes and properties of Christians were pillaged some were torched and a church was damaged during the violence. This incident was reported internationally.11 As of January 2013 and due to the security vacuum that still prevails in Egypt following the 2011 uprising the site is under threat of desecration and damage due to encroachment by locals of surrounding urban settlements.12 Climateedit Dahshur has a hot desert climate BWh according to the KppenGeiger climate classification system.
