The Twentyfirst Twentysecond Twentythird Twentyfourth and Twentyfifth dynasties of ancient Egypt are often combined under the group designation of the Third Intermediate Period. Rulersedit The pharaohs of the Twentysecond Dynasty were a series of Meshwesh ancient Libyana tribe chieftains who ruled from c. 943 BC until 716 BC. They had settled in Egypt since the Twentieth Dynasty and were known in Egypt as the Great Chiefs of the Ma Ma being a synonym of Meshwesh. Manetho states that this Egyptianized ancient Libyan dynasty first ruled over Bubastis but its rulers almost certainly governed from Tanis which was their capital and the city where their tombs have been excavated. Another pharaoh who belongs to this group is Tutkheperre Shoshenq. His period of rule within this dynasty is currently uncertain although he is now thought to have governed Egypt early in the 
9 th century BC for a short time between Osorkon I and Takelot I. The next ruler at Tanis after Shoshenq V was Osorkon IV. This pharaoh is sometimes not believed to be a member of the 
22 nd Dynasty since he only controlled a small portion of Lower Egypt together with Tefnakhte of Sais whose authority was recognised at Memphisand Iuput II of Leontopolis.

Perhaps the biblical Pharaoh So 2 Kings 174. TwentyThird Dynasty The socalled TwentyThird Dynasty was an offshoot of this dynasty perhaps based in Upper Egypt though there is much debate concerning this issue. All of its kings reigned in Middle and Upper Egypt including the Western Desert Oases.
