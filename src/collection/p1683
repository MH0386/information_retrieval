25 th Dynasty or Dynasty 25 also known as the Nubian Dynasty the Kushite Empire the Black Pharaohs23 or the Napatans after their capital Napata4 was the last dynasty of the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt that occurred after the Nubian invasion. The 
25 th dynasty was a line of pharaohs who originated in the Kingdom of Kush located in presentday northern Sudan and Upper Egypt. Most of this dynastys kings saw Napata as their spiritual homeland. They reigned in part or all of Ancient Egypt for nearly a century from 744 to 656 BC.5678 The 
25 th dynasty was highly Egyptianized using the Egyptian language and writing system as their medium of record and exhibiting an unusual devotion to Egypts religious artistic and literary traditions. Earlier scholars have ascribed the origins of the dynasty to immigrants from Egypt particularly the Egyptian Amun priests.91011 The third intermediateperiod Egyptian stimulus view is still maintained by prominent scholars especially that excavations from elKurru cemetery the key site to the origin of the Napata state show sudden Egyptian arrivals and influence during the 
3 rd intermediate period concurrent with the Egyptianization process.1213 The 
25 th Dynastys reunification of Lower Egypt Upper Egypt and Kush created the largest Egyptian empire since the New Kingdom. They assimilated into society by reaffirming Ancient Egyptian religious traditions temples and artistic forms while introducing some unique aspects of Kushite culture.14 It was during the 
25 th dynasty that the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids many in what is now Northern Sudan since the Middle Kingdom.151617 After Sargon II and Sennacherib defeated attempts by the Nubian kings to gain a foothold in the Near East their successors Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal invaded defeated and drove out the Nubians in the Assyrian conquest of Egypt. The fall of the 
25 th Dynasty marks the start of the Late Period of ancient Egypt. The Twentysixth Dynasty was initially a puppet dynasty installed by and vassals of the Assyrians and was the last native dynasty to rule Egypt before the invasion by the Persian Achaemenid Empire. The traditional representation of the dynasty as Black Pharaohs has attracted criticism from scholars specifically because the term suggests that other dynasties did not share similar southern origins.18 They also argue that the term overlooks the genetic continuum that linked ancient Nubians and Egyptians.1920 Historyedit Piyeedit Main article Piye The twentyfifth dynasty originated in Kush which is presently in Northern Sudan. The citystate of Napata was the spiritual capital and it was from there that Piye spelled Piankhi or Piankhy in older works invaded and took control of Egypt.21 Piye personally led the attack on Egypt and recorded his victory in a lengthy hieroglyphic filled stele called the Stele of Victory. The stele announces Piye as Pharaoh of all Egypt and highlights his divine kingship by naming him Son of Re Ruler of Lower Egypt and Beloved of Amun Ruler of Upper Egypt.7166 Piyes success in achieving the double kingship after generations of Kushite planning resulted from Kushite ambition political skill and the Theban decision to reunify Egypt in this particular way and not Egypts utter exhaustion as frequently suggested in Egyptological studies.16 Piye revived one of the greatest features of the Old and Middle Kingdoms pyramid construction. An energetic builder he constructed the oldest known pyramid at the royal burial site of ElKurru. He also expanded the Temple of Amun at Jebel Barkal16 by adding an immense colonnaded forecourt.7163164 The Stele of Piye with detail of pharaoh Piye left partially erased.2223 Piye made various unsuccessful attempts to extend Egyptian influence in the Near East then controlled from Mesopotamia by the Semitic NeoAssyrian Empire. In 720 BC he sent an army in support of a rebellion against Assyria in Philistia and Gaza however Piye was defeated by Sargon II and the rebellion failed.24 Although Manetho does not mention the first king Piye mainstream Egyptologists consider him the first Pharaoh of the 
25 th dynasty.15161725 Manetho also does not mention the last king Tantamani although inscriptions exist to attest to the existence of both Piye and Tantamani. The Stele of Piye inscription describes Piye as very religious compassionate and a lover of horses.26 Piye scolded those that abused horses demanded horses as gifts and had eight of his horses buried with him.26 Studies of horse skeletons at el Kurru textual evidence and iconographical evidence related to the use of horses in Kushite warfare indicate that the finest horses used in Egypt and Assyria were bred in and exported from Nubia.7157158 Better horses chariots and the development of cavalry tactics helped Piye to defeat Tefnakht and his allies.7158 Shabaka and Shebitku Chronology Disputeedit Cartouche with the name of pharaoh Shabaka Although the Manethonic and classical traditions maintain that it was Shabakas invasion which brought Egypt under Kushite rule the most recent archaeological evidence shows that Shabaka ruled Egypt after Shebitku and not before as previously thought. The confusion may stem from Shabakas accession via Kushite collateral succession versus Egyptian patrilinear succession.7168 The construction of the tomb of Shebitku Ku. 18 resembles that of Piye Ku. 17 while that of Shabaka Ku. 15 is similar to that of Taharqa Nu. 1 and Tantamani Ku. 16 39  D.

The succession Shepenupet I  Amenirdis I thus took place during the reign of ShebitkuShabataqo. This detail in itself is sufficient to show that the reign of Shabaka cannot precede that of ShebitkuShabataqo.27 Finally Gerard Broekmans GM 251 2017 paper shows that Shebitku reigned before Shabaka since the upper edge of Shabakas NLR 
30 s Year 2 Karnak quay inscription was carved over the lefthand side of the lower edge of Shebitkus NLR33 Year 3 inscription.28 This can only mean that Shabaka ruled after Shebitku. Shebitkuedit Shebitku Nubian Museum According to the newer chronology Shebitku conquered the entire Nile Valley including Upper and Lower Egypt around 712 BC. Shebitku had Bocchoris of the preceding Sais dynasty burned to death for resisting him. After conquering Lower Egypt Shebitku transferred the capital to Memphis.28 Danel Kahn suggested that Shebitku was king of Egypt by 707706 BC.29 This is based on evidence from an inscription of the Assyrian king Sargon II which was found in Persia then a colony of Assyria and dated to 706 BC. This inscription calls Shebitku the king of Meluhha and states that he sent back to Assyria a rebel named Iamani in handcuffs. Kahns arguments have been widely accepted by many Egyptologists including Rolf Krauss and Aidan Dodson30 and other scholars at the SCIEM 2000 Synchronisation of Civilisations of the Eastern Mediterranean in the Second Millennium B.C. project with the notable exception of Kenneth Kitchen and Manfred Bietak at present. Shabakaedit Shabaka According to the traditional chronology Shabaka brought the entire Nile Valley as far as the Delta under the empire of Kush and is reputed to have had Bocchoris dynast of Sais burnt to death.157166167 There is no direct evidence that Shabaqo did slay Bakenranef and although earlier scholarship generally accepted the tradition it has recently been treated more skeptically.31 Initially Shabaka maintained good relations with Assyria as shown by his extradition of the rebel Iamani of Ashdod to Assyria in 712 BC.7167 Shabaka supported an uprising against the Assyrians in the Philistine city of Ashdod however he and his allies were defeated by Sargon II.citation needed Shabaka transferred the capital to Memphis7166 and restored the great Egyptian monuments and temples unlike his Libyan predecessors.7167169 Shabaka ushered in the age of Egyptian archaism or a return to a historical past which was embodied by a concentrated effort at religious renewal and restoration of Egypts holy places.7169 Shabaka also returned Egypt to a theocratic monarchy by becoming the first priest of Amon. In addition Shabaka is known for creating a wellpreserved example of Memphite theology by inscribing an old religious papyrus into the Shabaka Stone. Taharqaedit Main article Taharqa See also Assyrian conquest of Egypt Pharaoh Taharqa wearing the doubleuraeus skullcap.33 Portrait of Taharqa Nubian Museum.32 Assyrian siege of an Egyptian fort probably a scene from the war in 667 BC. Sculpted in 645  635 BC under Ashurbanipal at the Palace of Nineveh. British Museum.34 In 690 BC7 Taharqa was crowned in Memphis26 and ruled Upper and Lower Egypt as Pharaoh from Tanis in the Delta.3515 Taharqas reign was a prosperous time in the empire with a particularly large Nile river flood and abundant crops and wine.367 Taharqas inscriptions indicate that he gave large amounts of gold to the temple of Amun at Kawa.37 He restored and constructed great works throughout the Nile Valley including works at Jebel Barkal Kawa with Lebanese cedar7 Qasr Ibrim and Karnak.3839 Thebes was enriched on a monumental scale.7 At Karnak the Sacred Lake structures the kiosk in the first court and the colonnades at the temple entrance are all owed to Taharqa and Mentuemhet. Taharqa and the Kushites marked a renaissance in Pharaonic art.40 Taharqa built the largest pyramid 52 square meters at base in the Nubian region at Nuri near ElKurru with the most elaborate Kushite rockcut tomb.41 Taharqa was buried with over 1070 shabtis of varying sizes and made of granite green ankerite and alabaster.42 Taharqas army undertook successful military campaigns as attested by the list of conquered Asiatic principalities from the Mut temple at Karnak and conquered peoples and countries Libyans Shasu nomads Phoenicians Khor in Palestine from Sanam temple inscriptions.7 Imperial ambitions of the Mesopotamian based Assyrian Empire made war with the 
25 th dynasty inevitable. In 701 BC Taharqa and his army aided Judah and King Hezekiah in withstanding a siege by King Sennacherib of the Assyrians 2 Kings 199 Isaiah 3
79.4 3 There are various theories Taharqas army44 disease divine intervention Hezekiahs surrender as to why the Assyrians failed to take the city and withdrew to Assyria.45 Torok mentions that Egypts army was beaten at Eltekeh under Taharqas command but the battle could be interpreted as a victory for the double kingdom since Assyria did not take Jerusalem and retreated to Assyria.7170 Many historians claim that Sennacherib was the overlord of Khor following the siege in 701 BC. Sennacheribs annals record Judah was forced into tribute after the siege.24 However this is contradicted by Khors frequent utilization of an Egyptian system of weights for trade46 the 20 year cessation in Assyrias pattern before 701 and after Sennacheribs death of repeatedly invading Khor47 Khor paying tribute to Amun of Karnak in the first half of Taharqas reign7 and Taharqa flouting Assyrias ban on Lebanese cedar exports to Egypt while Taharqa was building his temple to Amun at Kawa.48 Sennacherib was murdered by his own sons in revenge for the destruction of the rebellious Mesopotamian city of Babylon a city sacred to all Mesopotamians the Assyrians included.citation needed In 679 BC Sennacheribs successor King Esarhaddon campaigned into Khor and took a town loyal to Egypt. After destroying Sidon and forcing Tyre into tribute in 677676 BC Esarhaddon invaded Egypt in 674 BC. Taharqa and his army defeated the Assyrians outright in 674 BC according to Babylonian records.49 Taharqas Egypt still held sway in Khor during this period as evidenced by Esarhaddons 671 BC annal mentioning that Tyres King Balu had put his trust upon his friend Taharqa Ashkelons alliance with Egypt and Esarhaddons inscription asking if the Egyptian forces will defeat Esarhaddon at Ashkelon.50 However Taharqa was defeated in Egypt in 671 BC when Esarhaddon conquered Northern Egypt captured Memphis imposed tribute and then withdrew.35 In 669 BC Taharqa reoccupied Memphis as well as the Delta and recommenced intrigues with the king of Tyre.35 Esarhaddon again led his army to Egypt and on his death the command passed to Ashurbanipal. Ashurbanipal and the Assyrians advanced as far south as Thebes but direct Assyrian control was not established.35 Taharqa retreated to Nubia where he died in 664 BC. Taharqa remains an important historical figure in Sudan and elsewhere as is evidenced by Will Smiths recent project to depict Taharqa in a major motion picture.51 As of 2017 the status of this project is unknown. A study of the sphinx that was created to represent Taharqa indicates that he was a Kushite pharaoh from Nubia.52 Tantamaniedit Main article Tantamani Statue of Kushite ruler and last pharaoh of the 
25 th Dynasty of Egypt Tantamani Louvre Museum reconstruction. Taharqas successor Tantamani sailed north from Napata through Elephantine and with a large army to Thebes where he was ritually installed as the king of Egypt.7185 From Thebes Tantamani began his reconquest7185 and regained control of Egypt as far north as Memphis.35 Tantamanis dream stele states that he restored order from the chaos where royal temples and cults were not being maintained.7185 After defeating Sais and killing Assyrias vassal Necho I in Memphis some local dynasts formally surrendered while others withdrew to their fortresses.7185 Tantamani proceeded north of Memphis invading Lower Egypt and besieged cities in the Delta a number of which surrendered to him.citation needed Portrait of Tantamani from his tomb in ElKurru Nechos son Psamtik I fled Egypt to Assyria and returned in 664 BC with Ashurbanipal and a large army comprising Carian mercenaries.citation needed Upon the Assyrians arrival in Egypt Tantamani fled to Thebes where he was pursued by the Assyrians.7186187 Then Tantamani escaped to Nubia and the Assyrian army sacked Thebes and devastated the area in 663 BC35 Psamtik I was placed on the throne of Lower Egypt as a vassal of Ashurbanipal.citation needed Psamtik quickly unified Lower Egypt and expelled the Assyrian army becoming the first ruler of the TwentySixth Dynasty.7186 In 656 BC Psamtik sent a large fleet southwards to Thebes peacefully taking control of the still rebellious Upper Egypt thereby unifying all of Egypt. Tantamani and the Nubians never again posed a threat to either Assyria or Egypt. Upon his death Tantamani was buried in the royal cemetery of ElKurru upstream from the Kushite capital of Napata. He was succeeded by a son of Taharqa king Atlanersa.24 In total the Twentyfifth Dynasty ruled Egypt for less than one hundred years.553 The successors of the Twentyfifth Dynasty settled back in their Nubian homeland where they continued their kingdom at Napata 656590 BC and continued to make empty claims to Egyptian kingship during the next 60 years while the effective control of Egypt was in the hands of Psamtik I and his successors.54 The Kushite next ruled further south at Mero 590 BC

25 th dynasty are represented in a few Assyrian reliefs related to the Assyrian conquest of Egypt such as the Siege of an Egyptian fort in 667 BC. Nubian soldiers defending their city are represented as well as prisoners under Assyrian escort many wearing the typical onefeathered headgear of Taharqas soldiers.5556 Armoured Kushite soldiers of Taharqa defending their city from the Assyrian assault Nubian prisoners escorted by Assyrian guards out of the Egyptian city.55 Nubian prisoners.They wear the typical onefeathered headgear of Taharqas soldiers.55 Revenge of Psamtik IIedit Psamtik II the third ruler of the following dynasty the TwentySixth Dynasty deliberately destroyed monuments belonging to the 
25 th Dynasty of Kushite kings in Egypt erasing their names and their emblems of royalty from statues and reliefs in Egypt. He then sent an army to Nubia in 592 BCE to erase all traces of their rule during the reign of the Kushite King Aspelta. This expedition and its destructions are recorded on several victory stelae especially the Victory Stela of Kalabsha. The Egyptian army may have gone on to sack Napata although there is no good evidence to indicate that they actually did so.3565 This led to the transfer of the Kushite capital farther south at Mero.5758 Art and architectureedit Main articles Art of Ancient Egypt and Nubian pyramids The royal pyramids of Nuri Temple of Amun at Jebel Barkal originally built during the Egyptian New Kingdom but greatly enhanced by Piye. Although the TwentyFifth Dynasty controlled Ancient Egypt for only 91 years 747656 BC it holds an important place in Egyptian history due to the restoration of traditional Egyptian values culture art and architecture. The Twentyfifth Dynasty of Egypt revived the lost Egyptian tradition of building pyramids for their deceased rulers. Nubian kings built their own pyramids 1000 years after Egyptian burial methods had changed.59 Nubian pyramids were built for the first time at El Kurru in 751 BC for the Piye the first ruler of the 
25 th Dynasty and more were built at Nuri.60 The Nubianstyle pyramids emulated a form of Egyptian private elite family pyramid that was common during the New Kingdom 15501069 BC.61 There are twice as many Nubian pyramids still standing today as there are Egyptian.59 The pyramid of Piye founder of the

The period starting with Kashta and ending with Malonaqen is sometimes called the Napatan Period. The later Kings from the twentyfifth dynasty ruled over Napata Meroe and Egypt. The seat of government and the royal palace were in Napata during this period while Meroe was a provincial city. The kings and queens were buried in ElKurru and Nuri.63 Alara the first known Nubian king and predecessor of Kashta was not a 
25 th dynasty king since he did not control any region of Egypt during his reign. While Piye is viewed as the founder of the 
25 th dynasty some publications may include Kashta who already controlled some parts of Upper Egypt. A stela of his was found at Elephantine and Kashta likely exercised some influence at Thebes although he did not control it since he held enough sway to have his daughter Amenirdis I adopted as the next Divine Adoratrice of Amun there.

Smith who has been excavating the ancient site of Tombos in modern Sudan Nubia since 2000 has focused his research on questions of identity especially ethnicity and intercultural interaction between ancient Egypt and Nubia. In the 
8 th century BCE he noted Kushite rulers were crowned as Kings of Egypt ruling a combined Nubian and Egyptian kingdom as pharaohs of Egypts 
25 th Dynasty. Those Kushite kings are commonly referred to as the Black Pharaohs in both scholarly and popular publications. That terminology Smith said is often presented as a celebration of black African civilization. But it also reflects a longstanding bias that holds the Egyptian pharaohs and their people werent African  that is not Black. Its a trope that feeds into a long history of racism that traces back to the some of the founding figures of Egyptology and their role in the creation of scientific racism in the U.S. ... It has always struck me as odd that Egyptologists have been reluctant to admit that the ancient and modern Egyptians were rather darkskinned Africans especially the farther south one goes Smith continued.  One of the other problems with the Black Pharaohs monikor is that it implies that none of the other Predynastic Protodynastic or dynastic Egyptian rulers could be called black  in the sense of the Kushites  which while not particularly interesting is not true. Even Sir Flinders Petrie father of the Asiatic Dynastic Race theory of dynastic Egypts foundation stated that various other dynasties were of Sudany origin or had connections there based on phenotype which implies incorrectly that particular traits could not have been Egyptian i.e. been a part of its ancestral biological variation.
