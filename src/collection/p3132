Historyedit Dynastic Egyptedit See also Ancient Egypt The nomes  towns of Egypt in hieroglyphics The division of ancient Egypt into nomes can be traced back to prehistoric Egypt before 3100 BC. These nomes originally existed as autonomous citystatescitation needed but later began to unify. According to ancient tradition the ruler Menes completed the final unification.7 Not only did the division into nomes remain in place for more than three millennia the areas of the individual nomes and their ordering remained remarkably stable. Some like Xois in the Nile Delta or Khent in Upper Egypt were first mentioned on the Palermo Stone which was inscribed in the Fifth Dynasty. The names of a few like the nome of Bubastis appeared no earlier than the New Kingdom. Under the system that prevailed for most of pharaonic Egypts history the country was divided into 42 nomes. Lower Egypt nomesedit Lower Egypt nomes Lower Egypt Egyptian mety from the Old Kingdom capital Memphis to the Mediterranean Sea comprised 20 nomes. The first was based around Memphis Saqqara and Giza in the area occupied by modernday Cairo. The nomes were numbered in a more or less orderly fashion south to north through the Nile Delta first covering the territory on the west before continuing with the higher numbers to the east. Thus Alexandria was in the Third Nome Bubastis was in the Eighteenth.

The first of these was centered on Elephantine close to Egypts border with Nubia at the First Cataract  the area of modernday Aswan. From there the numbering progressed downriver in an orderly fashion along the narrow fertile strip of land that was the Nile valley. Waset ancient Thebes or contemporary Luxor was in the Fourth Nome Amarna in the Fourteenth and Meidum in the Twentyfirst.

Hadrian created a new nome Antinoopolites for which Antinopolis was the capital. Roman Egyptedit See also Egypt Roman province The nomes survived into Roman times. Under Roman rule individual nomes minted their own coinage the socalled nome coins which still reflect individual local associations and traditions. The nomes of Egypt retained their primary importance as administrative units until the fundamental rearrangement of the bureaucracy during the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine the Great. From AD 3078 their place was taken by smaller units called pagi. Eventually powerful local officials arose who were called pagarchs through whom all patronage flowed. The pagarchs essential role was as an organizer of taxcollection. Later the pagarch assumed some military functions as well. The pagarchs were often wealthy landowners who reigned over the pagi from which they originated. Nomarchedit Wooden figures found in the tomb of

11 th Dynasty For most of the history each nome was headed by a nomarch. The position of the nomarch was at times hereditary while at others they were appointed by the pharaoh. Generally when the national government was stronger nomarchs were the kings appointed governors. When the central government was weaker howeversuch as during foreign invasions or civil warsindividual nomes would assert themselves and establish hereditary lines of succession.4 Conflicts among these different hereditary nomarchies were common most notably during the First Intermediate Period a time that saw a breakdown in central authority lasting from the
