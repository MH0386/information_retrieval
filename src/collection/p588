He is known for his destroyed statuette. He is also the subject of a theory that claims he was pharaoh of Egypt for a very short time. Thus he might be identical to a scarcely known king named Bikheris.1 Identityedit Baka was a prince and son of pharaoh Djedefre. He lived and worked during the 
4 th Dynasty. His family life is unknown and the names of his wives and children are lost. Since the names of three other sons of Djedefre namely Setka Harnit and NykauDjedefre are archaeologically attested these should be Bakas brothers or halfbrothers. The daughters of Djedefre Hetepheres III and Neferhetepes would be Bakas sisters or halfsisters. His mother is unknown too. She could be one of Djedefres wives Khentetka or Hetepheres II but this is highly uncertain.23 Possible reign as pharaohedit According to Rainer Stadelmann and George Reisner it is possible that Baka was pharaoh in Egypt for a very short time maybe one or two years. Their assumption is based on the socalled Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet elAryan which is located at Zawyet elAryan. This unfinished pyramid shaft was abandoned shortly after being started and only a dozen of workmens inscriptions in black ink were found. These provide a royal cartouche name which remains partially illegible. The first sign can be identified as a Kasign but the first and former sign was copied by the pyramid excavator so fuzzily that it remains undecipherable. According to Stadelmann and Reisner the first sign shows a walking ram as it does in the birth name of the prince. Baka simply put his citizen name into a royal cartouche due to his lifetime but then the name was changed after his death into Bakar soul and Ka of R. In ancient Greek chronics Bakas name was hellenized into Bikheris. For this reason the unfinished tomb shaft at Zawyet elAryan is also called the Pyramid of Bikheris.4 This theory is not commonly accepted though. Aidan Dodson is convinced of the depiction of a sitting Sethanimal reading the royal name as SethKa Seth is mine Ka. In this case Setka had actually followed his father onto the throne.3 Referencesedit  Thomas Schneider Lexikon der Pharaonen.
