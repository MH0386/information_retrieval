The medicine of the ancient Egyptians is some of the oldest documented. From the beginnings of the civilization in the late fourth millennium BC until the Persian invasion of 525 BC Egyptian medical practice went largely unchanged and included simple noninvasive surgery setting of bones dentistry and an extensive set of pharmacopoeia. Egyptian medical thought influenced later traditions including the Greeks. Sources of informationedit Main article Egyptian medical papyri Ebers Papyrus treatment for cancer recounting a tumor against the god Xenus it recommends do thou nothing there against Until the 
19 th century the main sources of information about ancient Egyptian medicine were writings from later in antiquity. The Greek historian Herodotus visited Egypt around 440 BC and wrote extensively of his observations of their medicinal practice.1 Pliny the Elder also wrote favorably of them in historical review. Hippocrates the father of medicine Herophilos Erasistratus and later Galen studied at the temple of Amenhotep and acknowledged the contribution of ancient Egyptian medicine to Greek medicine.2 In 1822 the translation of the Rosetta stone finally allowed the translation of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions and papyri including many related to medical matters Egyptian medical papyri. The resultant interest in Egyptology in the 
19 th century led to the discovery of several sets of extensive ancient medical documents including the Ebers papyrus the Edwin Smith Papyrus the Hearst Papyrus the London Medical Papyrus and others dating back as far as 2900 BC. The Edwin Smith Papyrus is a textbook on surgery and details anatomical observations and the examination diagnosis treatment and prognosis of numerous ailments.3 It was probably written around 1600 BC but is regarded as a copy of several earlier texts. Medical information in it dates from as early as 3000 BC.4 It is thus viewed as a learning manual. Treatments consisted of ointments made from animal vegetable or fruit substances or minerals.5 There is evidence of oral surgery being performed as early as the 
4 th Dynasty 29002750 BC.6 The Ebers papyrus c. 1550 BC includes 877 prescriptions  as categorized by a modern editor  for a variety of ailments and illnesses some of them involving magical remedies for Egyptian beliefs regarding magic and medicine were often intertwined.7 It also contains documentation revealing awareness of tumors along with instructions on tumor removal.7 The Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus8 treats womens complaints including problems with conception. Thirty four cases detailing diagnosis and9 treatment survive some of them fragmentarily.10 Dating to 1800 BC it is the oldest surviving medical text of any kind. Other documents such as the Hearst papyrus 1450 BC and Berlin Papyrus 1200 BC also provide valuable insight into ancient Egyptian medicine. Other information comes from the images that often adorn the walls of Egyptian tombs and the translation of the accompanying inscriptions. Advances in modern medical technology also contributed to the understanding of ancient Egyptian medicine. Paleopathologists were able to use Xrays and later CAT Scans to view the bones and organs of mummies. Electron microscopes mass spectrometry and various forensic techniques allowed scientists unique glimpses of the state of health in Egypt 4000 years ago. Nutritionedit The ancient Egyptians were at least partially aware of the importance of diet both in balance and moderation.11 Owing to Egypts great endowment of fertile land food production was never a major issue although no matter how bountiful the land paupers and starvation still exist. The main crops for most of ancient Egyptian history were emmer wheat and barley. Consumed in the form of loaves which were produced in a variety of types through baking and fermentation with yeast greatly enriching the nutritional value of the product one farmers crop could support an estimated twenty adults. Barley was also used in beer. Vegetables and fruits of many types were widely grown. Oil was produced from the linseed plant and there was a limited selection of spices and herbs. Meat sheep goats pigs wild game was regularly available to at least the upper classes and fish were widely consumed although there is evidence of prohibitions during certain periods against certain types of animal products Herodotus wrote of the pig as being unclean. Offerings to King Unas c. 24942345 BC were recorded as ...milk three kinds of beer five kinds of wine ten loaves four of bread ten of cakes four meats different cuts joints roast spleen limb breast quail goose pigeon figs ten other fruits three kinds of corn barley spelt five kinds of oil and fresh plants... It is clear that the Egyptian diet was not lacking for the upper classes and that even the lower classes may have had some selection Nunn 2002. Pharmacologyedit Like many civilizations in the past the ancient Egyptians amply discovered the medicinal properties of plant life around them. The Edwin Smith Papyrus contains many recipes to help heal different ailments. One short section of the papyrus lays out five recipes one dealing with problems women may have had three on techniques for refining the complexion and the fifth recipe for ailments of the colon.12 The ancient Egyptians were known to use honey as medicine and the juices of pomegranates served as both an astringent and a delicacy.13 In the Ebers Papyrus there are over 800 remedies some were topicallike ointments and wrappings others were oral medication such as pills and mouth rinses still others were taken through inhalation.1415 The recipes to cure constipation consisted of berries from the castor oil tree Male Palm and Gengent beans just to name a few. One recipe that was to help headaches called for innerofonion fruitoftheamtree natron setseftseeds boneoftheswordfish cooked redfish cooked skullofcrayfish cooked honey and abraointment.1444 and 60 Some of the recommended treatments made use of cannabis and incense.15156 and 158 Egyptian medicinal use of plants in antiquity is known to be extensive with some 160 distinct plant products...16 Amidst the many plant extracts and fruits the Egyptians also used animal feces and even some metals as treatments.17 These prescriptions of antiquity were measured out by volume not weight which makes their prescriptionmaking craft more like cooking than what pharmacists do today.15140 While their treatments and herbal remedies seem almost boundless they still included incantations along with some therapeutic remedies.12472 Egyptian drug therapy is considered ineffective by todays standards according to Michael D. Parkins who says that 28 of 260 medical prescriptions in the Hearst Papyrus had ingredients which can be perceived to have had activity towards the condition being treated and another third supplied to any given disorder would produce a purgative effect on the gastrointestinal system.18 Practicesedit Ancient Egyptian medical instruments depicted in a Ptolemaic period inscription on the Temple of Kom Ombo. Egyptians had some knowledge of human anatomy. For example in the classic mummification process mummifiers knew how to insert a long hooked implement through a nostril breaking the thin bone of the braincase and removing the brain but more commonly created a hole in the back of the head so that the brain and other fluids could drain from the foramen magnum.19 They also had a general idea that inner organs are in the body cavity. They removed the organs through a small incision in the left groin. Whether this knowledge was passed down to the practitioners is unknown yet it did not seem to have had any impact on their medical theories. Egyptian physicians were aware of the existence of the pulse and its connection to the heart. The author of the Smith Papyrus even had a vague idea of the cardiac system. However he did not know about blood circulation and deemed it unimportant to distinguish between blood vessels tendons and nerves. They developed their theory of channels that carried air water and blood to the body by analogies with the River Nile if it became blocked crops became unhealthy. They applied this principle to the body If a person was unwell they would use laxatives to unblock the channels.
20 unreliable source The oldest written text mentioning enemas is the Ebers Papyrus and many medications were administered using enemas. One of the many types of medical specialists was an Iri the Shepherd of the Anus.21 Many of their medical practices were effective such as the surgical procedures given in the Edwin Smith papyrus. Mostly the physicians advice for staying healthy was to wash and shave the body including under the arms to prevent infections. They also advised patients to look after their diet and avoid foods such as raw fish or other animals considered to be unclean.22 Surgeryedit The oldest metal Bronze23 or copper24 25 surgical tools26 in the world were discovered in the tomb of Qar. Surgery was a common practice among physicians as treatment for physical injuries. The Egyptian physicians recognized three categories of injuries treatable contestable and untreatable ailments. Treatable ailments the surgeons would quickly set to right. Contestable ailments were those where the victim could presumably survive without treatment so patients assumed to be in this category were observed and if they survived then surgical attempts could be made to fix the problem with them. They used knives hooks drills forceps pincers scales spoons saws and a vase with burning incense.27 Circumcision of males was the normal practice as stated by Herodotus in his Histories.
28 clarification needed Though its performance as a procedure was rarely mentioned the uncircumcised nature of other cultures was frequently noted the uncircumcised nature of the Libyans was frequently referenced and military campaigns brought back uncircumcised phalli as trophies which suggests novelty. However other records describe initiates into the religious orders as involving circumcision which would imply that the practice was special and not widespread. The only known depiction of the procedure in The Tomb of the Physician burial place of AnkhMahor at Saqqara shows adolescents or adults not babies. Female circumcision may have been practiced although the single reference to it in ancient texts may be a mistranslation.11 Prosthetics such as artificial toes and eyeballs were also used typically they served little more than decorative purposes. In preparation for burial missing body parts would be replaced however these do not appear as if they would have been useful or even attachable before death.11 The extensive use of surgery mummification practices and autopsy as a religious exercise gave Egyptians a vast knowledge of the bodys morphology and even a considerable understanding of organ functions. The function of most major organs was correctly presumedfor example blood was correctly guessed to be a transpiration medium for vitality and waste which is not too far from its actual role in carrying oxygen and removing carbon dioxidewith the exception of the heart and brain whose functions were switched. Dentistryedit Dentistry was an important field as an independent profession it dated from the early 
3 rd millennium BC although it may never have been prominent. The Egyptian diet was high in abrasives from sand left over from grinding grain and bits of rocks in which the way bread was prepared and so the condition of their teeth was poor. Archaeologists have noted a steady decrease in severity and incidence of worn teeth throughout 4000 BC to 1000 AD probably due to improved grain grinding techniques.15 All Egyptian remains have sets of teeth in quite poor states. Dental disease could even be fatal such as for Djedmaatesankh a musician from Thebes who died around the age of thirty five from extensive dental disease and a large infected cyst. If an individuals teeth escaped being worn down cavities were rare due to the rarity of sweeteners. Dental treatment was ineffective and the best sufferers could hope for was the quick loss of an infected tooth. The Instruction of Ankhsheshonq contains the maxim There is no tooth that rots yet stays in place.11 No records document the hastening of this process and no tools suited for the extraction of teeth have been found though some remains show sign of forced tooth removal.15 Replacement teeth have been found although it is not clear whether they are just postmortem cosmetics. Extreme pain might have been medicated with opium.11 Doctors and other healersedit This wood and leather prosthetic toe was used by an amputee to facilitate walking The ancient Egyptian word for doctor is swnw. This title has a long history. The earliest recorded physician in the worldcitation needed HesyRa practiced in ancient Egypt. He was Chief of Dentists and Physicians to King Djoser who ruled in the 
27 th century BC.29 The lady Peseshet 2400 BC may be the first recorded female doctor she was possibly the mother of Akhethotep and on a stela dedicated to her in his tomb she is referred to as imyr swnwt which has been translated as Lady Overseer of the Lady Physicians swnwt is the feminine of swnw.citation needed There were many ranks and specializations in the field of medicine. Royalty employed their own swnw even their own specialists. There were inspectors of doctors overseers and chief doctors. Known ancient Egyptian specialists are ophthalmologist gastroenterologist proctologist dentist doctor who supervises butchers and an unspecified inspector of liquids. The ancient Egyptian term for proctologist neru phuyt literally translates as shepherd of the anus. The latter title is already attested around 2200 BC by Irynachet. Institutions called Per Ankh30 or Houses of Life are known to have been established in ancient Egypt since the 
1 st Dynasty and may have had medical functions being at times associated in inscriptions with physicians such as Peftauawyneit and Wedjahorresnet living in the middle of the 
1 st millennium BC.31 By the time of the 
19 th Dynasty their employees enjoyed such benefits as medical insurance pensions and sick leave.29 Table of ancient Egyptian physiciansedit Physician Name Other names Kings service  Dating Titles Gender Medical practice Site Medical legacy Non medical legacy Burial site Imhotep Egyptian mtp jimtap meaning the one who comes in peace is with peace Immutef Imhotep or IiemHotep called Imuthes  Djoser circa 26502600 BC Chancellor of the King of Egypt Doctor First in line after the King of Upper Egypt Administrator of the Great Palace Hereditary nobleman High Priest of Heliopolis Builder Chief Carpenter Chief Sculptor and Maker of Vases in Chief.
