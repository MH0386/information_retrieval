In its narrowest sense which is in use today in archaeology and other cultural contexts it is equivalent to Cyprus and a stretch of land bordering the Mediterranean Sea in western Asia45 i.e. the historical region of Syria Greater Syria which includes presentday Israel Jordan Lebanon Syria the Palestinian territories and most of Turkey southwest of the middle Euphrates. Its overwhelming characteristic is that it represents the land bridge between Africa and Eurasia.5 In its widest historical sense the Levant included all of the Eastern Mediterranean with its islands6 that is it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores extending from Greece in Southern Europe to Cyrenaica Eastern Libya in Northern Africa.327 In the 
13 th and 
14 th centuries the term levante was used for Italian maritime commerce in the Eastern Mediterranean including Greece Anatolia SyriaPalestine and Egypt that is the lands east of Venice.3 Eventually the term was restricted to the Muslim countries of SyriaPalestine and Egypt.3 The term entered English in the late 
15 th century from French.6 It derives from the Italian levante meaning rising implying the rising of the Sun in the east32 and is broadly equivalent to the term alMashriq Arabic  al.ma.riq8 meaning the eastern place where the Sun rises.9 In 1581 England set up the Levant Company to trade with the Ottoman Empire.3 The name Levant States was used to refer to the French mandate over Syria and Lebanon after World War I.32 This is probably the reason why the term Levant has come to be used more specifically to refer to modern Syria Lebanon Palestine Israel Jordan and Cyprus.3 Some scholars mistakenly believed that it derives from the name of Lebanon.3 Today the term is often used in conjunction with prehistoric or ancient historical references. It has the same meaning as SyriaPalestine or AshShaam Arabic  a.am the area that is bounded by the Taurus Mountains of Turkey in the north the Mediterranean Sea in the west the north Arabian Desert and Mesopotamia in the east and Sinai in the south which can be fully included or not.105 Typically it does not include Anatolia also called Asia Minor the Caucasus Mountains or any part of the Arabian Peninsula proper. Cilicia in Asia Minor and the Sinai Peninsula Asian Egypt are sometimes included. As a name for the contemporary region several dictionaries consider Levant to be archaic today.111213 Both the noun Levant and the adjective Levantine are now commonly used to describe the ancient and modern culture area formerly called SyroPalestinian or Biblical archaeologists now speak of the Levant and of Levantine archaeology141516 food scholars speak of Levantine cuisine4 and the Latin Christians of the Levant continue to be called Levantine Christians.17 The Levant has been described as the crossroads of Western Asia the Eastern Mediterranean and Northeast Africa18 and in geological tectonic terms as the northwest of the Arabian Plate.19 The populations of the Levant2021 share not only the geographic position but cuisine some customs and history. They are often referred to as Levantines.22 Etymology See also Names of the Levant French medal commemorating the FrancoTurkish War in Cilicia c.1920 The term Levant appears in English in 1497 and originally meant the East or Mediterranean lands east of Italy.23 It is borrowed from the French levant rising referring to the rising of the sun in the east23 or the point where the sun rises.24 The phrase is ultimately from the Latin word levare meaning lift raise. Similar etymologies are found in Greek  Anatol cf. Anatolia the direction of sunrise in Germanic Morgenland lit.morning land in Italian as in Riviera di Levante the portion of the Liguria coast east of Genoa in Hungarian Kelet east in Spanish and Catalan Levante and Llevant the place of rising and in Hebrew  mizra east. Most notably Orient and its Latin source oriens meaning east is literally rising deriving from Latin orior rise.25 The notion of the Levant has undergone a dynamic process of historical evolution in usage meaning and understanding. While the term Levantine originally referred to the European residents of the eastern Mediterranean region it later came to refer to regional native and minority groups.26 The term became current in English in the 
16 th century along with the first English merchant adventurers in the region English ships appeared in the Mediterranean in the 15
70 s and the English merchant company signed its agreement capitulations with the Ottoman Sultan in 15
79.2 7 The English Levant Company was founded in 1581 to trade with the Ottoman Empire and in 1670 the French Compagnie du Levant was founded for the same purpose. At this time the Far East was known as the Upper Levant.3 1909 postcard depicting Ottoman Constantinople and bearing a French stamp inscribed Levant In early 
19 thcentury travel writing the term sometimes incorporated certain Mediterranean provinces of the Ottoman Empire as well as independent Greece and especially the Greek islands. In 
19 thcentury archaeology it referred to overlapping cultures in this region during and after prehistoric times intending to reference the place instead of any one culture. The French mandate of Syria and Lebanon 19201946 was called the Levant states.32 Geography and modernday use of the term Satellite view of the Levant including Cyprus Syria Lebanon Israel Palestine Jordan and the Northern Sinai Egypt Today Levant is the term typically used by archaeologists and historians with reference to the history of the region. Scholars have adopted the term Levant to identify the region due to its being a wider yet relevant cultural corpus that does not have the political overtones of SyriaPalestine.bc The term is also used for modern events peoples states or parts of states in the same region28 namely Cyprus Egypt Iraq Israel Jordan Lebanon Palestine Syria and Turkey are sometimes considered Levant countries compare with Near East Middle East Eastern Mediterranean and West Asia. Several researchers include the island of Cyprus in Levantine studies including the Council for British Research in the Levant29 the UCLA Near Eastern Languages and Cultures department30 Journal of Levantine Studies31 and the UCL Institute of Archaeology18 the last of which has dated the connection between Cyprus and mainland Levant to the early Iron Age. Archaeologists seeking a neutral orientation that is neither biblical nor national have used terms such as Levantine archaeology and archaeology of the Southern Levant.3233 While the usage of the term Levant in academia has been restricted to the fields of archeology and literature there is a recent attempt to reclaim the notion of the Levant as a category of analysis in political and social sciences. Two academic journals were launched in the early 20
10 s using the word the Journal of Levantine Studies published by the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute34 and The Levantine Review published by Boston College.35 The word Levant has been used in some translations of the term ashShm as used by the organization known as ISIL ISIS and other names though there is disagreement as to whether this translation is accurate.36 In archaeology a definition In The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of the Levant c. 8000332 BCE OHAL 2013 the definition of the Levant for the specific purposes of the book is synonymous to that of the Arabic bilad alsham the land of sham Syria translating in Western parlance to greater Syria.10 OHAL defines the boundaries of the Levant as follows.105 To the north the Taurus Mountains10 or the Plain of Amuq5 To the east the eastern deserts i.e. from north to south the Euphrates and the Jebel elBishr area for the northern Levant followed by the Syrian Desert east of the eastern hinterland of the AntiLebanon range whose southernmost part is Mount Hermon and Transjordans highlands and eastern desert also discussed at Syrian Desert also known as the Badia region.5 In other words Mesopotamia and the North Arabian Desert.10 To the south Wadi alArish in Sinai5 To the west the Mediterranean Sea10 Subregions A distinction is made between the main subregions of the Levant the northern and the southern5 The Litani River marks the division between the Northern Levant and the Southern Levant.5 The island of Cyprus is also included as a third subregion in the archaeological region of the Levant5 Cyprus geographically distinct from the Levant is included due to its proximity and natural resources copper in particular which induced close cultural ties.5 History Further information Prehistory of the Levant and History of the ancient Levant See also History of the Middle East History of Palestine History of Israel and History of Lebanon Demographics See also Demographics of the Middle East Religious and ethnic groups Historical population of the Levant Year Pop.  14 4300000  164 4800000

7.2  Source37383940 The largest religious group in the Levant are Muslims most of whom identify as Arabs and speak Levantine Arabic a dialect of Arabic descended from Hejazi Arabic and preIslamic Arabic dialects of Syria with much influence from Western Middle Aramaic.41 According to recent ancient DNA studies Levantines derive most of their ancestry from ancient Semiticspeaking peoples of the Bronze and Iron age Levant.42 Other Arabs include the Bedouins of Syrian Desert Naqab and eastern Syria who speak Bedouin Arabic. NonArab minorities include Circassians Chechens Turks Jews Turkmens Assyrians Kurds Nawars and Armenians. The Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 
7 th century introduced Islam into the region43 but the bulk of the population in Syria and upper Mesopotamia remained Christian until the 
13 th century.44 The majority of Levantine Muslims are Sunnis adhering to the four madhhabs Hanafi Shafii Hanbali and Maliki. Islamic minorities include the Alawites and Nizari Ismailis in Syria and Twelver Shiites in Lebanon. Levantine Christian groups include Greek Orthodox Antiochian Greek Syriac Orthodox Eastern Catholic Syriac Catholic Melkite and Maronite Roman Catholic Latin Nestorian and Protestant. Armenians mostly belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. There are also Levantines or FrancoLevantines who adhere to Roman Catholicism. There are also Assyrians belonging to the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church.45 Other religious groups in the Levant include Jews Samaritans Yazidis and Druze.46 In addition this region has a number of sites that are of religious significance for Abrahamic religions such as Masjid AlAqsa47 the Church of the Holy Sepulchre48 the Western Wall in Jerusalem Sayyidah Zainab Mosque in Damascus and Antioch in Hatay. Languages Map representing the distribution of the Arabic dialects in the area of the Levant Most populations in the Levant speak Levantine Arabic  m usually classified as the varieties North Levantine Arabic in Lebanon Syria and parts of Turkey and South Levantine Arabic in Palestine and Jordan. Each of these encompasses a spectrum of regional or urbanrural variations. In addition to the varieties normally grouped together as Levantine a number of other varieties and dialects of Arabic are spoken in the Levant area such as Levantine Bedawi Arabic and Mesopotamian Arabic.49 Among the languages of Israel the official language is Hebrew Arabic was until July 19 2018 also an official language.50 The Arab minority in 2018 about 21 of the population of Israel50 speaks a dialect of Levantine Arabic essentially indistinguishable from the forms spoken in the Palestinian territories. Of the languages of Cyprus the two official languages are Turkish and Greek. The most used languages by population are Greek in the south followed by Turkish in the north. Two minority languages are recognized Armenian and Cypriot Maronite Arabic a hybrid of mostly medieval Arabic vernaculars with strong influence from contact with Turkish and Greek spoken by approximately 1000 people.51 Some communities and populations speak Aramaic Greek Armenian Circassian French Russian or English.citation needed See also Overlapping regional designations Fertile Crescent Mashriq Mesopotamia Middle East Near East West Asia Subregional designations Southern Levant Others French post offices in the Ottoman Empire Levant stamps History of the Levant Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Referred to in current events as ISIL or ISIS Levantine Sea Levantines Latin Christians Catholic Europeans in the Levant Other places in the east of a larger region Levante Spain Riviera di Levante Italy Explanatory notes  Total population by adding the populations of Cyprus Israel Jordan Lebanon Palestine Syria and Turkeys Hatay Province.  Nevertheless despite such a wellreasoned basis for the identification of Levantine archaeology the adoption of this term by many scholars has been for the most part simply the result of individual attempts to consider a wider yet relevant cultural corpus than that which is suggested by the use of terms like Canaan Israel or even SyriaPalestine. Regardless of the manner in which the term has come into common use for a couple of additional reasons it seems clear that the Levant will remain the term of choice. In the first place scholars have shown a penchant for the term Levant despite the fact that the term SyriaPalestine has been advocated since the late 19
70 s. This is evident from the fact that no journal or series today has adopted a title that includes SyriaPalestine. However the journal Levant has been published since 1969 and since 1990 gypten und Levante has also attracted a plethora of papers relating to the archaeology of this region. Furthermore a search through any electronic database of titles reveals an overwhelming adoption of the term Levant when compared to SyriaPalestine for archaeological studies. Undoubtedly this is mostly due to the fact that SyriaPalestine was a Roman administrative division of the Levant created by Hadrian Millar 1993. The term SyriaPalestine also carries political overtones that inadvertently evoke current efforts to establish a fullfledged Palestinian state. Scholars have recognized therefore thatfor at least the time beingthey can spare themselves further headaches by adopting the term Levant to identify this region Burke 20
10 page needed  At the beginning of this Introduction I have indicated how difficult it is to choose a general accepted name for the region this book deals with. In Europe we are used to the late Roman name Palestine and the designation Palestinian Archaeology has a long history. According to Byzantine usage it included CisJordan and TransJordan and even Lebanon and Sinai. In modern times however the name Palestine has exclusively become the political designation for a restricted area. Furthermore in the period this book deals with a region called Palestine did not yet exist. Also the ancient name Canaan cannot be used as it refers to an older period in history. Designations as The Lands of the Bible or the Holy Land evoke the suspicion of a theological bias. The Land of Israel does not apply to the situation because it never included Lebanon or the greater part of modern Jordan. Therefore I have joined those who today advocate the designation Southern Levant. Although I confess that it is an awkward name it is at least strictly geographical.

The Arabic spoken in Syria and Mesopotamia has replaced Aramaic dialects there and it can be assumed that a bilingual situation existed for a long time and that numerous Aramaic lexemes found their way into Arabic during this period. The presence of Aramaic lexemes is well studied in Lebanese Arabic Fghali 1918 Freyha 1973 and the dialects spoken in the AntiLebanon Arnold and Behnstedt 1993 but can be found in dictionaries from the entire SyroPalestinian area cf. Barbot 1961. The material collected by Fghali and Freyha shows that unlike in the arabiyya most borrowings preserve the Aramaic phonology The Aramaic vocabulary is likely to be the largest foreign element in the Arabic lexicon even if the exact extent is difficult to define.
