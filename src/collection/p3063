He was Caesar from 285 to 286 then Augustus from 286 to 3
05.1  He shared the latter title with his coemperor and superior Diocletian whose political brain complemented Maximians military brawn. Maximian established his residence at Trier but spent most of his time on campaign. In late 285 he suppressed rebels in Gaul known as the Bagaudae. From 285 to 288 he fought against Germanic tribes along the Rhine frontier. Together with Diocletian he launched a scorched earth campaign deep into Alamannic territory in 288 refortifying the frontier. The man he appointed to police the Channel shores Carausius rebelled in 286 causing the secession of Britain and northwestern Gaul. Maximian failed to oust Carausius and his invasion fleet was destroyed by storms in 289 or 290. Maximians subordinate Constantius campaigned against Carausius successor Allectus while Maximian held the Rhine frontier. The rebel leader was ousted in 296 and Maximian moved south to combat piracy near Hispania and Berber incursions in Mauretania. When these campaigns concluded in 298 he departed for Italy where he lived in comfort until 305. At Diocletians behest Maximian abdicated on 1 May 305 gave the Augustan office to Constantius and retired to southern Italy. In late 306 Maximian took the title of Augustus again and aided his son Maxentius and his rebellion in Italy. In April 307 he attempted to depose his son but failed and fled to the court of Constantius successor Constantine Maximians stepgrandson and soninlaw in Trier. At the Council of Carnuntum in November 308 Diocletian and his successor Galerius forced Maximian to renounce his imperial claim again. In early 310 Maximian attempted to seize Constantines title while the emperor was on campaign on the Rhine. Few supported him and he was captured by Constantine in Marseille. Maximian killed himself in mid310 on Constantines orders. During Constantines war with Maxentius Maximians image was purged from all public places. However after Constantine ousted and killed Maxentius Maximians image was rehabilitated and he was deified. Early lifeedit Antoninianus of Maximian. Legend imp maximianus aug. An Argenteus of Maximian. Legend maximianus aug. Maximian was born around 2504 near Sirmium modern Sremska Mitrovica Serbia in the province of Pannonia into a family of shopkeepers.56 Beyond that the ancient sources contain vague allusions to Illyricum as his homeland7 to his Pannonian virtues8 and to his harsh upbringing along the wartorn Danube frontier.9 Maximian joined the army serving with Diocletian under the emperors Aurelian r. 270275 and Probus r. 276282. He probably participated in the Mesopotamian campaign of Carus in 283 and attended Diocletians election as emperor on 20 November 284 at Nicomedia.10 Maximians swift appointment by Diocletian as Caesar is taken by the writer Stephen Williams and historian Timothy Barnes to mean that the two men were longterm allies that their respective roles were preagreed and that Maximian had probably supported Diocletian during his campaign against Carinus r. 283285 but there is no direct evidence for this.11 With his great energy firm aggressive character and disinclination to rebel Maximian was an appealing candidate for imperial office. The fourthcentury historian Aurelius Victor described Maximian as a colleague trustworthy in friendship if somewhat boorish and of great military talents.12 Despite his other qualities Maximian was uneducated and preferred action to thought. The panegyric of 289 after comparing his actions to Scipio Africanus victories over Hannibal during the Second Punic War suggested that Maximian had never heard of them.13 His ambitions were purely military he left politics to Diocletian.14 The Christian rhetor Lactantius suggested that Maximian shared Diocletians basic attitudes but was less puritanical in his tastes and took advantage of the sensual opportunities his position as emperor offered.15 Lactantius charged that Maximian defiled senators daughters and traveled with young virgins to satisfy his unending lust though Lactantius credibility is undermined by his general hostility towards pagans.16 Maximian had two children with his Syrian wife Eutropia Maxentius and Fausta. There is no direct evidence in the ancient sources for their birthdates. Modern estimates of Maxentius birth year have varied from c. 276 to 28317 and most date Faustas birth to c. 289 or 2
90.1 8 Theodora the wife of Constantius Chlorus is often called Maximians stepdaughter by ancient sources leading to claims by Otto Seeck and Ernest Stein that she was born from an earlier marriage between Eutropia and Afranius Hannibalianus.19 Barnes challenges this view saying that all stepdaughter sources derive their information from the partially unreliable work of history Kaisergeschichte while other more reliable sources refer to her as Maximians natural daughter.20 Barnes concludes that Theodora was born no later than c. 275 to an unnamed earlier wife of Maximian possibly one of Hannibalianus daughters.21 Appointment as Caesaredit At Mediolanum Milan Italy in July 28522 Diocletian appointed Maximian as his heirapparent and subordinate with the title Caesar.23 The reasons for this decision are complex. With conflict in every province of the Empire from Gaul to Syria from Egypt to the lower Danube Diocletian needed a lieutenant to manage his heavy workload.24 Historian Stephen Williams suggests that Diocletian considered himself a mediocre general and needed a man like Maximian to do most of his fighting.25 Diocletian Maximians senior colleague and Augustus in the east. Next Diocletian was vulnerable in that he had no sons just a daughter Valeria who could never succeed him. He was forced therefore to seek a coruler from outside his family and that coruler had to be someone he trusted.26 The historian William Seston has argued that Diocletian like heirless emperors before him adopted Maximian as his filius Augusti Augustan son upon his appointment to the office. Some agree but the historian Frank Kolb has stated that arguments for the adoption are based on misreadings of the papyrological evidence.27 Maximian did take Diocletians nomen family name Valerius however.28 Finally Diocletian knew that single rule was dangerous and that precedent existed for dual rulership. Despite their military prowess both soleemperors Aurelian and Probus had been easily removed from power.29 In contrast just a few years earlier the emperor Carus and his sons had ruled jointly albeit not for long. Even the first emperor Augustus r. 27 BCAD 14 had shared power with his colleagues and more formal offices of coemperor had existed from Marcus Aurelius r. 161180 on.30 The dual system evidently worked well. About 287 after Maximians appointment as Augustus the two rulers relationship was redefined in religious terms with Diocletian assuming the title Iovius and Maximian Herculius.31 The titles were pregnant with symbolism DiocletianJove had the dominant role of planning and commanding MaximianHercules the heroic role of completing assigned tasks.32 Yet despite the symbolism the emperors were not gods in the Imperial cult although they may have been hailed as such in Imperial panegyrics. Instead they were the gods instruments imposing the gods will on earth.33 Once the rituals were over Maximian assumed control of the government of the West and was dispatched to Gaul to fight the rebels known as Bagaudae while Diocletian returned to the East.34 Early campaigns in Gaul and Germanyedit Over lifesized marble head of a Tetrarch possibly Maximian or Diocletian found in Italy.35 The Bagaudae of Gaul are obscure figures appearing fleetingly in the ancient sources with their 285 uprising being their first appearance.36 The fourthcentury historian Eutropius described them as rural people under the leadership of Amandus and Aelianus while Aurelius Victor called them bandits.37 The historian David S. Potter suggests that they were more than peasants seeking either Gallic political autonomy or reinstatement of the recently deposed Carus a native of Gallia Narbonensis in what would become southern France in this case they would be defecting imperial troops not brigands.38 Although poorly equipped led and trained  and therefore a poor match for Roman legions  Diocletian certainly considered the Bagaudae sufficient threat to merit an emperor to counter them.39 Maximian has been implicated in a massacre of Coptic Christian troops from the headquarters unit of a legion raised in Thebes at Aucanus in modern Switzerland in early 285 during the preparations for the campaign against the Bagaudae.40 Maximian traveled to Gaul engaging the Bagaudae late in mid2
85.4 1 Details of the campaign are sparse and provide no tactical detail the historical sources dwell only on Maximians virtues and victories. The panegyric to Maximian in 289 records that the rebels were defeated with a blend of harshness and leniency.42 As the campaign was against the Empires own citizens and therefore distasteful it went unrecorded in titles and official triumphs. Indeed Maximians panegyrist declares I pass quickly over this episode for I see in your magnanimity you would rather forget this victory than celebrate it.43 By the end of the year the revolt had significantly abated and Maximian moved the bulk of his forces to the Rhine frontier heralding a period of stability.44 Maximian did not put down the Bagaudae swiftly enough to avoid a Germanic reaction. In late 285 two barbarian armies  one of Burgundians and Alamanni the other of Chaibones and Heruli  forded the Rhine and entered Gaul.45 The first army was left to die of disease and hunger while Maximian intercepted and defeated the second.46 He then established a Rhine headquarters in preparation for future campaigns47 either at Moguntiacum Mainz Germany Augusta Treverorum Trier Germany or Colonia Agrippina Cologne Germany.48 Carausiusedit See also Carausius and Carausian Revolt A Roman antefix roof tile showing the badge and standard of Legio XX Valeria Victrix one of the legions that joined Carausius rebellion Although most of Gaul was pacified regions bordering the English Channel still suffered from Frankish and Saxon piracy. The emperors Probus and Carinus had begun to fortify the Saxon Shore but much remained to be done.49 For example there is no archaeological evidence of naval bases at Dover and Boulogne during 2702
85.5 0 In response to the pirate problem Maximian appointed Mausaeus Carausius a Menapian from Germania Inferior southern and western Netherlands to command the Channel and to clear it of raiders.51 Carausius fared well52 and by the end of 285 he was capturing pirate ships in great numbers.53 Maximian soon heard that Carausius was waiting until the pirates had finished plundering before attacking and keeping their booty himself instead of returning it to the population at large or into the imperial treasury.54 Maximian ordered Carausius arrest and execution prompting him to flee to Britain. Carausius support among the British was strong and at least two British legions II Augusta and XX Valeria Victrix defected to him as did some or all of a legion near Boulogne probably XXX Ulpia Victrix.55 Carausius quickly eliminated the few remaining loyalists in his army and declared himself Augustus.56 Maximian could do little about the revolt. He had no fleet  he had given it to Carausius  and was busy quelling the Heruli and the Franks. Meanwhile Carausius strengthened his position by enlarging his fleet enlisting Frankish mercenaries and paying his troops well.56 By late 286 Britain much of northwestern Gaul and the entire Channel coast was under his control.57 Carausius declared himself head of an independent British state an Imperium Britanniarum and issued coin of a markedly higher purity than that of Maximian and Diocletian earning the support of British and Gallic merchants.58 Even Maximians troops were vulnerable to Carausius influence and wealth.59 Maximian appointed Augustusedit Aureus of Maximian minted in Antioch. Legend maximianus augustus  consul iiii pp maximianus proconnsul. Spurred by the crisis with Carausius on 1 April 28660 Maximian took the title of Augustus emperor.61 This gave him the same status as Carausius  so the clash was between two Augusti rather than between an Augustus and a Caesar  and in Imperial propaganda Maximian was proclaimed Diocletians brother his equal in authority and prestige.62 Diocletian could not have been present at Maximians appointment63 causing Seeck to suggest that Maximian usurped the title and was only later recognized by Diocletian in hopes of avoiding civil war. This suggestion has not won much support and the historian William Leadbetter has recently refuted it.64 Despite the physical distance between the emperors Diocletian trusted Maximian enough to invest him with imperial powers and Maximian still respected Diocletian enough to act in accordance with his will.65 In theory the Roman Empire was not divided by the dual imperium. Though divisions did take place  each emperor had his own court army and official residences  these were matters of practicality not substance. Imperial propaganda from 287 on insists on a singular and indivisible Rome a patrimonium indivisum.66 As the panegyrist of 289 declares to Maximian So it is that this great empire is a communal possession for both of you without any discord nor would we endure there to be any dispute between you but plainly you hold the state in equal measure as once those two Heracleidae the Spartan Kings had done.67 Legal rulings were given and imperial celebrations took place in both emperors names and the same coins were issued in both parts of the empire.68 Diocletian sometimes issued commands to Maximians province of Africa Maximian could presumably have done the same for Diocletians territory.69 Campaigns against Rhenish tribesedit Campaigns in 286 and 2
87 edit Maximian realized that he could not immediately suppress Carausius and campaigned instead against Rhenish tribes.70 These tribes were probably greater threats to Gallic peace anyway and included many supporters of Carausius.71 Although Maximian had many enemies along the river they were more often in dispute with each other than in combat with the Empire.72 Few clear dates survive for Maximians campaigns on the Rhine beyond a general range of 285 to 2
88.7 3 While receiving the consular fasces on 1 January 287 Maximian was interrupted by news of a barbarian raid. Doffing his toga and donning his armor he marched against the barbarians and although they were not entirely dispersed he celebrated a victory in Gaul later that year.74 Maximian believed the Burgundian and Alemanni tribes of the MoselleVosges region to be the greatest threat so he targeted them first. He campaigned using scorched earth tactics laying waste to their land and reducing their numbers through famine and disease. After the Burgundians and Alemanni Maximian moved against the weaker Heruli and Chaibones. He cornered and defeated them in a single battle. He fought in person riding along the battle line until the Germanic forces broke. Roman forces pursued the fleeing tribal armies and routed them. With his enemies weakened from starvation72 Maximian launched a great invasion across the Rhine.75 He moved deep into Germanic territory bringing destruction to his enemies homelands72 and demonstrating the superiority of Roman arms.76 By the end of 287 he had the advantage and the Rhenish lands were free of Germanic tribesmen.72 Maximians panegyrist declared All that I see beyond the Rhine is Roman.77 Constantius Chlorus Maximians praetorian prefect and husband to his daughter Theodora Joint campaign against the Alamanniedit Early the next year as Maximian made preparations for dealing with Carausius Diocletian returned from the East.78 The emperors met that year but neither date nor place is known with certainty.79 They probably agreed on a joint campaign against the Alamanni and a naval expedition against Carausius.80 Later in the year Maximian led a surprise invasion of the Agri Decumates  a region between the upper Rhine and upper Danube deep within Alamanni territory  while Diocletian invaded Germany via Raetia. Both emperors burned crops and food supplies as they went destroying the Germans means of sustenance.81 They added large swathes of territory to the Empire and allowed Maximians buildup to proceed without further disturbance.82 In the aftermath of the war towns along the Rhine were rebuilt bridgeheads created on the eastern banks at such places as Mainz and Cologne and a military frontier was established comprising forts roads and fortified towns. A military highway through Tornacum Tournai Belgium Bavacum Bavay France Atuatuca Tungrorum Tongeren Belgium Mosae Trajectum Maastricht Netherlands and Cologne connected points along the frontier.83 Constantius Gennobaudes and resettlementedit In early 288 Maximian appointed his praetorian prefect Constantius Chlorus husband of Maximians daughter Theodora to lead a campaign against Carausius Frankish allies. These Franks controlled the Rhine estuaries thwarting seaattacks against Carausius. Constantius moved north through their territory wreaking havoc and reaching the North Sea. The Franks sued for peace and in the subsequent settlement Maximian reinstated the deposed Frankish king Gennobaudes.74 Gennobaudes became Maximians vassal and with lesser Frankish chiefs in turn swearing loyalty to Gennobaudes Roman regional dominance was assured.84 Maximian allowed a settlement of Frisii Salian Franks Chamavi and other tribes along a strip of Roman territory either between the Rhine and Waal rivers from Noviomagus Nijmegen Netherlands to Traiectum Utrecht Netherlands83 or near Trier.76 These tribes were allowed to settle on the condition that they acknowledged Roman dominance. Their presence provided a ready pool of manpower and prevented the settlement of other Frankish tribes giving Maximian a buffer along the northern Rhine and reducing his need to garrison the region.83 Later campaigns in Britain and Gauledit Failed expedition against Carausiusedit Carausius rebel emperor of Roman Britain. Legend IMP. CARAVSIVS P. F. AVG.  LEGion IIII FL  ML Londinium mint By 289 Maximian was prepared to invade Carausius Britain but for some reason the plan failed. Maximians panegyrist of 289 was optimistic about the campaigns prospects but the panegyrist of 291 made no mention of it.85 Constantius panegyrist suggested that his fleet was lost to a storm86 but this might simply have been to diminish the embarrassment of defeat.87 Diocletian curtailed his Eastern province tour soon after perhaps on learning of Maximians failure.88 Diocletian returned in haste to the West reaching Emesa by 10 May 29089 and Sirmium on the Danube by 1 July 2
90.9 0 Diocletian met Maximian in Milan either in late December 290 or January 2
91.9 1 Crowds gathered to witness the event and the emperors devoted much time to public pageantry.92 Potter among others has surmised that the ceremonies were arranged to demonstrate Diocletians continuing support for his faltering colleague. The rulers discussed matters of politics and war in secret93 and they may have considered the idea of expanding the imperial college to include four emperors the Tetrarchy.94 Meanwhile a deputation from the Roman Senate met with the rulers and renewed its infrequent contact with the imperial office.95 The emperors would not meet again until 3
03.9 6 Following Maximians failure to invade in 289 an uneasy truce with Carausius began. Maximian tolerated Carausius rule in Britain and on the continent but refused to grant the secessionist state formal legitimacy. For his part Carausius was content with his territories beyond the Continental coast of Gaul.97 Diocletian however would not tolerate this affront to his rule. Faced with Carausius secession and further challenges on the Egyptian Syrian and Danubian borders he realized that two emperors were insufficient to manage the Empire.98 On 1 March 293 at Milan Maximian appointed Constantius to the office of Caesar.99 On either the same day or a month later Diocletian did the same for Galerius thus establishing the Tetrarchy or rule of four.100 Constantius was made to understand that he must succeed where Maximian had failed and defeat Carausius.101 Campaign against Allectusedit Allectus Carausius successor. Legend IMP. C. ALLECTVS P. F. AVG.  VIRTVS AVGusti  Senatus Consulto Constantius met expectations quickly and efficiently and by 293 had expelled Carausian forces from northern Gaul. In the same year Carausius was assassinated and replaced by his treasurer Allectus.102 Constantius marched up the coast to the Rhine and Scheldt estuaries where he was victorious over Carausius Frankish allies taking the title Germanicus maximus.103 His sights now set on Britain Constantius spent the following years building an invasion fleet.104 Maximian still in Italy after the appointment of Constantius was apprised of the invasion plans and in mid296 returned to Gaul.105 There he held the Rhenish frontiers against Carausius Frankish allies while Constantius launched his invasion of Britain.106 Allectus was killed on the North Downs in battle with Constantius praetorian prefect Asclepiodotus. Constantius himself had landed near Dubris Dover and marched on Londinium London whose citizens greeted him as a liberator.107 Campaigns in North Africaedit Cuirassed statue of Maximian or Diocletian from the city of Utica in modern day Tunisia. Late 
3 rd century.108 With Constantius victorious return Maximian was able to focus on the conflict in Mauretania Northwest Africa.109 As Roman authority weakened during the third century nomadic Berber tribes harassed settlements in the region with increasingly severe consequences. In 289 the governor of Mauretania Caesariensis roughly modern Algeria gained a temporary respite by pitting a small army against the Bavares and Quinquegentiani but the raiders soon returned. In 296 Maximian raised an army from Praetorian cohorts Aquileian Egyptian and Danubian legionaries Gallic and German auxiliaries and Thracian recruits advancing through Spain later that year.110 He may have defended the region against raiding Moors111 before crossing the Strait of Gibraltar into Mauretania Tingitana roughly modern Morocco to protect the area from Frankish pirates.112 By March 297 Maximian had begun a bloody offensive against the Berbers. The campaign was lengthy and Maximian spent the winter of 297298 resting in Carthage before returning to the field.113 Not content to drive them back into their homelands in the Atlas Mountains  from which they could continue to wage war  Maximian ventured deep into Berber territory. The terrain was unfavorable and the Berbers were skilled at guerrilla warfare but Maximian pressed on. Apparently wishing to inflict as much punishment as possible on the tribes he devastated previously secure land killed as many as he could and drove the remainder back into the Sahara.114 His campaign was concluded by early 298 and on 10 March he made a triumphal entry into Carthage.115 Inscriptions there record the peoples gratitude to Maximian hailing him  as Constantius had been on his entry to London  as redditor lucis aeternae restorer of the eternal light.114 Maximian returned to Italy in early 299 to celebrate another triumph in Rome.116 After his Mauretanian campaign in 299 Maximian returned to the north of Italy living a life of leisure in palaces in Milan and Aquilea and leaving warfare to his subordinate Constantius.117 Maximian was more aggressive in his relationship with the Senate than Constantius and Lactantius contends that he terrorized senators to the point of falsely charging and subsequently executing several including the prefect of Rome in 30
12.1 18 In contrast Constantius kept up good relations with the senatorial aristocracy and spent his time in active defense of the empire. He took up arms against the Franks in 300 or 301 and in 302  while Maximian was resting in Italy  continued to campaign against Germanic tribes on the Upper Rhine.111 According to Aurelius Victor he also built a palace near his home town of Sirmium.119 In addition to the imperial palace in Sirmium another palace has been found at Glac which may be that of Maximian.120 Retirementedit Diocletians vicennalia the 
20 year anniversary of his reign was celebrated in Rome in 303. Some evidence suggests that it was then that Diocletian exacted a promise from Maximian to retire together passing their titles as Augusti to the Caesars Constantius and Galerius.121 Presumably Maximians son Maxentius and Constantiuss son Constantine  children raised in Nicomedia together  would then become the new Caesars. While Maximian might not have wished to retire Diocletian was still in control and there was little resistance. Before retirement Maximian would receive one final moment of glory by officiating at the Secular Games in 3
04.1 22 Silvered follis struck in Aquileia 305306 AD commemorating Maximians abdication. Legend DN MAXIMIANVS BAEATISSIMO SEN. AVG.  PROVIDENTIA DEORVM QVIES AVGG. S F  AQS Aquileia mint On 1 May 305 in separate ceremonies in Milan and Nicomedia Diocletian and Maximian retired simultaneously. The succession did not go entirely to Maximians liking perhaps because of Galerius influence Galerius former army comrade Severus and Galerius nephew Maximinus both of whom had long military careers were appointed Caesar thus excluding Constantine and Maxentius.123 Maximian quickly soured to the new tetrarchy which saw Galerius assume the dominant position Diocletian once held. Although Maximian led the ceremony that proclaimed Severus as Caesar within two years he was sufficiently dissatisfied to support his sons rebellion against the new regime.124 Diocletian retired to the expansive palace he had built in his homeland Dalmatia near Salona on the Adriatic. Maximian retired to villas in Campania Lucania or Sirmium where he lived a life of ease and luxury.125 Although far from the political centers of the Empire Diocletian and Maximian remained close enough to stay in regular contact.126 Maxentius rebellionedit After the death of Constantius on 25 July 306 Constantine assumed the title of Augustus. This displeased Galerius who instead offered Constantine the title of Caesar which Constantine accepted. The title of Augustus then went to Severus.127 Maxentius was jealous of Constantines power and on 28 October 306 he persuaded a cohort of imperial guardsmen to declare him Augustus. Uncomfortable with sole leadership Maxentius sent a set of imperial robes to Maximian and saluted him as Augustus for the second time offering him theoretic equal rule but less actual power and a lower rank.128 Galerius refused to recognize Maxentius and sent Severus with an army to Rome to depose him. As many of Severus soldiers had served under Maximian and had taken Maxentius bribes most of the army defected to Maxentius. Severus fled to Ravenna which Maximian besieged. The city was strongly fortified so Maximian offered terms which Severus accepted. Maximian then seized Severus and took him under guard to a public villa in southern Rome where he was kept as a hostage. In late 307 Galerius led a second force against Maxentius but he again failed to take Rome and retreated north with his army mostly intact.129 Dresden bust of Maxentius While Maxentius built up Romes defenses Maximian made his way to Gaul to negotiate with Constantine. A deal was struck in which Constantine would marry Maximians younger daughter Fausta and be elevated to Augustan rank in Maxentius secessionist regime. In return Constantine would reaffirm the old family alliance between Maximian and Constantius and support Maxentius cause in Italy but would remain neutral in the war with Galerius. The deal was sealed with a double ceremony in Trier in late 307 at which Constantine married Fausta and was declared Augustus by Maximian.130 Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 3078 but soon fell out with his son and in early 308 challenged his right to rule before an assembly of Roman soldiers. He spoke of Romes sickly government disparaged Maxentius for having weakened it and ripped the imperial toga from Maxentius shoulders. He expected the soldiers to recognize him but they sided with Maxentius afterward Maximian was forced to leave Italy in disgrace.131 On 11 November 308 to resolve the political instability Galerius called Diocletian out of retirement and Maximian to a general council meeting at the military city of Carnuntum on the upper Danube. There Maximian was forced to abdicate again and Constantine was again demoted to Caesar with Maximinus the Caesar in the east. Licinius a loyal military companion to Galerius was appointed Augustus of the West.132 In early 309 Maximian returned to the court of Constantine in Gaul the only court that would still accept him.133 After Constantine and Maximinus refused to be placated with the titles of Sons of the Augusti they were promoted in early 310 with the result that there were now four Augusti.134 Rebellion against Constantineedit Head of the Colossus of Constantine In 310 Maximian rebelled against Constantine while the Emperor was on campaign against the Franks. Maximian had been sent south to Arles with part of Constantines army to defend against attacks by Maxentius in southern Gaul. In Arles Maximian announced that Constantine was dead and took up the imperial purple. Although Maximian offered bribes to all who would support him most of Constantines army remained loyal and Maximian was compelled to leave the city. Constantine soon heard of the rebellion abandoned his campaign against the Franks and moved quickly to southern Gaul where he confronted the fleeing Maximian at Massilia Marseille. The town was better able to withstand a long siege than Arles but it made little difference as loyal citizens opened the rear gates to Constantine. Maximian was captured reproved for his crimes and stripped of his title for the third and last time. Constantine granted Maximian some clemency but strongly encouraged his suicide. In July 310 Maximian hanged himself.135 Despite the earlier rupture in relations after Maximians suicide Maxentius presented himself as his fathers devoted son.136 He minted coins bearing his fathers deified image and proclaimed his desire to avenge his death.137 Constantine initially presented the suicide as an unfortunate family tragedy. By 311 however he was spreading another version. According to this after Constantine had pardoned him Maximian planned to murder Constantine in his sleep. Fausta learned of the plot and warned Constantine who put a eunuch in his own place in bed. Maximian was apprehended when he killed the eunuch and was offered suicide which he accepted.138 In addition to the propaganda Constantine instituted a damnatio memoriae on Maximian destroying all inscriptions referring to him and eliminating any public work bearing his image.139 Constantine defeated Maxentius at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge on 28 October 312. Maxentius died and Italy came under Constantines rule.140 Eutropia swore on oath that Maxentius was not Maximians son and Maximians memory was rehabilitated. His apotheosis under Maxentius was declared null and void and he was reconsecrated as a god probably in 317. He began appearing on Constantines coinage as divus or divine by 318 together with the deified Constantius and Claudius Gothicus.141 The three were hailed as Constantines forebears.
