During his reign he campaigned aided by Diocletian against the Sasanian Empire sacking their capital Ctesiphon in 299. He also campaigned across the Danube against the Carpi defeating them in 297 and 300. Although he was a staunch opponent of Christianity Galerius ended the Diocletianic Persecution when he issued the Edict of Toleration in Serdica Sofia in 311. Early lifeedit Galerius was born near Serdica12 in Dacia Ripensis later named Dacia Mediterranea though some modern scholars consider the strategic site where he later built his palace named after his mother  Felix Romuliana Gamzigrad  his birth and funeral place.6 His Thracian father and his Dacian mother Romula had left Roman Dacia today Romania because of the Carpians attacks.131419 He originally followed his fathers occupation that of a herdsman where he was nicknamed Armentarius herdsman Latin armentum lit.herd.15 His original cognomen was Maximinus but he changed it to Maximianus after becoming Caesar.3 Diocletian Galerius fatherinlaw and senior emperor He served with distinction as a soldier under Emperors Aurelian and Probus and in 293 at the establishment of the Tetrarchy was designated Caesar along with Constantius Chlorus receiving in marriage Diocletians daughter Valeria later known as Galeria Valeria and at the same time being entrusted with the care of the Illyrian provinces. After a few years campaigning against Sarmatians and Goths on the Danube he received command of the legions on the eastern imperial limits. Soon after his appointment Galerius was dispatched to Egypt to fight the rebellious cities Busiris and Coptos.16 War with Persiaedit See also RomanIranian relations and RomanPersian Wars Invasion counterinvasionedit In 294 Narseh a son of Shapur I who had been passed over for the Sassanid succession came into power in Persia. Narseh probably moved to eliminate Bahram III a young man installed by a noble named Vahunam in the wake of Bahram IIs death in 2
93.1 71869 In early 294 Narseh sent Diocletian the customary package of gifts but within Persia he was destroying every trace of his immediate predecessors erasing their names from public monuments. He sought to identify himself with the warlike reigns of Ardashir r. 226241 and Shapur r. 241272 who had sacked Roman Antioch and captured Emperor Valerian.186970 In 295 or 296 Narseh declared war on Rome. He appears to have first invaded western Armenia retaking the lands delivered to Tiridates in the peace of 287. He occupied the lands there until the following year.17192021 The historian Ammianus Marcellinus circa 320395 is the only source detailing the initial invasion of Armenia.22 Southern 1999 149 dates the invasion to 295 Barnes 1982 17 293 mentions an earlier unsuccessful invasion by Narseh based on the fact that the title Persici Maximi was given to all four emperors Odahl 2004 59 concurs with Barnes and suggests that Saracen princes in the Syrian desert collaborated with Narsehs invasion. Narseh then moved south into Roman Mesopotamia where he inflicted a severe defeat on Galerius then commander of the eastern forces in the region between Carrhae Harran Turkey and Callinicum Raqqa Syria.20 Diocletian may or may not have been present at the battle23 but presented himself soon afterwards at Antioch issuing an official version of events which placed all the blame for the affair upon Galerius. In Antioch Diocletian forced Galerius to walk a mile in advance of his imperial cart while still clad in the purple robes of an emperor.2420 David Stone Potter reads a symbolic message in the display the loss at Carrhae was due not to the failings of the empires soldiers but to the failings of their commander and Galerius failures would not be accepted.25 Another scholar Roger Rees suggests that Galerius position at the head of the caravan was merely the conventional organization of an imperial progression designed to show a Caesars deference to his Augustus.26 Detail of Galerius attacking Narseh on the Arch of Galerius at Thessaloniki Greece the city where Galerius carried out most of his administrative actions.27 Galeriuss army was reinforced probably in the spring of 298 by new contingents collected from the empires Danubian holdings.28 Narseh did not advance from Armenia and Mesopotamia leaving Galerius to lead the offensive in 298 with an attack on northern Mesopotamia via Armenia.25 Diocletian may or may not have been present to assist the campaign.29 Narseh retreated to Armenia to fight Galerius force putting himself at a disadvantage the rugged Armenian terrain was favorable to Roman infantry but not to Sassanid cavalry. Local aid gave Galerius the advantage of surprise over the Persian forces and he defeated Narseh in two successive battles.2528 During the second encounter the Battle of Satala in 298 Roman forces seized Narsehs camp his treasury his harem and his wife.2528 Narsehs wife would live out the remainder of the war in Daphne a suburb of Antioch serving as a constant reminder to the Persians of the Roman victory.25 Galerius advanced into Media and Adiabene winning continuous victories most prominently near Theodosiopolis Erzurum27 and securing Nisibis Nusaybin before 1 October 298. He moved down the Tigris taking Ctesiphon and gazing onwards to the ruins of Babylon before returning to Roman territory via the Euphrates.28 No source ever specifically claims that Ctesiphon was sacked but it is assumed to have been primarily due to the seizure of Narsehs wife and harem.30 Peace negotiationsedit Narseh had previously sent an ambassador to Galerius to plead for the return of his wife and children but Galerius had dismissed this ambassador reminding him of how Shapur had treated Valerian.28 In any case the Romans treated Narsehs captured family well perhaps seeking to evoke comparisons to Alexander and his beneficent conduct towards the family of Darius III.25 Peace negotiations began in the spring of 299 with both Diocletian and Galerius presiding. Their magister memoriae secretary Sicorius Probus was sent to Narseh to present terms.28 The conditions of the Peace of Nisibis were heavy25 Persia would give up territory to Rome making the Tigris the boundary between the two empires. Further terms specified that Armenia was returned to Roman domination with the fort of Ziatha as its border Caucasian Iberia would pay allegiance to Rome under a Roman appointee Nisibis now under Roman rule would become the sole conduit for trade between Persia and Rome and Rome would exercise control over the five satrapies between the Tigris and Armenia Ingilene Sophanene Sophene Arzanene Aghdznik Corduene and Zabdicene near modern Hakkri Turkey. These regions included the passage of the Tigris through the AntiTaurus range the Bitlis pass the quickest southerly route into Persian Armenia and access to the Tur Abdin plateau. With these territories Rome would have an advance station north of Ctesiphon and would be able to slow any future advance of Persian forces through the region.31 Under the terms of the peace Tiridates would regain both his throne and the entirety of his ancestral claim and Rome would secure a wide zone of cultural influence in the region.28 Because the empire was able to sustain such constant warfare on so many fronts it has been taken as a sign of the essential efficacy of the Diocletianic system and the goodwill of the army towards the tetrarchic enterprise.30 Rule as Augustusedit Aureus of Galerius marked MAXIMIANVS NOB CAES  IOVI CONS CAES. k After the abdication of Diocletian in 305 and the elevation of Constantius I and Galerius to the rank of Augustus two new Caesars were required to take their place. The two persons whom Galerius promoted to the rank of Caesar were very much his creatures and he hoped to enhance his authority throughout the empire with their elevation.33 First was Maximinus Daza whose mother was Galerius sister. An inexperienced youth with little formal education he was invested with the purple exalted to the dignity of Caesar and assigned the command of Egypt and Syria. Second was Severus Galerius comrade in arms he was sent to Mediolanum to receive the possession of Italy and Africa. According to the forms of the constitution Severus acknowledged the supremacy of the western emperor but he was absolutely devoted to the commands of his benefactor Galerius who reserving to himself the intermediate countries from the confines of Italy to those of Syria firmly established his power over threequarters of the empire.33 His hopes were dashed when his colleague Constantius died at York in 306 and the legions elevated his son Constantine to the position of Augustus. Galerius only discovered this when he received a letter from Constantine who informed him of his fathers death modestly asserted his natural claim to the succession and respectfully lamented that the enthusiastic violence of his troops had not allowed him to obtain the imperial purple in the regular and constitutional manner. The first emotions of Galerius were those of surprise disappointment and rage and as he could seldom restrain his passions he threatened to burn both the letter and the messenger.34353637 Later however when he had time to reconsider his position he inevitably saw that his chances of winning a war against Constantine were doubtful at best. Galerius was well aware of Constantines strengths  Constantine had been his guest for some time at Nicomedia  and knew that Constantius legions were wildly devoted to his son.33 Therefore without either condemning or ratifying the choice of the Roman army Galerius accepted the son of his deceased colleague as the ruler of the provinces beyond the Alps but he gave him only the title of Caesar and the fourth rank among the Roman princes whilst he conferred the vacant place of Augustus on his favourite Severus. GamzigradRomuliana Palace of Galerius in Zajear Serbia today an UNESCO World Heritage Site The ambitious spirit of Galerius was only just over this disappointment when he beheld the unexpected loss of Italy to Maxentius who was married to his daughter Valeria Maximilla.38 Galerius need for additional revenue had persuaded him to make a very strict and rigorous examination of the property of his subjects for the purpose of a general taxation. A very minute survey was taken of their real estates and wherever there was the slightest suspicion of concealment torture was used to obtain a sincere declaration of their personal wealth. Italy had traditionally been exempt from any form of taxation but Galerius ignored this precedent and the officers of the revenue already began to number the Roman people and to settle the proportion of the new taxes. Italy began to murmur against this indignity and Maxentius used this sentiment to declare himself emperor in Italy to the fury of Galerius. Therefore Galerius ordered his colleague Severus to immediately march to Rome in the full confidence that by his unexpected arrival he would easily suppress the rebellion.33 Severus was captured after his troops deserted to their old commander Maximian who had once again been elevated to the rank of coemperor this time by his son Maxentius. Severus was later executed. The importance of the occasion needed the presence and abilities of Galerius. At the head of a powerful army collected from Illyricum and the East he entered Italy determined to avenge Severus and to punish the rebellious Romans. But due to the skill of Maximian Galerius found every place hostile fortified and inaccessible and though he forced his way as far as Narni within sixty miles of Rome his control in Italy was confined to the narrow limits of his camp. Portrait of Galerius on his Arch Seeing that he was facing evergreater difficulties Galerius made the first advances towards reconciliation and dispatched two officers to tempt the Romans by the offer of a conference and the declaration of his paternal regard for Maxentius reminding them that they would obtain much more from his willing generosity than anything that might have been obtained through a military campaign. The offers of Galerius were rejected with firmness his friendship refused and it was not long before he discovered that unless he retreated he would share Severus fate. It was not a moment too soon large monetary gifts from Maxentius to his soldiers had corrupted the fidelity of the Illyrian legions. When Galerius finally began his withdrawal from Italy it was only with great difficulty that he managed to stop his veterans deserting him.33 In frustration Galerius allowed his legions to ravage the countryside as they passed northwards. Maxentius declined to make a general engagement. With so many emperors now in existence in 308 Galerius together with the retired emperor Diocletian and the now active Maximian called an imperial conference at Carnuntum on the River Danube to rectify the situation and bring some order back into the imperial government. Here it was agreed that Galerius longtime friend and military companion Licinius who had been entrusted by Galerius with the defense of the Danube while Galerius was in Italy would become Augustus in the West with Constantine as his Caesar. In the East Galerius remained Augustus and Maximinus remained his Caesar. Maximian was to retire and Maxentius was declared a usurper. Galerius plan soon failed. The news of Licinius promotion was no sooner carried into the East than Maximinus who governed the provinces of Egypt and Syria rejected his position as Caesar and notwithstanding the prayers as well as arguments of Galerius exacted the equal title of Augustus.33 Around the same time Maximian proclaimed himself emperor in Arles in opposition to Constantine who was campaigning against the Franks. For the first and indeed for the last time seven emperors administered the Roman world Galerius East Maximinus II East Licinius Middle Constantine I West Maximian West Maxentius Italy and Domitius Alexander Africa. The last years of Galerius saw him relinquishing his aspirations towards being the supreme ruler of the empire though he managed to retain the position of first among equals. He spent the remainder of his years enjoying himself and ordering some important public works such as discharging into the Danube the superfluous waters of Lake Pelso now Lake Balaton and cutting down the immense forests that encompassed it.33 Persecution of Christiansedit Main article Diocletian Persecution Detail of the Arch of Galerius in Thessaloniki. Christians had lived pleasantly during most of the rule of Diocletian. The persecutions that began with an edict of 24 February 303 were credited by Christians to Galerius work as he was a fierce advocate of the old ways and old gods. Christian houses of assembly were destroyed for fear of sedition in secret gatherings. Diocletian was not antiChristian during the first part of his reign and historians have claimed that Galerius decided to prod him into persecuting them by secretly burning the Imperial Palace and blaming it on Christian saboteurs. Regardless of who was at fault for the fire Diocletians rage was aroused and he began one of the last and greatest Christian persecutions in the history of the Roman Empire.citation needed It was at the insistence of Galerius that the last edicts of persecution against the Christians were published beginning in 303 and this policy of repression was maintained by him until the appearance of the general edict of toleration issued in Serdica394041 in April 311 apparently during his last bout of illness see Edict of Toleration by Galerius. Galeriuss last request was that Christians should pray for him as he suffered with a painful and fatal illness.42 Initially one of the leading figures in the persecutions Galerius later admitted that the policy of trying to eradicate Christianity had failed saying wherefore for this our indulgence they ought to pray to their God for our safety for that of the republic and for their own that the republic may continue uninjured on every side and that they may be able to live securely in their homes. Lactantius gives the text of the edict in his moralized chronicle of the bad ends to which all the persecutors came De Mortibus Persecutorum.43 This marked the end of official persecution of Christians which was officially legalized two years later by Constantine and Licinius in the Edict of Milan. Deathedit Head in the Canellopoulos Museum  once part of an over lifesized statue probably Galerius.4445 Galerius died in late April or early May 31146 from a horribly gruesome disease described by Eusebius47 and Lactantius48 possibly some form of bowel cancer gangrene or Fournier gangrene. Galerius was buried in his mausoleum at GamzigradRomuliana which was part of the palace he built at his birthplace todays Zajear in Serbia. Several lumps composed of corroded iron ring mail lorica hamata have been found at the site. This mail armour may have been worn by the wax figure of the emperor that was burned during the imperial funeral and apotheosis ceremony.49 The entire site has been inscribed into the World Heritage List in June 2007. AntiRoman accusationsedit According to Lactantius a Christian and adviser to Constantine Galerius affirmed his Dacian identity and avowed himself the enemy of the Roman name once made emperor even proposing that the empire should be called not the Roman but the Dacian Empire much to the horror of the patricians and senators. Lactantius further states that Galerius exhibited antiRoman attitude as soon as he had attained the highest power treating the Roman citizens with ruthless cruelty like the conquerors treated the conquered all in the name of the same treatment that the victorious Trajan had applied to the conquered Dacians forefathers of Galerius two centuries before.50 Honoursedit Galerius Peak in Antarctica is named after Emperor Galerius.51 Family treeedit v t e Simplified family tree of Tetrarchs See also Chronological scheme of the Tetrarchy 286324 DIOCLETIAN Iovius Western Emperor 286305 Prisca Afranius Hannibalianus disputedM 1 consul 292 Eutropia Maximian Herculius Western Emperor 286305 Unknown sister Galerius Eastern Emperor 305311 Galeria Valeria Helena Constantius I Western Emperor 305306 Constantinian Dynasty Flavia Maximiana Theodora Severus II Western Emperor 306307 Maximinus II Eastern Emperor 310313 Valeria Maximilla Maxentius Western Emperor 306312 Fausta Constantine I Roman Emperor 306337 Julius Constantius consul 335 Flavia Julia Constantia Licinius I Eastern Emperor 308324 Martinian Western Emperor 324 Valens I Western Emperor 316317 Valerius Romulus Constantine II Emperor 337340 Constantius II Emperor 337361 Constans I Emperor 337350 Julian II Emperor 361363 Licinius II caesar Notes  Timothy Barnes New Empire 3334 questions the parentage of Theodora shown here.

88 ff. stating that the evidence adduced the 
7 thcentury Paschal Chronicle Ol.268 and the contemporary Lactantius DMP 
19.2  is invalid and confused. Lactantius is commenting on Diocletian and the place where Diocletian was acclaimed and that the Maximianus in the text is therefore a later gloss the Paschal Chronicle is not authoritative for this period for events outside Egypt and may simply be commenting on the day when the laureled image of the new emperors arrived in Alexandria. Moreover Lactantius DMP 35 explicitly states that Galerius dies imperii fell on 1 March. Potter 2004 650 agrees that locating the acclamation to Nicomedia is false but believes that Sestons other evidence makes a strong case for a temporal lag between the two Caesars acclamations.  Sometimes called Maximian II 1011 since ancient sources often call him Galerius Maximianus.  Emperor Maximian apparently never issued any coinage when he was Caesar so coins with the name Maximianus Caesar must represent Galerius. The only source that refers to Maximian as having been Caesar is Eutropius.32 Referencesedit  Elsner Jas 2018. The Art of the Roman Empire AD 100450. Oxford University Press. p. 58.
