15 th and 
17 th dynasties are often combined under the group title Second Intermediate Period c. 16501550 BC a period that saw the division of Upper and Lower Egypt between the pharaohs at Thebes and the Hyksos kings of the 
15 th Dynasty based at Avaris. Identificationedit Of the two chief versions of Manethos Aegyptiaca the Sixteenth Dynasty is described by the more reliable4 Africanus supported by Syncellus5 as shepherd hyksos kings but by Eusebius as Theban.4 Ryholt 1997 followed by Bourriau 2003 in reconstructing the Turin canon interpreted a list of Thebesbased kings to constitute Manethos Sixteenth Dynasty although this is one of Ryholts most debatable and farreaching conclusions.4 For this reason other scholars do not follow Ryholt and see only insufficient evidence for the interpretation of the Sixteenth Dynasty as Theban.6 Historyedit The continuing war against 
15 th Dynasty dominated the shortlived 
16 th Dynasty. The armies of the 
15 th Dynasty winning town after town from their southern enemies continually encroached on the 
16 th Dynasty territory eventually threatening and then conquering Thebes itself. In his study of the Second Intermediate Period the Egyptologist Kim Ryholt has suggested that Dedumose I sued for a truce in the latter years of the dynasty3 but one of his predecessors Nebiryraw I may have been more successful and seems to have enjoyed a period of peace in his reign.3 Famine which had plagued Upper Egypt during the late 
13 th Dynasty and the 
14 th Dynasty also blighted the 
16 th Dynasty most evidently during and after the reign of Neferhotep III.3 Kingsedit Various chronological orderings and lists of kings have been proposed by scholars for this dynasty. These lists fall broadly in two categories those assuming that the 
16 th Dynasty comprised vassals of the Hyksos as advocated by Jrgen von Beckerath and Wolfgang Helck and those assuming that the 
16 th Dynasty was an independent Theban kingdom as recently proposed by Kim Ryholt. Vassals of the Hyksosedit The traditional list of rulers of the 
16 th Dynasty regroups kings believed to be vassals of the Hyksos some of which have semitic names such as Semqen and Anather. The list of kings differs from scholar to scholar and it is here given as per Jrgen von Beckeraths Dynasty XVXVI in his Handbuch der gyptischen Knigsnamen.7 Wolfgang Helck who also believes that the 
16 th Dynasty was an Hyksos vassal state proposed a slightly different list of kings.8 Many of the rulers listed here in the 
16 th Dynasty under the hypothesis that they were vassals of the Hyksos are put in the 
14 th Dynasty in the hypothesis that the 
16 th Dynasty was an independent Theban kingdom. The chronological ordering is largely uncertain. Dynasty XVXVI as vassals of the Hyksos7 Name of king Dates Comments AnatHar Possibly a prince of the

16 th Dynasty was an independent Theban kingdom. From Ryholts reconstruction of the Turin canon 15 kings can be associated to the dynasty several of whom are attested by contemporary sources.2 While most likely rulers based in Thebes itself some may have been local rulers from other important Upper Egyptian towns including Abydos El Kab and Edfu.2 By the reign of Nebiriau I the realm controlled by the 
16 th Dynasty extended at least as far north as Hu and south to Edfu.39 Not listed in the Turin canon after Ryholt is Wepwawetemsaf who left a stele at Abydos and was likely a local kinglet of the Abydos Dynasty.2 Ryholt gives the list of kings of the 
16 th Dynasty as shown in the table below.10 Others such as Helck Vandersleyen Bennett combine some of these rulers with the Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt.11 The list of rulers is given here as per Kim Ryholt and is supposedly in chronological order Dynasty XVI as an independent Theban kingdom12 Name of king Image Dates Comments Unknown 16491648 BC Name lost in a lacuna of the Turin canon Sekhemresementawi Djehuti 16481645 BC Sekhemreseusertawi Sobekhotep VIII 16451629 BC Sekhemreseankhtawi Neferhotep III 16291628 BC Seankhenre Mentuhotepi 16281627 BC Sewadjenre Nebiryraw I 16271601 BC Nebiriau II 1601 BC Semenre 16011600 BC Seuserenre Bebiankh 16001588 BC Sekhemre Shedwaset 1588 BC Unknown 15881582 BC Five kings lost in a lacuna of the Turin canon Additional kings are classified as belonging to this dynasty per Kim Ryholt but their chronological position is uncertain.
