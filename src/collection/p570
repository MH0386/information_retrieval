It contains a large pyramid and several mudbrick mastabas. The pyramid was Egypts first straightsided one but it partially collapsed in ancient times.2 The area is located around 72 kilometres 45 mi south of modern Cairo. Pyramidedit The structure of the pyramid The pyramid at Meidum is thought to be just the second pyramid built after Djosers3 and may have been originally built for Huni the last pharaoh of the Third Dynasty and continued by Sneferu. Because of its unusual appearance the pyramid is called elheram elkaddaab  False Pyramid in Egyptian Arabic. The pyramid was erected in three phases numbered E1 E2 and E3 by the archaeologist Borchardt ref. Borchardt Ludwig Die Entstehung der Pyramide an der Geschichte der Pyramide bei Meidum nachgewiesen Berlin 1928 ref.. E1 was a step pyramid similar to the Djoser Pyramid. E2 was an extension around the previous building of roughly 5 m width or 10 cubits raising the number of steps from 5 to 7. The second extension E3 turned the original step pyramid design into a true pyramid by filling in the steps with limestone encasing. While this approach is consistent with the design of the other true pyramids Meidum was affected by construction errors. Firstly the outer layer was founded on sand and not on rock like the inner layers. Secondly the inner step pyramids had been designed as the final stage. Thus the outer surface was polished and the platforms of the steps were not horizontal but fell off to the outside. This severely compromised the stability and is likely to have caused the collapse of the Meidum Pyramid in a downpour while the building was still under construction.4 Comparison of approximate profiles of the Meidum with some notable pyramidal or nearpyramidal buildings.

Franck Monnier5 and others believe the pyramid did not collapse until the New Kingdom but there are a number of facts contradicting this theory. The Meidum Pyramid seems never to have been completed. Beginning with Sneferu and to the 
12 th Dynasty all pyramids had a valley temple which is missing at Meidum. The mortuary temple which was found under the rubble at the base of the pyramid apparently never was finished. Walls were only partly polished. Two stelas inside usually bearing the names of the pharaoh are missing inscriptions. The burial chamber inside the pyramid itself is uncompleted with raw walls and wooden supports still in place which are usually removed after construction. Affiliated mastabas were never used or completed and none of the usual burials have been found. Finally the first examinations of the Meidum Pyramid found everything below the surface of the rubble mound fully intact. Stones from the outer cover were stolen only after they were exposed by the excavations. This makes a catastrophic collapse more probable than a gradual one. The collapse of this pyramid during the reign of Sneferu is the likely reason for the change from 54 to 43 degrees of his second pyramid at Dahshur the Bent Pyramid.4 By the time it was investigated by Napoleons Expedition in 1799 the Meidum Pyramid had its present three steps. It is commonly assumed the pyramid still had five steps in the fifteenth century and was gradually falling further into ruin because alMaqrizi described it as looking like a fivestepped mountain but Mendelssohn claimed this might be the result of a loose translation and alMakrizis words would more accurately translate into fivestoried mountain4 a description which could even match the present state of the pyramid with four bands of different masonry at the base and a step on top. The particular nature of the Meidum Pyramid building phases allows conclusions on the building process and the used ramp system. The pyramid extensions E2 and E3 both were ringshaped extensions only 5 m wide around the previous building core in full building height. Even the mass volume was relatively small compared with complete pyramids the building site required a full ramp system and had to be volumesaving and costeffective otherwise E2 would not have been repeated in E3 which applies for tangential ramps of 10 cubits or 
5 m width 
6 better source needed. Another observation are the ramp prints recesses in the wall at the eastern wall of the exposed third and fourth step of E2 showing a possible joint to a ramp of almost 5 m width with steep side slopes. The recesses were described by Borchardt and are still visible best in morning light.7 Borchardts interpretation as a trace of a straight long ramp is widely rejected and contradicted by the fact the recess at the third step is narrower than that of the fourth. More realistic would be a joint to tangential ramps integrated to the E2 steps. Lantern Slide Collection Views Objects Egypt. Meidum. Old Kingdom. Step Pyramid of Meidum

4 th Dyn. n.d. Brooklyn Museum Archives Excavationsedit Map of ancient Lower Egypt showing the location of Meidum The Meidum Pyramid was excavated by John Shae Perring in 1837 Lepsius in 1843 and then by Flinders Petrie later in the nineteenth century who located the mortuary temple facing to the east. In 1920 Ludwig Borchardt studied the area further followed by Alan Rowe in 1928 and then Ali elKholi in the 19
70 s. In its ruined state the structure is 213 feet 65 meters high and its entrance is aligned northsouth with the entrance in the north 66 feet 20 meters above present ground level. The steep descending passage 57 feet 17 meters long leads to a horizontal passage just below the original ground level that then leads to a vertical shaft 10 feet 
3.0  meters high that leads to the corbelled burial chamber itself. The chamber is unlikely to have been used for any burial. Flinders Petrie was the first Egyptologist to establish the facts of its original design dimensions and proportions.89 In its final form it was 1100 cubits of 
0.5 23 m around by 175 cubits high thus showing the same proportions as the Great Pyramid at Giza and therefore the same circular symbolism. Petrie wrote in the 1892 excavation report 10 that We see then that there is an exactly analogous theory for the dimensions of Medum sic to that of the Great Pyramid in each the approximate ratio of 744 is adopted as referred to the radius and circle ... These proportions equated to the four outer faces sloping in by precisely 
51.8 42 or 515035 which would have been understood and expressed by the Ancient Egyptians as a seked slope of 5 12 palms.11 Fragment of a limestone stela. Inscribed for the accountant of cattle Pahemy and his wife Iniuset.
