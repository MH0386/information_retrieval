Israela officially the State of Israelb is a country in the Southern Levant region of West Asia. It is bordered by Lebanon to the north Syria to the northeast Jordan to the east the Red Sea to the south Egypt to the southwest the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Palestinian territories  the West Bank along the east and the Gaza Strip along the southwest.21 Tel Aviv is the financial economic and technological center of the country while its seat of government is in its proclaimed capital of Jerusalem although Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem is unrecognized internationally.c23 Israel is located in a region known historically as Canaan Palestine and the Holy Land. In antiquity it was home to several Canaanite and later Israelite and Judahite states and is referred to as the Land of Israel in Jewish tradition. The region was successively conquered by the Assyrian Babylonian Achaemenid Hellenistic Roman and Byzantine empires Arab Caliphates Crusaders Ayyubids Mamluks and Ottomans. The late 
19 th century saw the rise of Zionism in Europe a movement seeking a Jewish homeland which garnered British support during World War I. During the war the Ottomans were defeated and the British Mandate for Palestine was set up in 1920. Jewish immigration to Mandatory Palestine increased considerably leading to intercommunal conflict between Jews and Arabs.24 The 1947 UN Partition Plan triggered a civil war between the two groups which saw the expulsion and flight of most of Palestines predominantly Arab population. The State of Israel declared its establishment on 14 May 1948 the day the British terminated the Mandate. On 15 May 1948 the armies of neighboring Arab states invaded the area of the former Mandatory Palestine starting the First ArabIsraeli War. The 1949 Armistice Agreements saw Israels borders established over most of the former Mandate territory while the rest the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were taken by Jordan and Egypt respectively.252627 The 1967 SixDay War saw Israel occupying the West Bank the Gaza Strip the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula and the Syrian Golan Heights. It has since established and continues to expand settlements across the occupied territories actions which are deemed illegal under international law and annexed both East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights which are largely unrecognized internationally. Since the 1973 Yom Kippur War Israel has signed peace treaties with Egypt returning the Sinai Peninsula and with Jordan and more recently normalized relations with several Arab countries. However efforts to resolve the IsraeliPalestinian conflict have not succeeded. Israels practices in its occupation of the Palestinian territories have drawn sustained international criticism along with accusations that it has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity against the Palestinian people from human rights organizations and United Nations officials. The country has a parliamentary system elected by proportional representation. The prime minister serves as head of government and is elected by the Knesset Israels unicameral legislature.28 Israel has one of the biggest economies in the Middle East by nominal GDP 29 it is one of the richest countries in the Middle East and Asia303132 and an OECD member since 20

Under the British Mandate 19201948 the whole region was known as Palestine.38 Upon establishment in 1948 the country formally adopted the name State of Israel Hebrew   Mednat Yisrel medinat jisael Arabic   Dawlat Isrl dawlat israil after other proposed names including Land of Israel Eretz Israel Ever from ancestor Eber Zion and Judea were considered but rejected39 while the name Israel was suggested by BenGurion and passed by a vote of 
63.4 0 In the early weeks after establishment the government chose the term Israeli to denote a citizen of the Israeli state.41 The names Land of Israel and Children of Israel have historically been used to refer to the biblical Kingdom of Israel and the entire Jewish people respectively.42 The name Israel Hebrew Ysrl Septuagint Greek  Isral El God persistsrules though after Hosea 124 often interpreted as struggle with God refers to the patriarch Jacob who according to the Hebrew Bible was given the name after he successfully wrestled with the angel of the Lord.43 The earliest known archaeological artefact to mention the word Israel as a collective is the Merneptah Stele of ancient Egypt dated to the late 
13 th century BCE.44 History Main article History of Israel For a chronological guide see Timeline of Israeli history. Early expansions of hominins out of Africa into the Levant where Israel is located dates back at least 
1.5  million years based on traces found at the Ubeidiya prehistoric site45 while the Skhul and Qafzeh hominins dating back 120000 years are some of the earliest traces of anatomically modern humans outside of Africa.46 The Natufian culture emerged in the southern Levant by the 
10 th millennium BCE47 followed by the Ghassulian culture by around 4500 BCE.48 Bronze and Iron Ages Main article History of ancient Israel and Judah Further information Canaan Israelites Kingdom of Israel Samaria and Kingdom of Judah Early references to Canaanites and Canaan appear in Near Eastern and Egyptian texts c. 2000 BCE these populations were structured as politically independent territorially based citystates.4950 During the Late Bronze Age 15501200 BCE large parts of Canaan formed vassal states paying tribute to the New Kingdom of Egypt.51 As a result of the Late Bronze Age collapse Canaan fell into chaos and Egyptian control over the region collapsed.5253 A people named Israel appear for the first time in the Merneptah Stele an ancient Egyptian inscription which dates to about 1200 BCE.54
55 fn 557 Ancestors of the Israelites are thought to have included ancient Semiticspeaking peoples native to this area.587879 Modern archaeological accounts suggest that the Israelites and their culture branched out of the Canaanite peoples59 through the development of a distinct monolatristicand later monotheisticreligion centered on Yahweh.6061 They spoke an archaic form of Hebrew known as Biblical Hebrew.62 Around the same time the Philistines settled on the southern coastal plain.6364 Modern archaeology has largely discarded the historicity of the narrative in the Torah concerning the patriarchs The Exodus and the tales of conquest in the Book of Joshua and instead views the narrative as the Israelites national myth.65 However some elements of these traditions do appear to have historical roots.666768 Map of Israel and Judah in the 
9 th century BCE There is debate about the earliest existence of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah and their extent and power. While it is unclear if there was ever a United Kingdom of Israel6970 historians and archaeologists agree that the northern Kingdom of Israel existed by ca. 900 BCE7116919572 and the Kingdom of Judah by ca. 850 BCE.7374 The Kingdom of Israel was the more prosperous of the two and soon developed into a regional power75 during the Omride dynasty it controlled Samaria Galilee the upper Jordan Valley the Sharon and large parts of the Transjordan.76 Samaria the capital was home to one of the largest Iron Age structures in the Levant.7778 The Kingdom of Israel was destroyed around 720 BCE when it was conquered by the NeoAssyrian Empire.79 The Kingdom of Judah with its capital in Jerusalem later became a client state of first the NeoAssyrian Empire and then the NeoBabylonian Empire. It is estimated that the regions population was around 400000 in the Iron Age II.80 In 5876 BCE following a revolt in Judah King Nebuchadnezzar II besieged and destroyed Jerusalem and Solomons Temple8182 dissolved the kingdom and exiled much of the Judean elite to Babylon beginning the Babylonian captivity.83 The defeat was recorded in the Babylonian Chronicles.8485 After capturing Babylon in 539 BCE Cyrus the Great founder of the Achaemenid Empire issued a proclamation allowing the exiled Judean population to return to Judah.8687 Classical antiquity Main article Second Temple period Further information Yehud province Hasmonean dynasty Herodian dynasty Judaea Roman province and Syria Palaestina The construction of the Second Temple was completed c.520 BCE.86 The Achaemenids ruled the region as the province of Yehud Medinata88 which had a population of around 30000 in the 
5 th to 
4 th centuries BCE.71308 In 332 BCE Alexander the Great of Macedon conquered the region as part of his campaign against the Achaemenid Empire. After his death the area was controlled by the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires as a part of CoeleSyria. Over the ensuing centuries the Hellenization of the region led to cultural tensions that came to a head during the reign of Antiochus IV giving rise to the Maccabean Revolt of 167 BCE. The civil unrest weakened Seleucid rule and in the late 
2 nd century the semiautonomous Hasmonean Kingdom of Judea arose eventually attaining full independence and expanding into neighboring regions.899091 Masada fortress the location of a 
1 stcentury Roman siege The Roman Republic invaded the region in 63 BCE first taking control of Syria and then intervening in the Hasmonean Civil War. The struggle between proRoman and proParthian factions in Judea led to the installation of Herod the Great as a dynastic vassal of Rome. In 6 CE the area was annexed as the Roman province of Judaea tensions with Roman rule led to a series of JewishRoman wars resulting in widespread destruction. The First JewishRoman War 6673 CE resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple and a sizable portion of the population being killed or displaced.92 A second uprising known as the Bar Kokhba revolt took place during 132136 CE. Initial successes allowed the Jews to form an independent state but the Romans massed large forces and brutally crushed the rebellion devastating and depopulating Judeas countryside.9293949596 Jerusalem was rebuilt as a Roman colony Aelia Capitolina and the province of Judea was renamed Syria Palaestina.9798 Jews were expelled from the districts surrounding Jerusalem9995 and joined communities in the diaspora.100 Nevertheless there was a continuous small Jewish presence and Galilee became its religious center.101102 Jewish communities also continued to reside in the southern Hebron Hills and on the coastal plain.95 Late antiquity and the medieval period Further information Diocese of the East Bilad alSham and Kingdom of Jerusalem

4 th century the situation for the Jewish majority in Palestine became more difficult.100 A series of laws were passed that discriminated against Jews and Judaism and Jews were persecuted by both the church and the authorities.105 Many Jews had emigrated to flourishing Diaspora communities106 while locally there was both Christian immigration and local conversion. By the middle of the 
5 th century there was a Christian majority.107108 Towards the end of the 
5 th century Samaritan revolts erupted continuing until the late 
6 th century and resulting in a large decrease in the Samaritan population.109 After the Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem and the shortlived Jewish revolt against Heraclius in 614 CE the Byzantine Empire reconsolidated control of the area in 6

18 th century local Arab Sheikh Zahir alUmar created a de facto independent Emirate in the Galilee. Ottoman attempts to subdue the Sheikh failed but after Zahirs death the Ottomans regained control of the area. In 1799 governor Jazzar Pasha repelled an assault on Acre by troops of Napoleon prompting the French to abandon the Syrian campaign.118 In 1834 a revolt by Palestinian Arab peasants against Egyptian conscription and taxation policies under Muhammad Ali was suppressed Muhammad Alis army retreated and Ottoman rule was restored with British support in 18
40.1 19 Shortly after the Tanzimat reforms were implemented across the Ottoman Empire. Since the existence of the Jewish diaspora many Jews have aspired to return to Zion.120 The Jewish population of Palestine from the outset of Ottoman rule to the beginning of the Zionist movement known as the Old Yishuv comprised a minority and fluctuated in size. During the 
16 th century Jewish communities struck roots in the Four Holy CitiesJerusalem Tiberias Hebron and Safedand in 1697 Rabbi Yehuda Hachasid led a group of 1500 Jews to Jerusalem.121 In the second half of the 
18 th century Eastern European Jews who were opponents of Hasidism known as the Perushim settled in Palestine.122123 The First Zionist Congress 1897 in Basel Switzerland The first wave of modern Jewish migration to Ottomanruled Palestine known as the First Aliyah began in 1881 as Jews fled pogroms in Eastern Europe.124 The ensuing May Laws of 1882 increased economic discrimination against the Jews and restricted where they could live.125126 In response political Zionism began to take form with some of its activists founding movements such as the Bilu and Lovers of Zion while Leon Pinsker published the pamphlet AutoEmancipation 1882 which urged Jews to seek national independence.127128 Theodor Herzl is credited with founding political Zionism129 a movement that sought to establish a Jewish state in the Land of Israel thus offering a solution to the socalled Jewish question of the European states.130 In 1896 Herzl published Der Judenstaat The Jewish State the following year he presided over the First Zionist Congress.131 The Second Aliyah 19041914 began after the Kishinev pogrom some 40000 Jews settled in Palestine although nearly half left eventually. Both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly Orthodox Jews132 although the Second Aliyah included Zionist socialist groups who established the kibbutz movement based on the idea of establishing a separate Jewish economy based exclusively on Jewish labor.133134 Those of the Second Aliyah who would go on to become the leaders of the Yishuv in the coming decades believed that the settler economy should not depend on Arab labor. This conquest of labor would be a dominant source of antagonism with the Arab population with the new Yishuvs nationalist ideology overpowering its socialist one.135 Though the immigrants of the Second Aliyah largely sought to create communal Jewish agricultural settlements the period saw the establishment of Tel Aviv as the first planned Jewish town in 1909. This period also saw the emergence of Jewish armed militias the first being BarGiora in 1907. Two years later the larger Hashomer organization was founded as its replacement. British Mandate for Palestine Main article Mandatory Palestine Further information Yishuv Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine and 1948 Palestine war See also Balfour Declaration United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and Jewish land purchase in Palestine Chaim Weizmanns efforts to garner British support for the Zionist movement would eventually secure the Balfour Declaration in 19
17.1 36 British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour sent the Balfour Declaration to Lord Rothschild a leader of the British Jewish community stating Britains support for the creation of a Jewish national home in Palestine.137138 Weizmann interpretation of the declaration entailed that negotiations on the future of the country were to happen directly between Britain and the Jews excluding Arab representation. His famous announcement at the Paris peace conference would reflect this interpretation stating that the goal to make Palestine as Jewish as England is English. The years that followed would see JewishArab relations in Palestine deteriorate dramatically.139 In 1918 the Jewish Legion a group primarily of Zionist volunteers assisted in the British conquest of Palestine.140 In 1920 the territory was divided between Britain and France under the mandate system and the Britishadministered area including modern Israel was named Mandatory Palestine.116141142 Arab opposition to British rule and Jewish immigration led to the 1920 Palestine riots and the formation of a Jewish militia known as the Haganah The Defense in Hebrew as an outgrowth of Hashomer from which the Irgun and Lehi paramilitaries later split.143 In 1922 the League of Nations granted Britain the Mandate for Palestine under terms which included the Balfour Declaration with its promise to the Jews and with similar provisions regarding the Arab Palestinians.144 The population of the area was predominantly Arab and Muslim with Jews accounting for about 11145 and Arab Christians about 
9.5  of the population.146 Jews and Arabs in Grim Struggle for Holy Land article from 1938 The Third 19191923 and Fourth Aliyahs 19241929 brought an additional 100000 Jews to Palestine. The rise of Nazism and the increasing persecution of Jews in 19
30 s Europe led to the Fifth Aliyah with an influx of a quarter of a million Jews. This was a major cause of the Arab revolt of 193639. The revolt which involved significant intercommunal fighting among the Arabs147 was suppressed by British security forces and Zionist militias. Several hundred British security personnel and Jews were killed while 5032 Arabs were killed 14760 were wounded and 12622 were detained.148149150 An estimated ten percent of the adult male Palestinian Arab population was killed wounded imprisoned or exiled.151 The British introduced restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine with the White Paper of 1939. With countries around the world turning away Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust a clandestine movement known as Aliyah Bet was organized to bring Jews to Palestine. By the end of World War II 31 of the total population of Palestine was Jewish.152 The UK found itself facing a Jewish insurgency over immigration restrictions and continued conflict with the Arab community over limit levels. The Haganah joined Irgun and Lehi in an armed struggle against British rule.153 At the same time hundreds of thousands of Jewish Holocaust survivors sought a new life far from their destroyed communities in Europe. The Haganah attempted to bring tens of thousands of Jewish refugees to Palestine by ship in a programme called Aliyah Bet. Most of the ships were intercepted by the Royal Navy and the refugees placed in detention camps in Atlit and Cyprus.154155 UN Map Palestine plan of partition with economic union On 22 July 1946 Irgun bombed the British administrative headquarters for Palestine killing 
91.1 56157158159160161 The attack initially had the approval of the Haganah. It was conceived as a response to Operation Agatha a series of raids including one on the Jewish Agency by the British and was the deadliest directed at the British during the Mandate era.160161 The Jewish insurgency continued throughout 1946 and 1947 despite concerted efforts by the British military and Palestine Police Force to suppress it. British efforts to mediate a negotiated solution with Jewish and Arab representatives also failed as the Jews were unwilling to accept any solution that did not involve a Jewish state and suggested a partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states while the Arabs were adamant that a Jewish state in any part of Palestine was unacceptable and that the only solution was a unified Palestine under Arab rule. In February 1947 the British referred the Palestine issue to the newly formed United Nations. On 15 May 1947 the UN General Assembly resolved that a Special Committee be created to prepare ... a report on the question of Palestine.162 The Report of the Committee163 proposed a plan to replace the British Mandate with an independent Arab State an independent Jewish State and the City of Jerusalem ... the last to be under an International Trusteeship System.164 Meanwhile the Jewish insurgency continued and peaked in July 1947 with a series of widespread guerrilla raids culminating in the Sergeants affair in which the Irgun took two British sergeants hostage as attempted leverage against the planned execution of three Irgun operatives. After the executions were carried out the Irgun killed the two British soldiers hanged their bodies from trees and left a booby trap at the scene which injured a British soldier. The incident caused widespread outrage in the UK.165 In September 1947 the British cabinet decided to evacuate Palestine as the Mandate was no longer tenable.165 On 29 November 1947 the General Assembly adopted Resolution 181 II.166 The plan attached to the resolution was essentially that proposed in the report of 3 September. The Jewish Agency the recognized representative of the Jewish community accepted the plan which assigned 5556 of Mandatory Palestine to the Jews. At the time the Jews were about a third of the population and owned around 67 of the land. Arabs constituted the majority and owned about 20 of the land with the remainder held by the Mandate authorities or foreign landowners.167168169170171172173 The Arab League and Arab Higher Committee of Palestine rejected it174 and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition.175176 On 1 December 1947 the Arab Higher Committee proclaimed a threeday strike and riots broke out in Jerusalem.177 The situation spiralled into a civil war just two weeks after the UN vote Colonial Secretary Arthur Creech Jones announced that the British Mandate would end on 15 May 1948 at which point the British would evacuate. As Arab militias and gangs attacked Jewish areas they were faced mainly by the Haganah as well as the smaller Irgun and Lehi. In April 1948 the Haganah moved onto the offensive.178179 During this period 250000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled due to numerous factors.180 State of Israel Main article History of Israel 19

The UN estimated that more than 700000 Palestinians were expelled by or fledwhat would become known in Arabic as the Nakba catastrophe.192 Some 156000 remained and became Arab citizens of Israel.193 Raising of the Ink Flag on 10 March 1949 marking the end of the 1948 war Israel was admitted as a member of the UN on 11 May 19

50 s was aided by the Israeli Immigration Department and the nongovernment sponsored Mossad LeAliyah Bet lit. Institute for Immigration B.198 The latter engaged in clandestine operations in countries particularly in the Middle East and Eastern Europe where the lives of Jews were believed to be in danger and exit was difficult. Mossad LeAliyah Bet was disbanded in 19
53.1 99 The immigration was in accordance with the One Million Plan. Some immigrants held Zionist beliefs or came for the promise of a better life while others moved to escape persecution or were expelled.200201 An influx of Holocaust survivors and Jews from Arab and Muslim countries to Israel during the first three years increased the number of Jews from 700000 to 1400000. By 1958 the population had risen to two million.202 Between 1948 and 1970 approximately 1150000 Jewish refugees relocated to Israel.203 Some new immigrants arrived as refugees and were housed in temporary camps known as maabarot by 1952 over 200000 people were living in these tent cities.204 Jews of European background were often treated more favorably than Jews from Middle Eastern and North African countrieshousing units reserved for the latter were often redesignated for the former so Jews newly arrived from Arab lands generally ended up staying longer in transit camps.205206 During this period food clothes and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the austerity period. The need to solve the crisis led BenGurion to sign a reparations agreement with West Germany that triggered mass protests by Jews angered at the idea that Israel could accept monetary compensation for the Holocaust.207 ArabIsraeli conflict Main article ArabIsraeli conflict During the 19
50 s Israel was frequently attacked by Palestinian fedayeen nearly always against civilians208 mainly from the Egyptianoccupied Gaza Strip209 leading to several Israeli reprisal operations. In 1956 the UK and France aimed at regaining control of the Suez Canal which Egypt had nationalized. The continued blockade of the Suez Canal and Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping together with increasing Fedayeen attacks against Israels southern population and recent Arab threatening statements prompted Israel to attack Egypt.210211212 Israel joined a secret alliance with the UK and France and overran the Sinai Peninsula in the Suez Crisis but was pressured to withdraw by the UN in return for guarantees of Israeli shipping rights.213214215 The war resulted in significant reduction of Israeli border infiltration.216 U.S. newsreel on the trial of Adolf Eichmann In the early 19
60 s Israel captured Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Argentina and brought him to Israel for trial.217 Eichmann remains the only person executed in Israel by conviction in an Israeli civilian court.218 During the spring and summer of 1963 Israel was engaged in a diplomatic standoff with the United States due to the Israeli nuclear programme.219220 Since 1964 Arab countries concerned over Israeli plans to divert waters of the Jordan River into the coastal plain221 had been trying to divert the headwaters to deprive Israel of water resources provoking tensions between Israel on the one hand and Syria and Lebanon on the other. Arab nationalists led by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser refused to recognize Israel and called for its destruction.222223224 By 1966 IsraeliArab relations had deteriorated to the point of battles taking place between Israeli and Arab forces.225 Territory held by Israel before the SixDay War after the war The Sinai Peninsula was returned to Egypt in 1982. In May 1967 Egypt massed its army near the border with Israel expelled UN peacekeepers stationed in the Sinai Peninsula since 1957 and blocked Israels access to the Red Sea.226227228 Other Arab states mobilized their forces.229 Israel reiterated that these actions were a casus belli and on 5 June launched a preemptive strike against Egypt. Jordan Syria and Iraq attacked Israel. In a SixDay War Israel captured and occupied the West Bank from Jordan the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt and the Golan Heights from Syria.230 Jerusalems boundaries were enlarged incorporating East Jerusalem and the 1949 Green Line became the administrative boundary between Israel and the occupied territories.231 Following the 1967 war and the Three Nos resolution of the Arab League Israel faced attacks from the Egyptians in the Sinai Peninsula during the 19671970 War of Attrition and from Palestinian groups targeting Israelis in the occupied territories in Israel and around the world. Most important among the various Palestinian and Arab groups was the Palestinian Liberation Organization PLO established in 1964 which initially committed itself to armed struggle as the only way to liberate the homeland.232 In the late 19
60 s and early 19
70 s Palestinian groups launched attacks233234 against Israeli and Jewish targets around the world235 including a massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. The Israeli government responded with an assassination campaign against the organizers of the massacre a bombing and a raid on the PLO headquarters in Lebanon. On 6 October 1973 the Egyptian and Syrian armies launched a surprise attack against Israeli forces in the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights opening the Yom Kippur War. The war ended on 25 October with Israel repelling Egyptian and Syrian forces but having suffered over 2500 soldiers killed in a war which collectively took 1035000 lives in about 20 days.236 An internal inquiry exonerated the government of responsibility for failures before and during the war but public anger forced Prime Minister Golda Meir to resign.2

79.2 40 In return Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over an autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.240 On 11 March 1978 a PLO guerilla raid from Lebanon led to the Coastal Road massacre. Israel responded by launching an invasion of southern Lebanon to destroy PLO bases. Most PLO fighters withdrew but Israel was able to secure southern Lebanon until a UN force and the Lebanese army could take over. The PLO soon resumed its insurgency against Israel. In the next few years the PLO infiltrated the south and kept up a sporadic shelling across the border. Israel carried out numerous retaliatory attacks. Meanwhile Begins government provided incentives for Israelis to settle in the occupied West Bank increasing friction with the Palestinians there.241 The Jerusalem Law 1980 was believed by some to reaffirm Israels 1967 annexation of Jerusalem by government decree and reignited international controversy over the status of the city. No Israeli legislation has defined the territory of Israel and no act specifically included East Jerusalem therein.242 In 1981 Israel effectively annexed the Golan Heights.243 The international community largely rejected these moves with the UN Security Council declaring both the Jerusalem Law and the Golan Heights Law null and void.244245 Several waves of Ethiopian Jews immigrated to Israel since the 19
80 s while between 1990 and 1994 immigration from the postSoviet states increased Israels population by twelve percent.246 On 7 June 1981 during the IranIraq War the Israeli air force destroyed Iraqs sole nuclear reactor under construction just outside Baghdad to impede Iraqs nuclear weapons programme. Following a series of PLO attacks in 1982 Israel invaded Lebanon to destroy the PLO bases.247 In the first six days the Israelis destroyed the military forces of the PLO in Lebanon and decisively defeated the Syrians. An Israeli government inquirythe Kahan Commissionwould later hold Begin and several Israeli generals indirectly responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacre and hold Defense minister Ariel Sharon as bearing personal responsibility.248 Sharon was forced to resign.249 In 1985 Israel responded to a Palestinian terrorist attack in Cyprus by bombing the PLO headquarters in Tunisia. Israel withdrew from most of Lebanon in 1986 but maintained a borderland buffer zone in southern Lebanon until 2000 from where Israeli forces engaged in conflict with Hezbollah. The First Intifada a Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule250 broke out in 1987 with waves of uncoordinated demonstrations and violence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Over the following six years the Intifada became more organized and included economic and cultural measures aimed at disrupting the Israeli occupation. More than a thousand people were killed.251 During the 1991 Gulf War the PLO supported Saddam Hussein and Iraqi missile attacks against Israel. Despite public outrage Israel heeded American calls to refrain from hitting back.252253 Shimon Peres left with Yitzhak Rabin center and King Hussein of Jordan right prior to signing the IsraelJordan peace treaty in 1994 In 1992 Yitzhak Rabin became prime minister following an election in which his party called for compromise with Israels neighbours.254255 The following year Shimon Peres on behalf of Israel and Mahmoud Abbas for the PLO signed the Oslo Accords which gave the Palestinian National Authority PNA the right to govern parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.256 The PLO also recognized Israels right to exist and pledged an end to terrorism.2

It would continue for the next four and a half years. Suicide bombings were a recurrent feature of the Intifada.268 Some commentators contend that the Intifada was preplanned by Arafat due to the collapse of peace talks.269270271272 Sharon became prime minister in a 2001 election he carried out his plan to unilaterally withdraw from the Gaza Strip and spearheaded the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier273 ending the Intifada.274 Between 2000 and 2008 1063 Israelis 5517 Palestinians and 64 foreign citizens had been killed.275 In 2006 a Hezbollah artillery assault on Israels northern border communities and a crossborder abduction of two Israeli soldiers precipitated the monthlong Second Lebanon War.276277 In 2007 the Israeli Air Force destroyed a nuclear reactor in Syria. In 2008 a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel collapsed. The 20082009 Gaza War lasted three weeks and ended after Israel announced a unilateral ceasefire.278279 Hamas announced its own ceasefire with its own conditions of complete withdrawal and opening of border crossings. Despite neither the rocket launchings nor Israeli retaliatory strikes having completely stopped the fragile ceasefire remained.280 In what Israel described as a response to more than a hundred Palestinian rocket attacks on southern Israeli cities281 Israel began an operation in the Gaza Strip in 2012 lasting eight days.282 Israel started another operation in Gaza following an escalation of rocket attacks by Hamas in July 20

10 s the increasing regional cooperation between Israel and Arab League countries have been established culminating in the signing of the Abraham Accords. The Israeli security situation shifted from the traditional ArabIsraeli conflict towards the IranIsrael proxy conflict and direct confrontation with Iran during the Syrian civil war. On 7 October 2023 Palestinian militant groups from Gaza led by Hamas launched a series of coordinated attacks on Israel leading to the start of the 2023 IsraelHamas war.285 On that day approximately 1300 Israelis predominantly civilians were killed in communities near the Gaza Strip border and during a music festival.

The country is at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea bounded by Lebanon to the north Syria to the northeast Jordan and the West Bank to the east and Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the southwest. It lies between latitudes 29 and 34 N and longitudes 34 and 36 E. The sovereign territory of Israel according to the demarcation lines of the 1949 Armistice Agreements and excluding all territories captured by Israel during the 1967 SixDay War is approximately 20770 square kilometers 8019 sq mi of which two percent is water.289 However Israel is so narrow 100 km at its widest compared to 400 km from north to south that the exclusive economic zone in the Mediterranean is double the land area of the country.290 The total area under Israeli law including East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights is 22072 square kilometers 8522 sq mi291 and the total area under Israeli control including the militarycontrolled and partially Palestiniangoverned territory of the West Bank is 27799 square kilometers 10733 sq mi.292 Despite its small size Israel is home to a variety of geographic features from the Negev desert in the south to the inland fertile Jezreel Valley mountain ranges of the Galilee Carmel and toward the Golan in the north. The Israeli coastal plain on the shores of the Mediterranean is home to most of the nations population.293 East of the central highlands lies the Jordan Rift Valley a small part of the 65

The Jordan River runs along the Jordan Rift Valley from Mount Hermon through the Hulah Valley and the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea the lowest point on the surface of the Earth.294 Further south is the Arabah ending with the Gulf of Eilat part of the Red Sea. Makhtesh or erosion cirques are unique to the Negev and the Sinai Peninsula the largest being the Makhtesh Ramon at 38 km in length.295 Israel has the largest number of plant species per square meter of the countries in the Mediterranean Basin.296 Israel contains four terrestrial ecoregions Eastern Mediterranean conifersclerophyllousbroadleaf forests Southern Anatolian montane conifer and deciduous forests Arabian Desert and Mesopotamian shrub desert.297 The forests accounted for 
8.5  of the countrys area in 2016 up from 2 in 1948 as the result of a largescale forest planting program by the Jewish National Fund.298299 Tectonics and seismicity Further information List of earthquakes in the Levant The Jordan Rift Valley is the result of tectonic movements within the Dead Sea Transform DSF fault system. The DSF forms the transform boundary between the African Plate to the west and the Arabian Plate to the east. The Golan Heights and all of Jordan are part of the Arabian Plate while the Galilee West Bank Coastal Plain and Negev along with the Sinai Peninsula are on the African Plate. This tectonic disposition leads to a relatively high seismic activity. The entire Jordan Valley segment is thought to have ruptured repeatedly for instance during the last two major earthquakes along this structure in 749 and 1033. The deficit in slip that has built up since the 1033 event is sufficient to cause an earthquake of Mw

7.4.3 00 The most catastrophic known earthquakes occurred in 31 BCE 363 749 and 1033 CE that is every ca. 400 years on average.301 Destructive earthquakes leading to serious loss of life strike about every 80 years.302 While stringent construction regulations are in place and recently built structures are earthquakesafe as of 20

Temperatures in Israel vary widely especially during the winter. Coastal areas such as those of Tel Aviv and Haifa have a typical Mediterranean climate with cool rainy winters and long hot summers. The area of Beersheba and the Northern Negev have a semiarid climate with hot summers cool winters and fewer rainy days. The Southern Negev and the Arava areas have a desert climate with very hot dry summers and mild winters with few days of rain.

For this reason the flora and fauna are extremely diverse. There are 2867 known species of plants in Israel. Of these at least 253 species are introduced and nonnative.308 There are 380 Israeli nature reserves.309 With scarce water resources Israel has developed various watersaving technologies including drip irrigation.3

The Basic Laws of Israel function as an uncodified constitution. In its Basic Laws Israel defines itself as a Jewish and democratic state and the nationstate of exclusively the Jewish people.320 In 2003 the Knesset began to draft an official constitution based on these laws.289321 Israel has no official religion322323324 but the definition of the state as Jewish and democratic creates a strong connection with Judaism. On 19 July 2018 the Knesset passed a Basic Law that characterizes the State of Israel as principally a Nation State of the Jewish People and Hebrew as its official language. The bill ascribes an undefined special status to the Arabic language.325 The same bill gives Jews a unique right to national selfdetermination and views the developing of Jewish settlement in the country as a national interest empowering the government to take steps to encourage advance and implement this interest.326 Legal system Main articles Judiciary of Israel and Israeli law Supreme Court of Israel Givat Ram Jerusalem Israel has a threetier court system.

The third and highest tier is the Supreme Court located in Jerusalem it serves a dual role as the highest court of appeals and the High Court of Justice. In the latter role the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance allowing individuals both citizens and noncitizens to petition against the decisions of state authorities.327 Israels legal system combines three legal traditions English common law civil law and Jewish law.289 It is based on the principle of stare decisis precedent and is an adversarial system.

Israel also captured the Sinai Peninsula but returned it to Egypt as part of the 1979 EgyptIsrael peace treaty.240 Between 1982 and 2000 Israel occupied part of southern Lebanon in what was known as the Security Belt. Since Israels capture of these territories Israeli settlements and military installations have been built within each of them except Lebanon. The Golan Heights and East Jerusalem have been fully incorporated into Israel under Israeli law but not under international law. Israel has applied civilian law to both areas and granted their inhabitants permanent residency status and the ability to apply for citizenship. The UN Security Council has declared the annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem to be null and void and continues to view the territories as occupied.340341 The status of East Jerusalem in any future peace settlement has at times been a difficult issue in negotiations between Israeli governments and representatives of the Palestinians. Israeli West Bank barrier is a separation barrier built by Israel along the Green Line and inside parts of the West Bank. The West Bank excluding East Jerusalem is known in Israeli law as the Judea and Samaria Area the almost 400000 Israeli settlers residing in the area are considered part of Israels population have Knesset representation and are subject to a large part of Israels civil and criminal laws and their output is considered part of Israels economy.3
42 fn 4 The land itself is not considered part of Israel under Israeli law as Israel has consciously refrained from annexing the territory without ever relinquishing its legal claim to the land or defining a border.342 Israeli political opposition to annexation is primarily due to the perceived demographic threat of incorporating the West Banks Palestinian population into Israel.342 Outside of the Israeli settlements the West Bank remains under direct Israeli military rule and Palestinians in the area cannot become Israeli citizens. The international community maintains that Israel does not have sovereignty in the West Bank and considers Israels control of the area to be the longest military occupation in modern history.345 The West Bank was occupied and annexed by Jordan in 1950 following the 1949 Armistice Agreements. Only Britain recognized this annexation and Jordan has since ceded its claim to the territory to the PLO. The population are mainly Palestinians including refugees of the 1948 ArabIsraeli War.346 From their occupation in 1967 until 1993 the Palestinians living in these territories were under Israeli military administration. Since the IsraelPLO letters of recognition most of the Palestinian population and cities have been under the internal jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority and only partial Israeli military control although Israel has redeployed its troops and reinstated full military administration during periods of unrest. In response to increasing attacks during the Second Intifada the Israeli government started to construct the Israeli West Bank barrier.347 When completed approximately 13 of the barrier will be constructed on the Green Line or in Israel with 87 inside the West Bank.348349 Israels claim of universal suffrage has been questioned due to its blurred territorial boundaries and its simultaneous extension of voting rights to Israeli settlers in the occupied territories and denial of voting rights to their Palestinian neighbours as well as the alleged ethnocratic nature of the state.350351 The Gaza Strip is considered to be a foreign territory under Israeli law Israel along with Egypt operates a land air and sea blockade of the Gaza Strip. The Gaza Strip was occupied by Israel after 1967. In 2005 as part of Israels unilateral disengagement plan Israel removed its settlers and forces from the territory however it continues to maintain control of its airspace and waters. The international community including numerous international humanitarian organizations and bodies of the UN consider Gaza to remain occupied.352353354355356 Following the 2007 Battle of Gaza when Hamas assumed power in the Gaza Strip357 Israel tightened control of the Gaza crossings along its border as well as by sea and air and prevented persons from entering and exiting except for isolated cases it deemed humanitarian.357 Gaza has a border with Egypt and an agreement between Israel the European Union and the PA governed how border crossing would take place.358 The application of democracy to its Palestinian citizens and the selective application of Israeli democracy in the Israelicontrolled Palestinian territories has been criticized.359360 International opinion See also Israeli war crimes and War crimes in the 2023 IsraelHamas war The International Court of Justice said in its 2004 advisory opinion on the legality of the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier that the lands captured by Israel in the SixDay War including East Jerusalem are occupied territory and further found that the construction of the wall within the occupied Palestinian territory to violate international law.361 Most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 242 which emphasizes the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and calls on Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in return for normalization of relations with Arab states Land for peace.362363364 Israel has been criticized for engaging in systematic and widespread violations of human rights in the occupied territories including the occupation itself365 and war crimes against civilians.366367368369 The allegations include violations of international humanitarian law370 by the UN Human Rights Council371 The U.S. State Department has called reports of abuses of significant human rights of Palestinians credible both within Israel372 and the occupied territories.373 Amnesty International and other NGOs have documented mass arbitrary arrests torture unlawful killings systemic abuses and impunity374375376377378379 in tandem with a denial of the right to Palestinian selfdetermination.380381382383384 Prime Minister Netanyahu has defended the countrys security forces for protecting the innocent from terrorists385 and expressed contempt for what he describes as a lack of concern about the human rights violations committed by criminal killers.386 The international community widely regards Israeli settlements in the occupied territories illegal under international law.387 The United Nations however has been accused of bias against Israel.388389 United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 passed 2016 states that Israels settlement activity constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and demands that Israel stop such activity and fulfill its obligations as an occupying power under the Fourth Geneva Convention.390 A United Nations special rapporteur concluded that settlement program was a war crime under the Rome Statute391 and Amnesty International found that the settlement program constitutes an illegal transfer of civilians into occupied territory as well as amounting to pillage which is prohibited by both the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions as well as being a war crime under the Rome Statute.392 Apartheid accusations Main article Israel and apartheid Israels treatment of the Palestinians within the occupied territories have drawn widespread accusations that it is guilty of apartheid a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute and the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid.393394 A 2021 survey of academic experts on the Middle East found an increase from 59 to 65 of these scholars describing Israel as a onestate reality akin to apartheid.395396 This claim has been affirmed by the Israeli human rights organizations Yesh Din and Btselem along with other international human rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch with the criticism extending to its treatment of Palestinians within Israel.397398 Amnestys report was criticised by politicians and representatives from Israel and its closest allies such as the United States399 the United Kingdom400 the European Commission401 Australia402 Netherlands403 and Germany404 while said accusations were welcomed by Palestinians405 representatives from other stateswhich and organizations such as the Arab League.406 In 2022 Michael Lynk a Canadian law professor appointed by the U.N.

2 CID 150208821. The mass immigration from Arab countries began in mid1949 and included three communities that relocated to Israel almost in their entirety 31000 Jews from Libya 50000 from Yemen and 125000 from Iraq. Additional immigrants arrived from Egypt Morocco Tunisia Turkey Iran India and elsewhere. Within three years the Jewish population of Israel doubled. The ethnic composition of the population shifted as well as immigrants from Muslim counties and their offspring now comprised one third of the Jewish populationan unprecedented phenomenon in global immigration history. From 195260 Israel regulated and restricted immigration from Muslim countries with a selective immigration policy based on economic criteria and sent these immigrants most of whom were North African to peripheral Israeli settlements. The selective immigration policy ended in 1961 when following an agreement between Israel and Morocco about 100000 Jews immigrated to the State. From 195268 about 600000 Jews arrived in Israel three quarters of whom were from Arab countries and the remaining immigrants were largely from Eastern Europe. Today fewer than 30000 remain in Muslim countries mostly concentrated in Iran and Turkey.  Fischbach 2008 p. 2627.  a b How Israels electoral system works. CNN.com. CNN International.

Mark Smith in The Early History of God Yahweh and Other Deities of Ancient Israel states Despite the long regnant model that the Canaanites and Israelites were people of fundamentally different culture archaeological data now casts doubt on this view. The material culture of the region exhibits numerous common points between Israelites and Canaanites in the Iron I period c. 12001000 BCE. The record would suggest that the Israelite culture largely overlapped with and derived from Canaanite culture... In short Israelite culture was largely Canaanite in nature. Given the information available one cannot maintain a radical cultural separation between Canaanites and Israelites for the Iron I period. pp. 67.

The ensuing power struggle left Hyrcanus with a free hand in Judea and he quickly reasserted Jewish sovereignty... Hyrcanus then engaged in a series of military campaigns aimed at territorial expansion. He first conquered areas in the Transjordan. He then turned his attention to Samaria which had long separated Judea from the northern Jewish settlements in Lower Galilee. In the south Adora and Marisa were conquered Aristobulus primary accomplishment was annexing and Judaizing the region of Iturea located between the Lebanon and AntiLebanon mountains  BenSasson H.H. 1976.

The main ethnic changes were the work of John Hyrcanus... it was in his days and those of his son Aristobulus that the annexation of Idumea Samaria and Galilee and the consolidation of Jewish settlement in TransJordan was completed.

According to this text considered the most reliable literary source for the Second Jewish Revolt the war encompassed all of Judea the Romans destroyed 985 villages and 50 fortresses and killed 580000 rebels. This article reassesses Cassius Dios figures by drawing on new evidence from excavations and surveys in Judea Transjordan and the Galilee. Three research methods are combined an ethnoarchaeological comparison with the settlement picture in the Ottoman Period comparison with similar settlement studies in the Galilee and an evaluation of settled sites from the Middle Roman Period 70136 CE. The study demonstrates the potential contribution of the archaeological record to this issue and supports the view of Cassius Dios demographic data as a reliable account which he based on contemporaneous documentation.  a b c Mor Menahem 18 April 2016.

But the very claim that the sikarikon laws were annulled for settlement purposes seems to indicate that Jews continued to reside in Judaea even after the Second Revolt. There is no doubt that this area suffered the severest damage from the suppression of the revolt. Settlements in Judaea such as Herodion and Bethar had already been destroyed during the course of the revolt and Jews were expelled from the districts of Gophna Herodion and Aqraba. However it should not be claimed that the region of Judaea was completely destroyed. Jews continued to live in areas such as Lod Lydda south of the Hebron Mountain and the coastal regions. In other areas of the Land of Israel that did not have any direct connection with the Second Revolt no settlement changes can be identified as resulting from it.

The Jewish community strove to recover from the catastrophic results of the Bar Kokhva revolt 132135 CE. Although some of these attempts were relatively successful the Jews never fully recovered. During the Late Roman and Byzantine periods many Jews emigrated to thriving centres in the diaspora especially Iraq whereas some converted to Christianity and others continued to live in the Holy Land especially in Galilee and the coastal plain. During the Byzantine period the three provinces of Palestine included more than thirty cities namely settlements with a bishop see. After the Muslim conquest in the 6
30 s most of these cities declined and eventually disappeared. As a result in many cases the local ecclesiastical administration weakened while in others it simply ceased to exist. Consequently many local Christians converted to Islam. Thus almost twelve centuries later when the army led by Napoleon Bonaparte arrived in the Holy Land most of the local population was Muslim.

The dominant view of the history of Palestine during the Byzantine period links the early phases of the consecration of the land during the fourth century and the substantial external financial investment that accompanied the building of churches on holy sites on the one hand with the Christianisation of the population on the other. Churches were erected primarily at the holy sites 12 while at the same time Palestines position and unique status as the Christian Holy Land became more firmly rooted. All this coupled with immigration and conversion allegedly meant that the Christianisation of Palestine took place much more rapidly than that of other areas of the Roman empire brought in its wake the annihilation of the pagan cults and meant that by the middle of the fifth century there was a clear Christian majority.

5.6  percent of Palestine and was eclipsed by the Arabs in land ownership in every one of Palestines 16 subdistricts.

Although they were of the view that the Jewish national home promised in the Mandate was equivalent to a Jewish state they well understood that such a claim could not be maintained under prevailing international law..Based on its own terms it is impossible to escape the conclusion that the partition plan privileged European interests over those of Palestines indigenous people and as such was an embodiment of the Eurocentricity of the international system that was allegedly a thing of the past. For this reason the Arabs took a more principled position in line with prevailing international law rejecting partition outright . .This rejection has disingenuously been presented in some of the literature as indicative of political intransigence69 and even hostility towards the Jews as Jews  Morris 2008 p. 66 at 1946 The League demanded independence for Palestine as a unitary state with an Arab majority and minority rights for the Jews. p. 67 at 1947 The Leagues Political Committee met in Sofar Lebanon on 1619 September and urged the Palestine Arabs to fight partition which it called aggression without mercy.

The blockade closed Israels sea lane to East Africa and the Far East hindering the development of Israels southern port of Eilat and its hinterland the Nege. Another important objective of the Israeli war plan was the elimination of the terrorist bases in the Gaza Strip from which daily fedayeen incursions into Israel made life unbearable for its southern population. And last but not least the concentration of the Egyptian forces in the Sinai Peninsula armed with the newly acquired weapons from the Soviet bloc prepared for an attack on Israel.

Our hatred is very strong. There is no sense in talking about peace with Israel. There is not even the smallest place for negotiations. Less than two weeks later on October 25 Egypt signed a tripartite agreement with Syria and Jordan placing Nasser in command of all three armies. The continued blockade of the Suez Canal and Gulf of Aqaba to Israeli shipping combined with the increased fedayeen attacks and the bellicosity of recent Arab statements prompted Israel with the backing of Britain and France to attack Egypt on October 29 1956.

ISBN 9781137381156. The compromise therefore was to choose constructive ambiguity as surprising as it may seem there is no law that declares Judaism the official religion of Israel. However there is no other law that declares Israels neutrality toward all confessions. Judaism is not recognized as the official religion of the state and even though the Jewish Muslim and Christian clergy receive their salaries from the state this fact does not make Israel a neutral state. This apparent pluralism cannot dissimulate the fact that Israel displays a clear and undoubtedly hierarchical pluralism in religious matters. ... It is important to note that from a multicultural point of view this selfrestrained secularism allows Muslim law to be practiced in Israel for personal matters of the Muslim community. As surprising as it seems if not paradoxical for a state in war Israel is the only Western democratic country in which Sharia enjoys such an official status.  Sharot Stephen 2007.

Sage Publications. pp. 671672. ISBN 9781412911955. It is true that Jewish Israelis and secular Israelis in particular conceive of religion as shaped by a statesponsored religious establishment. There is no formal state religion in Israel but the state gives its official recognition and financial support to particular religious communities Jewish Islamic and Christian whose religious authorities and courts are empowered to deal with matters of personal status and family law such as marriage divorce and alimony that are binding on all members of the communities.  Jacoby Tami Amanda 2005. Women in Zones of Conflict Power and Resistance in Israel. McGillQueens University Press. pp. 5354. ISBN 9780773529939. Although there is no official religion in Israel there is also no clear separation between religion and state. In Israeli public life tensions frequently arise among different streams of Judaism UltraOrthodox NationalReligious Mesorati Conservative Reconstructionist Progressive Reform and varying combinations of traditionalism and nonobservance. Despite this variety in religious observances in society Orthodox Judaism prevails institutionally over the other streams. This boundary is an historical consequence of the unique evolution of the relationship between Israel nationalism and state building. ... Since the founding period in order to defuse religious tensions the State of Israel has adopted what is known as the status quo an unwritten agreement stipulating that no further changes would be made in the status of religion and that conflict between the observant and nonobservant sectors would be handled circumstantially. The status quo has since pertained to the legal status of both religious and secular Jews in Israel. This situation was designed to appease the religious sector and has been upheld indefinitely through the disproportionate power of religious political parties in all subsequent coalition governments. ... On one hand the Declaration of Independence adopted in 1948 explicitly guarantees freedom of religion. On the other it simultaneously prevents the separation of religion and state in Israel.

93 iconmol021. The real controversy hovering over all the litigation on the security barrier concerns the fate of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. Since 1967 Israel has allowed and even encouraged its citizens to live in the new settlements established in the territories motivated by religious and national sentiments attached to the history of the Jewish nation in the land of Israel. This policy has also been justified in terms of security interests taking into consideration the dangerous geographic circumstances of Israel before 1967 where Israeli areas on the Mediterranean coast were potentially threatened by Jordanian control of the West Bank ridge. The international community for its part has viewed this policy as patently illegal based on the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention that prohibit moving populations to or from territories under occupation.

Citizenship Identity and Political Participation Measuring the Attitudes of the Arab Citizens in Israel Report. Konrad Adenauer Foundation. December 2017. pp. 22 25 28. p.28 The positions of the participants in the focus groups reflect the strength of PalestinianArab identity among Arab citizens and the fact that they do not see a contradiction between PalestinianArab national identity and Israeli civic identity. The designation IsraeliArab aroused great opposition in the focus groups as did Israels Independence Day. A comparison of views expressed in the focus groups with the general results of the survey points to differences between collective positions and memory and individual feelings and attitudes. The collective position presented in the focus group discussions finds expression in the public sphere and emphasizes the Palestinian national identity. Conversely the responses of the survey participants reveal individual attitudes that assign a broader albeit secondary identity dimension to the component of Israeli civic identity quote p.25 Amongst the participants there was consensus that Palestinian identity occupies a central place in their consciousness. The definition Palestinian has national and emotional importance as it embodies the heritage of Arab citizens and their culture. This was expressed explicitly in the words of the participants We are Palestinian Arabs and we say this with prideWe are Palestinian citizens of Israel. The emphasis is on the word Palestinians I am first and foremost a Palestinian and nothing more. The designation Arab citizens of Israel was acceptable to them on the basis of the understanding that it is impossible to live without citizenship and as long as Israeli citizenship does not harm the national consciousness. Conversely the participants spoke out against the designation ArabIsraeli and made statements such as I am an Arab I belong to a larger culture than the State of Israel We are not the Arabs of Israel I am an Arab who does not belong to the State of Israel. My roots and my Arabness existed before them. ArabIsraeli is an inappropriate expression because our ancestors were here before 48.  Lynfield Ben 27 September 2017.
