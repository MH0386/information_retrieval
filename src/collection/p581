5.0  mi north of Giza is the site of Egypts most northerly pyramid also known as the lost pyramid  the mostly ruined Pyramid of Djedefre the son and successor of Khufu. Originally it was thought that this pyramid had never been completed but the currentwhen archaeological consensus is that not only was it completed but that it was built about the same size as the Pyramid of Menkaure  the third largest of the Giza pyramids. It is the location of the northernmost pyramid in Egypt known as Lepsius Number One the pyramid of Djedefre also known as Radjedef and around fifty mastabas located one and a half kilometres from Djedefres pyramid.2 The excavation report on the pyramid complex was published in 20
11.3  Locationedit Abu Rawash Pyramid Boat Pit Its location adjacent to a major crossroads made it an easy source of stone. Quarrying which began in Roman times has left little apart from a few courses of stone superimposed upon the natural hillock that formed part of the pyramids core. Geology of Abu Rawashedit The sedimentary succession in Abu Rawash area ranges in age from Late Cretaceous to Quaternary but is punctuated by several unconformity surfaces. Turonian to Coniacian representing the sedimentary succession of Abu Rawash formation that differentiated into six informal units members from younger to older as follows Basal clastic member Rudistbearing limestonemarl member Limestone member Actaeonellabearing limestonemarl member Flintbearing chalky limestone member Plicatulabearing marllimestone member. Sedimentary depositional environment of Abu Rawash Formation are characterized by variable conditions and settings ranging from lower mixed to upper intertidal flat and subtidal channel for the clastic facies and calm to agitated open marine inner to middle platform for the carbonate facies. Vertical sequence or facies hierarchy display that the facies sequence of the basal clastic member indicates a progradational peritidal sequence. While those of the rudistbearing member and limestone member represent a cyclic progradation of high energeticstorm facies above an open marine low energetic fore shoal subtidal facies. The facies sequence of the Acteonellabearing member reflects two facies associations comprising open marine subtidal assemblage and shoal or bank facies. The latter facies represents the bank that the robust thick shelled Durania arnaudi with the coralline sponge heads accreted local mounds in restricted areas ElHassana dome. The vertical facies hierarchy of the flintbearing chalky limestone member suggests a renewed shoaling of the depositional accommodation shifting to innerplatform setting and a progradation of mobile bioclastic shoals or banks. The stacking of the sedimentary facies in the Plicatulabearing member indicates an accumulation in an open shallow sea inner platform with intermittent supply of fine terrigenous clastics and clays.

There is a large Thinite necropolis at the site and a number of objects bearing the names of HorAha and Den were found in the area.2 A set of radiocarbon data for the reign of Den from the site sets his accession to 30112921 BC 
1.4  Unlike the fourth dynasty mastabas of Giza which sit very close to the pyramids and seem to have been built to a plan in advance the fourth dynasty necropolis at Abu Rawash cemetery F lies some distance from Djedefres pyramid and the mastabas seem to have been built to order and laid out in a more haphazard manner.2 There are also a number of burials dating to the fifth and sixth dynasties and a smaller number dating to the Middle Kingdom.2 Most of the mastabas are composed of external walls made up of large blocks layered around a bedrock core with the upper sections filled in with loose masonry. On the east side there is a cult niche to the north and a Lshaped chapel to the south. Some of the southern chapels have brick annexes to extend them. Many of the tombs are anonymous but some bear the names of their owners and some artifacts have been recovered also bearing these names for example an alabaster offering table dedicated to Hornit.2 See alsoedit List of ancient Egyptian towns and cities List of ancient Egyptian sites List of megalithic sites Referencesedit  Czarkiewicz Andrzej 1971.
