23 rd Dynasty Usermaatre Setepenamun Osorkon III SiEse was Pharaoh of Egypt in the 
8 th Century BC. He is the same person as the Crown Prince and High Priest of Amun Osorkon B son of Takelot II by his Great Royal Wife Karomama II. Prince Osorkon B is best attested by his Chroniclewhich consists of a series of texts documenting his activities at Thebeson the Bubastite Portal at Karnak.2 He later reigned as king Osorkon III in Upper Egypt for twentyeight years after defeating the rival forces of Pedubast IShoshenq VI who had apparently resisted the authority of his father here. Osorkon ruled the last five years of his reign in coregency with his son Takelot III according to Karnak Nile Level Text No. 
13.3  Osorkon IIIs formal titulary was long and elaborate Usermaatre Setepenamun Osorkon SiEse Meryamun NetjerHeqawaset.4 Accessionedit Osorkon IIIs precise accession date is unknown. Various Egyptologists have suggested it may have been from around the mid7
90 s BC to as late as 787 BC.5 The issue is complicated by the fact that Prince Osorkon B did not immediately declare himself king after his successful conquest of Thebes and defeat of Shoshenq VI. This is evidenced by the fact that he dated this seminal event to Year 39 of Shoshenq III rather than Year 1 of his reign. Osorkon III may therefore have waited for a minimum of one or two years before proclaiming himself as a Pharaoh of the Thebanbased 
23 rd Dynasty. Osorkon may also have been motivated to defeat or pacify any remaining supporters of the Pedubast IShoshenq VI rival faction in other regions of Upper Egypt whether they were in Elephantine the Western Desert Oasis regionwhere Pedubast I is monumentally attestedor elsewhere in order to consolidate his position. Hence Year 1 of Osorkon III is likely equivalent to Year 1 or Year 2 of Shoshenq IV instead rather than Year 39 of Shoshenq III. Identityedit A relief depicting Osorkon in his early career when he was the High Priest of Amun during the reign of his father Takelot II. The relief also bears his ancestry as a son of queen Karomama II daughter of Nimlot C son of Osorkon II. Osorkon III is attested by numerous impressive donation stelae and stone blocks from Herakleopolis Magna through to Thebes. He is generally thought to have been a contemporary of the Lower Egyptian 
22 nd Dynasty kings Shoshenq IV Pami and the first decade of Shoshenq Vs reign. Osorkon IIIs chief wife was Queen Karoadjet but his second wife was named Tentsai. A stela of Prince Osorkon B calls his spouse Tent... with part of the name being lost. The latter name can be rendered as either Tentsai or Tentamun. Significantly however both men have a daughter called Shepenupet. Secondly according to hshiro Michinori6 Anthony Leahy7 and Karl JansenWinkeln8 an important donation stela9 discovered in 1982 at ihn alabal ancient Akoris reveals that Osorkon III was once a High Priest of Amun in his own right. The document explicitly calls Osorkon III the High Priest of Amun. Osorkon III thus was almost certainly the High Priest Osorkon B who defeated his fathers opponents at Thebes in Year 39 of Shoshenq III as Leahy notes. This theory has now been accepted by many Egyptologists including Jrgen von Beckerath10 Karl JansenWinkeln11 Gerard Broekman12 and Aidan Dodson among others with the notable exception of Kenneth Kitchen.13 Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton sum up the evidence by noting That Osorkon B is the same person as King Osorkon III is indicated by the fact that the formers last appearance as High Priest of Amun seems to directly precede Osorkon IIIs assumption of the throne reinforcing a stela from Tehna which mentions the latter with the additional title of High Priestan unusual occurrence.14 Osorkon probably lived into his eighties which explains why he appointed his son Takelot III as the junior coregent to the throne in his final years. He would have been in failing health by this time. Osorkon IIIs coregency with Takelot III is the last attested royal coregency in ancient Egyptian history. Later dynasties from Nubia Sais and Persia all ruled Egypt with a single king on the throne. Karnak Nile Level Texts No. 6 and 715 dated to Year 5 and 6 of Osorkon III calls his mother the Chief Queen Kamama Merymut.16 Similarly Prince Osorkon Bs mother was identified as Queen Karamama Merymut II wife of Takelot II.17 The slightly different renderings of this Queens name almost certainly refers to the same person here Osorkon BIII. Consortsedit According to Kenneth Kitchen Osorkon IIIs chief consort Queen Karoadjet was the mother of Shepenupet I the Gods Wife and Divine Adoratrice of Amun while his lesser wife Tentsai was the mother of Osorkon IIIs two sons Takelot III and Rudamun.18 Shepenupet I outlived both her halfbrothers as the serving Gods Wife of Amun at Thebes and survived into the reign of the Nubian ruler Shebitku where she is depicted on the small temple OsirisHeqadjet in the Amun precinct of Karnak which was partially decorated by this king.
