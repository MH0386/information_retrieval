Reignedit Takelot I was the son of Osorkon I and Queen Tashedkhons who ruled Egypt for thirteen years according to Manetho. Takelot married Queen Kapes who bore him Osorkon II. Initially Takelot was believed to be an ephemeral 
22 nd Dynasty Pharaoh since no monuments at Tanis or Lower Egypt could be conclusively linked to his reign  or even mentioned his existence except for the famous Stela of Pasenhor which dates to Year 37 of Shoshenq V. However since the late 19
80 s Egyptologists have assigned several documents mentioning a king Takelot in Lower Egypt to this newlydiscovered Takelot now Takelot I rather than the previouslyknown Takelot now to be called Takelot II. Takelot Is reign was relatively short when compared to the 30 year reigns of his father Osorkon I and son Osorkon II. Takelot I rather than Takelot II was the king Hedjkheperre Setepenre Takelot who is attested by a Year 9 stela from Bubastis as well as the owner of a partly robbed Royal Tomb at Tanis as the German Egyptologist Karl JansenWinkeln reported in a 1987 Varia Aegyptiaca 3 1987 pp. 253258 paper.1 Evidently both king Takelots used the same royal prenomen Hedjkheperre Setepenre. The main difference between Takelot I and II is that Takelot I never employed the Thebaninspired epithet SiEse Son of Isis in his titulary unlike Takelot II.2 As Kenneth Kitchen writes in the third 1996 edition of his book on The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt It was Takeloth I who first used the prenomen Hedjkheperre Setepenre in imitation of his grandfather Shoshenq I being followed in this practise by Takeloth II. The only clear distinction... between Takeloth I and II as both use the epithet Meriamun is that Takeloth II uses also the epithet SiEse Son of Isis in his second cartouche. A second marker suggested by JansenWinkeln with some reserve is that Takeloth I has his name spelt with the vertical tsign Gardiner U33 ti becoming t while both Takeloth II and III use the small loaf tsign X 1 and the ropetether sign V 13. This criterion...seems sound. This would suggest attributing to Takeloth I not II a donationstela of Year 9 from Bubastis another in Berlin also from Bubastis and a fragment in the former Grant collection. This also bears on the high priests of Ptah at Memphis and the Serapeum. There a block is known bearing the name of a high priest Merenptah and a pair of cartouches hitherto attributed to Takeloth II which in fact correspond precisely to those now attributable to Takeloth I no SiEse tall t. Therefore it seems proper to move this priest back in time to the reign of Takeloth I.2 Tombedit The evidence that the royal Tanite tomb belonged to Takelot I was suggested long ago by the presence of grave goods found within the burial which mentioned his known parents namely a Gold Bracelet Cairo JE 72199 and an alabaster Jar Cairo JE 86962 of Osorkon I and an Ushabti figure of Queen Tashedkhons.3 In addition a heart scarab found in the kings burial gave his name simply as Takelot Meryamun without the SiEse epithet used by Takelot II. Recent confirmation of this circumstantial evidence was published by the German scholar JansenWinkeln in 19
87.4  His examination of several inscriptions written on the tombs walls proved beyond doubt that the person buried here could only be Takelot I Osorkon IIs father. JansenWinkelns conclusions have been accepted by many modern Egyptologists including Professor Kenneth Kitchen. Osorkon II arranged for this aforementioned inscription to be carved on a scene in his tomb where Osorkon is depicted adoring Osiris and Udjo as a uraeus. Made by the King of the South  North Egypt Lord of Both Lands Usimare Setepenamun Son of Re Lord of Crowns Osorkon II Meryamun to furbish the Osiris i.e. deceased King Takelot Meryamun in his Mansion which is an abode of the Sundisc I have caused him to rest in this Mansion in the vicinity of Hiddenof Name Amun according to the doing by a son of benefactions for his father to furbish the one who has made his fortune in conformity with that Horus SonofIsis commanded for his father Wennufer. How pleasant it is in my heart for the Lord of the Gods Above the inscription was carved the cartouche of Osorkon II and the following text A Son furbishing the one who created i.e. begot him.5 This text establishes that Osorkon II honoured his father by reburying him in the Tanite royal tomb complex. Takelot Is final resting place forms the third chamber of Osorkon IIs tomb which means that Osorkon II interred his father within the walls of his own tomb. Takelot I was buried in a usurped Middle Kingdom sarcophagus that was inscribed with his own cartouche.6 Authorityedit Takelot Is authority was not fully recognised in Upper Egypt and Harsiese A or another local Theban king challenged his power there. Several Nile Level Texts at Thebes mention two sons of Osorkon Inamely the High Priests of Amun Iuwelot and Smendes III in Years 5 8 and 14 of an anonymous king who can only be Takelot I since Takelot I was their brother.7 Uniquely however the Quay Texts specifically omit any reference to the identity of the king himself. This might suggest that there was a dispute in the royal succession following Osorkon Is death in Upper Egypt which seriously impaired Takelot Is control there. Harsiese A as the son of the High Priest Shoshenq C and grandson of Osorkon I or a hypothetical king named Maatkheperre Shoshenq must have appeared as a rival. The Theban priests henceforth chose to avoid any involvement in this dispute by deliberately leaving the name of the king in the Quay Texts Blank rather than choosing sides as G. Broekman notes in his study of the Karnak Quay Texts.8 This situation was ultimately later resolved by Osorkon II who is clearly attested as Pharaoh at Thebes by his
