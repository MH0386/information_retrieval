20 th Dynasty of Egypt and one of the sons of Ramesses III1 and Iset TaHemdjert. He was thus a brother of Ramesses IV Ramesses VI Ramesses VIII and an uncle of Ramesses V and Ramesses VII. He was the First Charioteer of His Majesty2 and married the queen Takhat who bears the prominent title of Kings Mother. This development supports the hypothesis that they are most probably the parents of king Ramesses IX since no other Ramesside king had a mother by this name3 also Ramesses IX had a son named Montuherkhepeshef. Montuherkhepeshef is shown in the procession of princes in the Medinet Habu temple of Ramesses III. He is likely to be identical with the Prince Montuherkhepeshef buried in the tomb KV13 in the Valley of the Kings.4 He never became Pharaoh unlike his son Ramses IX or even crown prince because he died not only before his brother Ramses VIII but also before his nephew Ramses VII.5 Referencesedit  Aidan Dodson  Dyan Hilton The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt Thames  Hudson 2004 ISBN 0500051283 p.193  K.
