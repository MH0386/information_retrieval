3 r3 Lord of the Ka of R Turin King List Nebka... Nbk3 Lord of the ka Dynasty Third Dynasty Nebka meaning Lord of the ka is the throne name of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the Third Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period in the 
27 th century BCE. He is thought to be identical with the Hellenized name  Necherchis or Necherphes recorded by the Egyptian priest Manetho of the much later Ptolemaic period. Nebkas name is otherwise recorded from the near contemporaneous tomb of a priest of his cult as well as in a possible cartouche from Beit Khallaf later New Kingdom king lists and in a story of the Westcar Papyrus. If the Beit Khallaf seal impression is indeed a cartouche of Nebka then he is the earliest king to have thus recorded his throne name otherwise this innovation can be ascribed to Huni. Nebka is thought by most Egyptologists to be the throne name of Sanakht the third or fourth ruler of the Third Dynasty who is sparsely attested by archaeological evidence and must have had only a short reign. Older hypotheses followed two New Kingdom sources which credit Nebka with founding the Third Dynasty a view that is now believed to contradict the archaeological evidence. The tomb of Nebka has not been located with any certainty and three locations have been proposed a mastaba in Beit Khallaf attributed to Sanakht by John Garstang a mudbrick structure in Abu Rawash seen as the tomb of Nebka by Swelim and Dodson and the Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet El Aryan. Name sourcesedit The earliest source for Nebkas name is the mastaba tomb of the late Third Dynasty high official Akhetaa who among other positions held that of priest of Nebka.456 The exact location of Akhetaas mastaba is now lost hindering further research. It may be near Abusir where some reliefbearing blocks from the tomb were found reused as construction material.7 The next oldest source is found in a story recorded on the Westcar Papyrus which dates to the Seventeenth Dynasty but which was likely first written during the late Middle Kingdom period8 possibly at the end of the Twelfth Dynasty.9 There a king Nebka is cited in the story known as Nebka and the crocodile which pertains to adultery and the typical sort of punishment for that during the Old Kingdom. The story throws a positive light on the personality of king Nebka who is depicted as a strict but lawful judge. He punishes mischief and unethical behavior in this case punishing the betrayal of an unfaithful wife with the death penalty.1011 The passage involving Nebka starts after a magician Ubaoner throws a commoner who had an affair with Ubaoners wife to a crocodile who swallows him for seven days During these seven days Ubaoner is received by pharaoh Nebka for an important audience. After the audience Ubaoner invites Nebka to visit his house with the words May thy majesty proceed and see the wonder that has happened in the time of thy majesty ... text damaged ... a commoner. Nebka and Ubaoner walk to the lake where Ubaoner orders the crocodile to come out of the water and to release the commoner. When king Nebka sees that he says This crocodile is dangerous But Ubaoner bends down and touches the crocodile and immediately it becomes a figurine of wax again. Then Ubaoner gives a report to Nebka about the affairs. Nebka tells the crocodile Take away what is yours and the animal grabs the commoner and then disappears. The wife of Ubaoner is brought to Nebka too and the pharaoh sentences her to death. She is brought to a place east of the palace and burnt alive. Her ash is thrown into the Nile.101211 The subsequent historical sources date to the Nineteenth Dynasty the Royal Table of Saqqara mentions a Nebkara close to the end of the Third Dynasty as the direct successor of Sekhemket and predecessor of Huni. This Nebkara is likely a variant of the name Nebka.131415 The near contemporaneous Abydos King list and Turin canon record a king Nebka this time as the founder of the Third Dynasty.16 Finally a king Necherchis is listed as the founder of the Third Dynasty in the Aegyptiaca a history of Egypt written in the 
3 rd century BCE during the reign of Ptolemy II 283246 BCE by an Egyptian priest Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius themselves quoted by the Byzantine scholar George Syncellus. According to these sources the Aegyptiaca gave Necherchis as the predecessor of Sesorthos or Tosorthros both names being widely held to refer to Djoser as the Aegyptiaca credits Sesorthos with the invention of stone architecture. Necherchis Eusebius or Necherphes Africanus both likely Hellenized forms of Nebka is said to have faced a rebellion of Libyans during his reign but when the moon waxed beyond reckoning they surrendered in terror.17 Africanus further credits Necherphes with 28 years of reign.18 Identityedit Seal impression from Beit Khallaf showing Sanakhts serekh together with what could be a cartouche of Nebka.19 Nebkas identity with respect to other Third Dynasty rulers is now partially settled. Most scholars including Thomas Schneider2 Darell Baker20 Peter Clayton21 Michel Baud22 Jaromr Mlek23 Toby Wilkinson24 Kenneth Anderson Kitchen15 Stephan Seidlmayer25 Michael Rice26 Donald Leprohon3 and Rainer Stadelmann are convinced that Nebka was identical with HorSanakht. This opinion is based on a single fragmentary clay seal discovered by Garstand in 1902 in Beit Khallaf2728 a locality north of Abydos.22 Kurt Sethe proposed that the damaged sealing shows the serekh of Sanakht next to a fragmentary cartouche housing an archaic form of the sign for ka.29 The cartouche is believed to be just large enough to have enclosed the further sign Neb.28 In addition a further two dozen sealings of Sanakht were uncovered in Beit Khallafs nearby tomb K228301 which John Garstang believed to be this kings tomb.2728 If the identification of Nebka with Sanakht is correct then Nebka is the earliest king to write his throne name in a cartouche and otherwise this innovation would pass to Huni.31 Egyptologists John D. Degreef Nabil Swelim and Wolfgang Helck resisted the equation of Nebka with Sanakht in earlier research. They underline the heavily damaged nature of the Beit Khallaf seal fragment and hence that the alleged cartouche can be hardly identified with certainty. Instead they propose that the cartouche could actually be the ovalshaped crest of a royal fortress with one or several boats in it a city that may have already been mentioned under the name Elders boats in sources dating to the Second Dynasty king Peribsen.21432 Chronologyedit Relief fragment of Sanakht from Sinai Nebkas relative chronological position has been the subject of debate in earlier Egyptology as he is listed as the first pharaoh of the Third Dynasty in both the Turin third column seventh line and Abydos 
15 th entry king lists.20 Some Egyptologists including Mlek tried to reconcile this position in the list with the evidence from Beit Khallaf by proposing that Nebka Sanakht reigned for a short time between the last Second Dynasty ruler Khasekhemwy and Djoser whom Mlek sees as a younger brother to Sanakht.33 This is now understood to flatly contradict quoting Wilkinson much archaeological evidence3435 which rather point to Djoser as the first ruler of the dynasty and Sekhemket as his immediate successor. For example numerous seal fragments of Djoser uncovered in the tomb of Khasekhemwy strongly suggest that he buried this king who might have been his father. Khasekhemwys wife and likely Djosers mother queen Nimaethap was herself buried in tomb K1 of Beit Khallaf which yielded many seals of Djoser but none of Sanakht.28 Nimaethap was furthermore given the title of Mother of a king that is with a singular implying that she had only one son who ascended the throne precluding the reign of Sanakht between those of Khasekhemwy and Djoser. Kitchen also observes that the Turin Canon gives exactly the same reign length of 19 years to both Nebka and Djoser hinting at an error in the placement of Nebkas name on the canon and the attribution of Djosers regnal years to Nebka.2143236 In addition the Saqqara king list places Nebka after Sekhemket rather than before Djoser.20 Further indirect evidence for Nebkas placement in the late Third Dynasty comes from the Papyrus Westcar which records the story of Nebka and the crocodile between two tales set in the reigns of Djoser and Huni and Sneferu respectively.37 Evidence from the tomb of Akhetaa regarding the chronological position of Nebka is inconclusive on the one hand Akhetaas title could indicate that he was priest of the cult of the reigning king and thus that Nebka was alive at the end of the Third Dynasty. On the other hand it could equally be that Akhetaa was priest of a funerary cult in which case Nebkas placement could be somewhat earlier.34 Given the likely identification of Nebka with Sanakht and the placement of the later in the late Third Dynasty perhaps as the penultimate king of this line it is possible that Nebka Sanakht reigned for six years. This is the duration credited by the Turin canon to the immediate predecessor of Huni whose name is lost1 and in any case a short reign better fits the scant archaeological evidence for both Nebka and Sanakht.1316 Tombedit Skull uncovered in Beit Khallaf tomb K2 attributed to Sanakht by Garstang.38 The bones found in K2 exhibit gigantism as the individual was over 
1.8 7 m 6 ft 112 in tall. The tomb of Nebka has not been located with any certainty nor has that of Sanakht. Garstang who excavated mastaba K2 at Beit Khallaf believed that it belonged to Sanakht as seals bearing this pharaohs name were uncovered there beside a burial.2738 Dieter Arnold and other Egyptologists now think mastaba K2 was the tomb of a private individual rather than a royal one39 though the old theory is still supported. Swelim and Aidan Dodson have instead proposed that a mudbrick structure located in Abu Rawash could be the tomb of Nebka. Dodson states that it is a mudbrick enclosure 330 m  170 m 1080 ft  560 ft with a 20 m 66 ft central square massif of the same material located north of the modern village of Abu Roash known as El Dair. It has been badly damaged by drainage work since first being discovered in 1902 and now may be beyond saving. However the plan seems to closely resemble royal funerary monuments of the late Second and early Third Dynasties while pottery from the site has been dated to the latter period.40 Stone sarcophagus from the unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet El Aryan. On the other hand some Egyptologists have noticed that Nebkas name seems to be inscribed in the Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet El Aryan under the form Nebkara so that this structure could have been started by this king. More precisely they point to several graffiti made of black and red ink which were found in the chamber and in the descending stairway of the pyramid. Alessandro Barsanti recorded at least 67 inscriptions with the names of different workmen crews as well as the name of the planned pyramid complex Seba Ka meaning The Star of Ka. The workmen crew whose name appears most often  thus being the leading crew during the building works  was Werefseba Ka meaning Great Like the Star of King Ka. Inscription No. 35 gives the name NeferkaNefer meaning His Beautiful Ka is Flawless but otherwise lacks any reference to known people from the Third or Fourth Dynasty to which this pyramid is usually ascribed. Graffiti No. 15 and No. 52 mention the royal name Nebkar meaning Lord of the Ka of R and a further inscription No. 55 mentions a possible Horus of Gold name Neb hedjetnwb meaning Lord of the Golden Crown. Some Egyptologists propose that this is either the Horus name of king Huni or the Horus of Gold name of Nebka.414243 References and sourcesedit Referencesedit  a b c d Wilkinson 1999 p. 102.  a b c d Schneider 2002 pp. 167  243.  a b c Leprohon 2013 p. 33.
