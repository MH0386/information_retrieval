It lies at the western edge of the Nile River delta. Founded in c.331 BC by Alexander the Great9 Alexandria grew rapidly and became a major centre of Hellenic civilization eventually replacing Memphis in presentday Greater Cairo as Egypts capital. Called the Bride of the Mediterranean internationally10 Alexandria is a popular tourist destination and an important industrial centre due to its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez. The city extends about 40 km 25 mi along the northern coast of Egypt and is the largest city on the Mediterranean the secondlargest in Egypt after Cairo the fourthlargest city in the Arab world the ninthlargest city in Africa and the ninthlargest urban area in Africa. The city was founded originally in the vicinity of an Egyptian settlement named Rhacotis that became the Egyptian quarter of the city. Alexandria grew rapidly becoming a major centre of Hellenic civilisation and replacing Memphis as Egypts capital during the reign of the Ptolemaic pharaohs who succeeded Alexander. It retained this status for almost a millennium through the period of Roman and Eastern Roman rule until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 AD when a new capital was founded at Fustat later absorbed into Cairo. Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria Pharos one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World its Great Library the largest in the ancient world and the Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages. Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural centre of the ancient Mediterranean for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity.9 It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome. The city was a major centre of early Christianity and was the centre of the Patriarchate of Alexandria which was one of the major centres of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire. In the modern world the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage. By 641 the city had already been largely plundered and lost its significance before reemerging in the modern era.11 From the late 
18 th century Alexandria became a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean and Red Seas and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton. Historyedit Main article History of Alexandria For a chronological guide see Timeline of Alexandria. Ancient eraedit Radiocarbon dating of seashell fragments and lead contamination show human activity at the location during the period of the Old Kingdom 
27 th
21 st centuries BC and again in the period 1000800 BC followed by the absence of activity after that.12 From ancient sources it is known there existed a trading post at this location during the time of Rameses the Great for trade with Crete but it had long been lost by the time of Alexanders arrival.9 A small Egyptian fishing village named Rhakotis Egyptian rqdy.t That which is built up existed since the 
13 th century BC in the vicinity and eventually grew into the Egyptian quarter of the city.9 Just east of Alexandria where Abu Qir Bay is now there were in ancient times marshland and several islands. As early as the 
7 th century BC there existed important port cities of Canopus and Heracleion. The latter was recently rediscovered underwater. Alexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in April 331 BC as  Alexandreia as one of his many city foundations. After he captured the Egyptian Satrapy from the Persians Alexander wanted to build a large Greek city on Egypts coast that would bear his name. He chose the site of Alexandria envisioning the building of a causeway to the nearby island of Pharos that would generate two great natural harbours.9 Alexandria was intended to supersede the older Greek colony of Naucratis as a Hellenistic centre in Egypt and to be the link between Greece and the rich Nile valley. A few months after the foundation Alexander left Egypt and never returned to the city during his life. Plan of Alexandria c.30 BC After Alexanders departure his viceroy Cleomenes continued the expansion. The architect Dinocrates of Rhodes designed the city using a Hippodamian grid plan. Following Alexanders death in 323 BC his general Ptolemy Lagides took possession of Egypt and brought Alexanders body to Egypt with him.13 Ptolemy at first ruled from the old Egyptian capital of Memphis. In 322321 BC he had Cleomenes executed. Finally in 305 BC Ptolemy declared himself Pharaoh as Ptolemy I Soter Savior and moved his capital to Alexandria. rqdyt Alexandria1415 in hieroglyphs Although Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandrias early development the Heptastadion and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined Tyre and becoming the centre of the new commerce between Europe and the Arabian and Indian East the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than Carthage. In one century Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and for some centuries more was second only to Rome. It became Egypts main Greek city with Greek people from diverse backgrounds.16 The Septuagint a Greek version of the Tanakh was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept it in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic centre of learning Library of Alexandria which faced destruction during Caesars siege of Alexandria in 47 BC but were careful to maintain the distinction of its populations three largest ethnicities Greek Egyptian and Jewish.17 By the time of Augustus the city grid encompassed an area of 10 km2 
3.9  sq mi18 and the total population during the Roman principate was around 500000600000 which would wax and wane in the course of the next four centuries under Roman rule.19 According to Philo of Alexandria in the year 38 AD disturbances erupted between Jews and Greek citizens of Alexandria during a visit paid by King Agrippa I to Alexandria principally over the respect paid by the Herodian nation to the Roman emperor which quickly escalated to open affronts and violence between the two ethnic groups and the desecration of Alexandrian synagogues. This event has been called the Alexandrian pogroms. The violence was quelled after Caligula intervened and had the Roman governor Flaccus removed from the city.20 The Lighthouse of Alexandria on coins minted in Alexandria in the second century 1 reverse of a coin of Antoninus Pius and 2 reverse of a coin of Commodus In 115 AD large parts of Alexandria were destroyed during the Kitos War which gave Hadrian and his architect Decriannus an opportunity to rebuild it. In 215 AD the emperor Caracalla visited the city and because of some insulting satires that the inhabitants had directed at him abruptly commanded his troops to put to death all youths capable of bearing arms. On 21 July 365 AD Alexandria was devastated by a tsunami 365 Crete earthquake21 an event annually commemorated years later as a day of horror.22 Islamic eraedit In 619 Alexandria fell to the Sassanid Persians. The city was mostly uninjured by the conquest and a new palace called Tarawus was erected in the eastern part of the city later known as Qasr Faris fort of the Persians.23 Although the Byzantine emperor Heraclius recovered it in 629 in 641 the Arabs under the general Amr ibn alAs invaded it during the Muslim conquest of Egypt after a siege that lasted 14 months. The first Arab governor of Egypt recorded to have visited Alexandria was Utba ibn Abi Sufyan who strengthened the Arab presence and built a governors palace in the city in 6646
65.2 425 In reference to Alexandria Ibn Battuta speaks of a number of Muslim saints that resided in the city. One such saint was Imam Borhan Oddin El Aaraj who was said to perform miracles. Another notable figure was Yaqut alArshi a disciple of Abu Abbas El Mursi.2627 Ibn Battuta also writes about Abu Abdallah alMurshidi a saint that lived in the Minyat of Ibn Murshed. Although alMurshidi lived in seclusion Ibn Battuta writes that he was regularly visited by crowds high state officials and even by the Sultan of Egypt at the time alNasir Muhammad.26 Ibn Battuta also visited the Pharos lighthouse on two occasions in 1326 he found it to be partly in ruins and in 1349 it had deteriorated to the point that it was no longer possible to enter.28 Alexandria in the late 
18 th century by Luigi Mayer During the Middle Ages the Mamluk Sultanate provided amenities for European merchants to stay in the port cities of Alexandria and Damietta so hotels were built and placed at the merchants disposal so that they could live according to the pattern they were accustomed to in their country. Alexandria lost much of its importance in international trade after Portuguese navigators discovered a new sea route to India in the late 
15 th century. This reduced the amount of goods that needed to be transported through the Alexandrian port as well as the Mamluks political power.29 After the Battle of Ridaniya in 1517 the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and remained under Ottoman rule until 1798. Alexandria lost much of its former importance to the Egyptian port city of Rosetta during the 
9 th to 
18 th centuries and it only regained its former prominence with the construction of the Mahmoudiyah Canal in 1820.citation needed Map of the city in the 17
80 s by LouisFranois Cassas Alexandria figured prominently in the military operations of Napoleons expedition to Egypt in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798 and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801 following which they besieged the city which fell to them on 2 September 1801. Muhammad Ali the Ottoman governor of Egypt began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810 and by 1850 Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory.30 Egypt turned to Europe in their effort to modernize the country. Greeks followed by other Europeans and others began moving to the city. In the early 
20 th century the city became a home for novelists and poets.11 Bombardment of Alexandria by British naval forces 1882 In July 1882 the city came under bombardment from British naval forces and was occupied.31 In July 1954 the city was a target of an Israeli bombing campaign that later became known as the Lavon Affair. On 26 October 1954 Alexandrias Mansheya Square was the site of a failed assassination attempt on Gamal Abdel Nasser.32 Europeans began leaving Alexandria following the 1956 Suez Crisis that led to an outburst of Arab nationalism. The nationalization of property by Nasser which reached its highest point in 1961 drove out nearly all the rest.11 Geographyedit Lake Mariout Alexandria is located in the country of Egypt on the southern coast of the Mediterranean. It is in the Far West Nile delta area.33 Its a densely populated city its core areas belie its large administrative area.

Kisms are considered fully urbanized34 Climateedit Alexandria has a hot steppe climate Kppen climate classification BSh35 formerly hot desert climate Kppen climate classification BWh.36 Like the rest of Egypts northern coast the prevailing north wind blowing across the Mediterranean gives the city a less severe climate than the desert hinterland.37 Rafah and Alexandria38 are the wettest places in Egypt the other wettest places are Rosetta Baltim Kafr elDawwar and Mersa Matruh. The citys climate is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea moderating its temperatures causing variable rainy winters and moderately hot and slightly prolonged summers that at times can be very humid January and February are the coolest months with daily maximum temperatures typically ranging from 12 to 18 C 54 to 64 F and minimum temperatures that could reach 5 C 41 F. Alexandria experiences violent storms rain and sometimes sleet and hail during the cooler months these events combined with a poor drainage system have been responsible for occasional flooding in the city in the past though they rarely occur anymore.39 July and August are the hottest and driest months of the year with an average daily maximum temperature of 30 C 86 F.

30.5 1 The 2022 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report estimates that by 2050 Alexandria and 11 other major African cities Abidjan Algiers Cape Town Casablanca Dakar Dar es Salaam Durban Lagos Lom Luanda and Maputo would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US65 billion for the moderate climate change scenario RCP

86.5  billion for the highemission scenario RCP 
8.5  while RCP 
8.5  combined with the hypothetical impact from marine ice sheet instability at high levels of warming would involve up to US1

4.5  US206 billion for RCP
8.5  and US397 billion under the highend ice sheet instability scenario. In every single estimate Alexandria alone bears around half of these costs.52 Since sea level rise would continue for about 10000 years under every scenario of climate change future costs of sea level rise would only increase especially without adaptation measures.53 Ancient layoutedit Macedonian Army shown on the Alexander Sarcophagus This section needs additional citations for verification.

It was occupied chiefly by Egyptians. Brucheum Brucheum was the Royal or Greek quarter and formed the most magnificent portion of the city. In Roman times Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets each of which had an attendant subterranean canal. Jewish quarter The Jewish quarter was the northeast portion of the city. Engraving by L. F. Cassas of the Canopic Street in Alexandria Egypt made in 1784 Two main streets lined with colonnades and said to have been each about 60 m 200 ft wide intersected in the centre of the city close to the point where the Sema or Soma of Alexander his Mausoleum rose. This point is very near the present mosque of Nebi Daniel the line of the great EastWest Canopic street is also present in modernday Alexandria having only slightly diverged from the line of the modern Boulevard de Rosette now Sharae Fouad. Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications which lie well within the area of the ancient city. One of the pair of Cleopatras Needles in Alexandria which were relocated to London and New York in the late 
19 th century Alexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos which was joined to the mainland by a 1260 mlong 4130 ft mole and called the Heptastadion seven stadiaa stadium was a Greek unit of length measuring approximately 180 m or 590 ft. The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square where the Moon Gate rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern Ras alTin quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras alTin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbour now an open bay on the west lay the port of Eunostos with its inner basin Kibotos now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbour. In Strabos time latter half of the 
1 st century BC the principal buildings were as follows enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbour. The Royal Palaces filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias which shut in the Great Harbour on the east. Lochias the modern Pharillon has almost entirely disappeared into the sea together with the palaces the Private Port and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land subsidence here as throughout the northeast coast of Africa. The Great Theater on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by Julius Caesar as a fortress where he withstood a siege from the city mob after he took Egypt after the battle of Pharsalus.citation neededclarification needed The Poseidon or Temple of the Sea God close to the theater The Timonium built by Marc Antony54 The Emporium Exchange The Apostases Magazines The Navalia Docks lying west of the Timonium along the seafront as far as the mole Behind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum by which stood the two great obelisks which became known as Cleopatras Needles and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became in time the Patriarchal Church though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum the parts not eroded by the waves lies under the houses lining the new seawall. The Gymnasium and the Palaestra are both inland near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town sites unknown. The Temple of Saturn site unknown. The Mausolea of Alexander Soma and the Ptolemies in one ringfence near the point of intersection of the two main streets. The Musaeum with its famous Library and theater in the same region site unknown. The Serapeum of Alexandria the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells that this stood in the west of the city and recent discoveries go far as to place it near Pompeys Pillar which was an independent monument erected to commemorate Diocletians siege of the city. The names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known but there is little information as to their actual position. None however are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There The Great Lighthouse one of the Seven Wonders of the World reputed to be 138 m 453 ft high was situated. The first Ptolemy began the project and the second Ptolemy Ptolemy II Philadelphus completed it at a total cost of 800 talents. It took 12 years to complete and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 
14 th century making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder after the Great Pyramid of Giza. A temple of Hephaestus also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole. In the 
1 st century the population of Alexandria contained over 180000 adult male citizens55 according to a census dated from 32 AD in addition to a large number of freedmen women children and slaves. Estimates of the total population range from 21600056 to 50000057 making it one of the largest cities ever built before the Industrial Revolution and the largest preindustrial city that was not an imperial capital.citation needed Cityscapeedit Due to the constant presence of war in Alexandria in ancient times very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbour and the rest has been built over in modern times. Pompeys Pillaredit Roman Pompeys Pillar Pompeys Pillar a Roman triumphal column is one of the bestknown ancient monuments still standing in Alexandria today. It is located on Alexandrias ancient acropolisa modest hill located adjacent to the citys Arab cemeteryand was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its pedestal it is 30 m 99 ft high the shaft is of polished red granite 
2.7  m 
8.9  ft in diameter at the base tapering to 
2.4  m 
7.9  ft at the top. The shaft is 88 ft 27 m high and made out of a single piece of granite. Its volume is 132 m3 4662 cu ft and weight approximately 396 tons.58 Pompeys Pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient obelisks. The Romans had cranes but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several obelisk erecting experiments including a successful attempt to erect a 
25 ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 
25 ton obelisk.5960 Pompeys Pillar is a misnomer as it has nothing to do with Pompey having been erected in 293 for Diocletian possibly in memory of the rebellion of Domitius Domitianus.citation needed The structure was plundered and demolished in the 
4 th century when a bishop decreed that Paganism must be eradicated.citation needed Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum where the mysteries of the god Serapis were enacted and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years many ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea mostly pieces of old pottery.citation needed Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafaedit Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa Alexandrias catacombs known as Kom El Shoqafa are a short distance southwest of the pillar consist of a multilevel labyrinth reached via a large spiral staircase and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars statues and other syncretic RomanoEgyptian religious symbols burial niches and sarcophagi as well as a large Romanstyle banquet room where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased. The catacombs were long forgotten by the citizens until they were discovered by accident in 19
00.6 1 Kom El Dekaedit Roman Amphitheater The most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as Kom El Deka. It has revealed the ancient citys wellpreserved theater and the remains of its Romanera baths. Temple of Taposiris Magnaedit Main article Abusir Lake Mariout Side view of The Temple of Taposiris Magna The temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries. Also found in the same area are remains of public baths built by the emperor Justinian a seawall quays and a bridge. Near the beach side of the area there are the remains of a tower built by Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The tower was an exact scale replica of the destroyed Alexandrine Pharos Lighthouse.62 Citadel of Qaitbayedit Citadel of Qaitbay Citadel of Qaitbay is a defensive fortress located on the Mediterranean sea coast. It was established in 1477 AD 882 AH by the mamluk Sultan AlAshraf Sayf alDin Qait Bay. The Citadel is located on the eastern side of the northern tip of Pharos Island at the mouth of the Eastern Harbour. It was erected on the exact site of the famous Lighthouse of Alexandria which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was built on an area of 17550 square metres. Excavationedit This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. July 2023 Learn how and when to remove this message Persistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local Archaeological Society and by many individuals. Excavations were performed in the city by Greeks seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great without success.63 The past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered D. G. Hogarth made tentative researches on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895 and a German expedition worked for two years 18981899. But two difficulties face the wouldbe excavator in Alexandria lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest. Since the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig except at enormous cost. Cleopatra VIIs royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami leading to gradual subsidence in the 
4 th century AD.64 This underwater section containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city including the palace quarter was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team.65 It raised a noted head of Caesarion.66 These are being opened up to tourists to some controversy.67 The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman strata. The most important results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti late director of the museum in the neighborhood of Pompeys Pillar where there is a good deal of open ground. Here substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby immense catacombs and columbaria have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs now artificially lit and open to visitors. The objects found in these researches are in the museum the most notable being a great basalt bull probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in Kom El Shoqafa Roman and Ras El Tin painted. The German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the northeast of the city but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of Kom El Deka which may have been part of the Paneum the Mausolea or a Roman fortress. The making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered.

Until 430 the Patriarch of Alexandria was second only to the bishop of Rome. The Church of Alexandria had jurisdiction over most of the continent of Africa. After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451 the Alexandrian Church split between the Miaphysites and the Melkites. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the Coptic Orthodox Church. The Melkites went on to constitute what is known today as the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria. In the 
19 th century Catholic and Protestant missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths. Today the Patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is Saint Mark Cathedral though in practice the Patriarch has long resided in Cairo. The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include Pope Cyril I Church in Cleopatra Saint Georges Church in Sporting Saint Mark  Pope Peter I Church in Sidi Bishr Saint Mary Church in Assafra Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis Saint Mina Church in Fleming Saint Mina Church in Mandara and Saint Takla Haymanots Church in Ibrahimeya.

The city is also the nominal see of the Melkite Greek Catholic titular Patriarchate of Alexandria generally vested in its leading Patriarch of Antioch and the actual cathedral see of its Patriarchal territory of Egypt Sudan and South Sudan which uses the Byzantine Rite and the nominal see of the Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Alexandria for all Egypt and Sudan whose actual cathedral is in Cairo a suffragan of the Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia using the Armenian Rite. The Saint Mark Church in Shatby founded as part of Collge Saint Marc is multidenominational and holds liturgies according to Latin Catholic Coptic Catholic and Coptic Orthodox rites. In antiquity Alexandria was a major centre of the cosmopolitan religious movement called Gnosticism69 today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy. Judaismedit Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue Alexandrias Jewish community declined rapidly following the 1948 ArabIsraeli War after which negative reactions towards Zionism among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city and elsewhere in Egypt being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt moved to the newly settled Israel France Brazil and other countries in the 19
50 s and 19
60 s. The community once numbered 50000 but is now estimated at below

It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the library complex the temple of the Musesthe Museion Greek  from which the Modern English word museum is derived. It has been reasonably established that the library or parts of the collection were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult expensive and timeconsuming.

One effect of the newly created Hellenistic kingdoms was the imposition of Greek cities occupied by Greeks on an alien landscape. In Egypt there was a native Egyptian population with its own culture history and traditions. The Greeks who came to Egypt to the court or to live in Alexandria were separated from their original cultures. Alexandria was the main Greek city of Egypt and within it there was an extraordinary mix of Greeks from many cities and backgrounds.  Erskine Andrew April 1995.

But the emphasis on Greek culture does even more than this  these are Greeks ruling in a foreign land. The more Greeks can indulge in their own culture the more they can exclude nonGreeks in other words Egyptians the subjects whose land has been taken over. The assertion of Greek culture serves to enforce Egyptian subjection. So the presence in Alexandria of two institutions devoted to the preservation and study of Greek culture acts as a powerful symbol of Egyptian exclusion and subjection. Texts from other cultures could be kept in the library but only once they had been translated that is to say Hellenized. ... A reading of Alexandrian poetry might easily give the impression that Egyptians did not exist at all indeed Egypt itself is hardly mentioned except for the Nile and the Nile flood ... This omission of the Egypt and Egyptians from poetry masks a fundamental insecurity. It is no coincidence that one of the few poetic references to Egyptians presents them as muggers.
