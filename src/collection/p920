The dynasty would periodically expand its territory from the Nile delta and valley South beyond the second cataract and East into Canaan. The Twelfth Dynasty was marked by relative stability and development. It has a notably well recorded history for the period. Its first pharaoh was Amenemhat I and its final was Sobekneferu. Historyedit The chronology of the Twelfth Dynasty is the most stable of any period before the New Kingdom. The Turin Royal Canon gives 213 years 19911778 BC. Manetho stated that it was based in Thebes but from contemporary records it is clear that the first king of this dynasty Amenemhat I moved its capital to a new city named Amenemhatitjtawy Amenemhat the Seizer of the Two Lands more simply called Itjtawy.1 The location of Itjtawy has not been discovered yet but is thought to be near the Fayyum probably near the royal graveyards at elLisht.2 The order of its rulers of the Twelfth Dynasty is well known from several sources two lists recorded at temples in Abydos and one at Saqqara as well as lists derived from Manethos work. A recorded date during the reign of Senusret III can be correlated to the Sothic cycle3 consequently many events during this dynasty frequently can be assigned to a specific year. However scholars now have expressed skepticism in the usefulness of the referred date due to the fact that location affects observation of the Sothic cycle.4 Egypt underwent various developments under the Twelfth Dynasty including the reorganization of the kingdoms administration and agricultural developments in the Fayyum. The Twelfth Dynasty was also responsible for significant expansion of Egyptian borders with campaigns pushing into Nubia and the Levant.citation needed The Twelfth Dynasty is often considered the apex of Egypts Middle Kingdom. The Middle Kingdom spans the Eleventh Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties but some scholars only consider the 
11 th and

His armies campaigned south as far as the Second Cataract of the Nile and into southern Canaan. As a part of his militaristic expansion of Egypt Amenemhat I ordered the construction of multiple military forts in Nubia.6 He also reestablished diplomatic relations with the Canaanite state of Byblos and Hellenic rulers in the Aegean Sea. He was the father of Senusret I. Senusret Iedit For the first ten years of his reign Senusret I ruled as a coregent alongside his father Amenemhat I. He continued his fathers campaigns into Nubia expanding Egyptian control to the Third Cataract of the Nile.6 In addition to pursuing militaristic expansion Senusret I was also responsible for internal growth within Egypt. As king he initiated a considerable amount of building projects across Egypt including pyramids in Lisht a temple at Karnak and oversaw the renovation of the kingdoms major temples.4 Amenemhat IIedit A figure wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt and whose face appears to reflect the features of the reigning king most probably Amenemhat II or Senwosret II. It functioned as a divine guardian for the imiut and it is wearing a divine kilt which suggests that the statuette was not merely a representation of the living ruler.7 Unlike his predecessors Amenemhat II was king during a time of peace. Under his reign trade boomed with other states in Asia the Mediterranean and Africa. Built his mortuary complex near Memphis at Dahshur.6 Senusret IIedit A map showing the north of Egypt with the Fayyum highlighted in the black square. Senusret II also reigned during a time of peace. He was the first king to develop the Fayyum Basin for agricultural production. This development was complex requiring the digging of several canals and the draining of a lake in order to maximize the Fayyums agricultural output. The Middle Kingdom development of the Fayyum later became the basis for the Ptolemaic and Roman efforts that turned the region into the bread basket of the Mediterranean.6 Head of Senusret III with youthful features

12 th Dynasty Senusret IIIedit Finding Nubia had grown restive under the previous rulers Senusret sent punitive expeditions into that land. As a part of his effort to suppress Nubia he ordered the construction of several new fortresses as well as the expansion of existing ones along the Egyptian border.8 He also sent an expedition into the Levant. Senusret IIIs military career contributed to his reverence during the New Kingdom as he was regarded as a warrior king and even revered as a god in Nubia.4 One of Senusret IIIs significant internal developments was the centralization of administrative power in the kingdom which replaced the nome system with three large administrative districts that encompassed all of Egypt.6 Amenemhat IIIedit Senusrets successor Amenemhat III reaffirmed his predecessors foreign policy. However after Amenemhat the energies of this dynasty were largely spent and the growing troubles of government were left to the dynastys last ruler Sobekneferu to resolve. Amenemhat was remembered for the mortuary temple at Hawara that he built. Amenemhat IVedit Amenemhat IV succeeded his father Amenemhat III and ruled for approximately nine years. At the time of his death Amenemhat IV had no apparent heir leading to Sobekneferus ascension to the throne. Sobekneferuedit Sobekneferu a daughter of Amenemhat III was the first known woman to become king of Egypt.4 She was left with the unresolved governmental issues that are noted as arising during her fathers reign when she succeeded Amenemhat IV thought to be her brother half brother or step brother.9 Upon his death she became the heir to the throne because her older sister Neferuptah who would have been the next in line to rule died at an early age. Sobekneferu was the last king of the twelfth dynasty. There is no record of her having an heir. She also had a relatively short nearly four year reign and the next dynasty began with a shift in succession possibly to unrelated heirs of Amenemhat IV.10 Ancient Egyptian literature refinededit Several famous works of Egyptian literature originated from the 
12 th Dynasty. Perhaps the best known work from this period is The Story of Sinuhe of which papyrus copies dating as late as the New Kingdom have been recovered.11 Some of the existing literature pertaining to the 
12 th Dynasty are propagandistic in nature. The Prophecy of Nefertiestablishes a revisionist account of history that legitimizes Amenemhat Is rule. Written during the reign of Amenemhat I described a sages prophecy given to the 
4 th Dynasty King Snefru that predicted a destructive civil war. It writes that the sage Neferti prophesied that a great king named Ameny Amenemhat I would lead a united Egypt out of this tumultuous period.11 The work also mentions Amenemhat Is mother being from12 the Elephantine Egyptian nome TaSeti.1314151617181920 Many scholars in recent years have argued that Amenemhat Is mother was of Nubian origin.21222324252627 Other known works attributed to the
