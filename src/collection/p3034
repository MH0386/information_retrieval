He was a member of the Severan dynasty the elder son of Emperor Septimius Severus and Empress Julia Domna. Proclaimed coruler by his father in 198 he reigned jointly with his brother Geta coemperor from 209 after their fathers death in 211. His brother was murdered by the Praetorian Guard later that year under orders from Caracalla who then reigned afterwards as sole ruler of the Roman Empire. Caracalla found administration to be mundane leaving those responsibilities to his mother. Caracallas reign featured domestic instability and external invasions by the Germanic peoples. Caracallas reign became notable for the Antonine Constitution Latin Constitutio Antoniniana also known as the Edict of Caracalla which granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Roman Empire. The edict gave all the enfranchised men Caracallas adopted praenomen and nomen Marcus Aurelius. Domestically Caracalla became known for the construction of the Baths of Caracalla which became the secondlargest baths in Rome for the introduction of a new Roman currency named the antoninianus a sort of double denarius and for the massacres he ordered both in Rome and elsewhere in the empire. In 216 Caracalla began a campaign against the Parthian Empire. He did not see this campaign through to completion due to his assassination by a disaffected soldier in 217. Macrinus succeeded him as emperor three days later. The ancient sources portray Caracalla as a tyrant and as a cruel leader an image that has survived into modernity. His contemporaries Cassius Dio c. 155  c. 235 and Herodian c. 170  c. 240 present him as a soldier first and an emperor second. In the 
12 th century Geoffrey of Monmouth started the legend of Caracallas role as king of Britain. Later in the 
18 th century the works of French painters revived images of Caracalla due to apparent parallels between Caracallas tyranny and that ascribed to king Louis XVI r.17741792. Modern works continue to portray Caracalla as an evil ruler painting him as one of the most tyrannical of all Roman emperors. Names Caracallas name at birth was Lucius Septimius Bassianus. He was renamed Marcus Aurelius Antoninus at the age of seven as part of his fathers attempt at union with the families of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius.451 According to the 
4 thcentury historian Aurelius Victor in his Epitome de Caesaribus he became known by the agnomen Caracalla after a Gallic hooded tunic that he habitually wore and made fashionable.6 He may have begun wearing it during his campaigns on the Rhine and Danube.7 Cassius Dio who was still writing his Historia romana during Caracallas reign8 generally referred to him as Tarautas after a famously diminutive and violent gladiator of the time though he also calls him Caracallus in various occasions.9 Early life Young Caracalla Hermitage Museum Saint Petersburg Caracalla was born in Lugdunum Gaul now Lyon France on 4 April 188 to Septimius Severus r.193211 and Julia Domna thus giving him Punic paternal ancestry and Arab maternal ancestry.10 He had a slightly younger brother Geta with whom Caracalla briefly ruled as coemperor.411 Caracalla was five years old when his father was acclaimed Augustus on 9 April 1

98.1 42 This was the day Septimius Severuss triumph was celebrated in honour of his victory over the Parthian Empire in the RomanPersian Wars he had successfully sacked the Parthian capital Ctesiphon after winning the Battle of Ctesiphon probably in October 1
97.1 5 He was also awarded tribunician power and the title of imperator.12 In inscriptions Caracalla is given from 198 the title of the chief priesthood pontifex maximus.1312 His brother Geta was proclaimed nobilissimus caesar on the same day and their father Septimius Severus was awarded the victory name Parthicus Maximus.12 In 199 he was inducted into the Arval Brethren.13 By the end of 199 he was entitled pater patriae.13 In 202 he was Roman consul having been named consul designatus the previous year.13 His colleague was his father serving his own third consulship.15 In 202 Caracalla was forced to marry the daughter of Gaius Fulvius Plautianus Fulvia Plautilla a woman whom he hated though for what reason is unknown.16 The wedding took place between the 9 and the 15 April.13 Caracalla  Geta Bearfight in the Colosseum Lawrence AlmaTadema 1907 In 205 Caracalla was consul for the second time in company with Geta  his brothers first consulship.13 By 205 Caracalla had got Plautianus executed for treason though he had probably fabricated the evidence of the plot.16 It was then that he banished his wife whose later killing might have been carried out under Caracallas orders.416 On 28 January 207 Caracalla celebrated his decennalia the tenth anniversary of the beginning of his reign.13 The year 208 was the year of his third and Getas second consulship.13 Geta was himself granted the rank of Augustus and tribunician powers in September or October 2
09.1 31712 During the reign of his father Caracallas mother Julia Domna had played a prominent public role receiving titles of honour such as Mother of the camp but she also played a role behind the scenes helping her husband administer the empire.18 Described as ambitious19 Julia Domna surrounded herself with thinkers and writers from all over the empire.20 While Caracalla was mustering and training troops for his planned Persian invasion Julia remained in Rome administering the empire. Julias growing influence in state affairs was the beginning of a trend of emperors mothers having influence which continued throughout the Severan dynasty.21 Reign as senior emperor Geta as coaugustus On 4 February 211 Septimius Severus died at Eboracum present day York England while on campaign in Caledonia to the north of Roman Britain.22 This left his two sons and coaugusti Caracalla and his brother Geta as joint inheritors of their fathers throne and empire.1722 Caracalla adopted his fathers cognomen Severus and assumed the chief priesthood as pontifex maximus.23 His name became Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Severus Antoninus Pius Augustus.23 Caracalla and Geta ended the Roman invasion of Caledonia after concluding a peace with the Caledonians that returned the border of Roman Britain to the line demarcated by Hadrians Wall.1724 During the journey back from Britain to Rome with their fathers ashes Caracalla and his brother continuously argued with one another making relations between them increasingly hostile.1724 Caracalla and Geta considered dividing the empire in half along the Bosphorus to make their corule less hostile. Caracalla was to rule in the west and Geta was to rule in the east. They were persuaded not to do this by their mother.24 Getas murder Geta Dying in his Mothers Arms JacquesAugustinCatherine Pajou 17661828 Staatsgalerie Stuttgart On 26 December 211 at a reconciliation meeting arranged by their mother Geta was assassinated by members of the Praetorian Guard loyal to Caracalla. Geta died in his mothers arms. It is widely accepted and clearly most likely that Caracalla ordered the assassination himself as the two had never been on favourable terms with one another much less after succeeding their father.22 Caracalla then persecuted and executed most of Getas supporters and ordered a damnatio memoriae pronounced by the Senate against his brothers memory.625 Getas image was removed from all paintings coins were melted down statues were destroyed his name was struck from papyrus records and it became a capital offence to speak or write Getas name.26 In the aftermath of the damnatio memoriae an estimated 20000 people were massacred.2526 Those killed were Getas inner circle of guards and advisers friends and other military staff under his employ.25 Reign as sole emperor When Geta died in 211 Julia Domnas responsibilities increased because Caracalla found administrative tasks to be mundane.18 She may have taken on one of the more important civil functions of the emperor receiving petitions and answering correspondence.27 The extent of her role in this position however is probably overstated. She may have represented her son and played a role in meetings and answering queries however the final authority on legal matters was Caracalla.27 The emperor filled all of the roles in the legal system as judge legislator and administrator.27 Constitutio Antoniniana Main article Constitutio Antoniniana Portrait of Caracalla AD 212217 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art The Constitutio Antoniniana lit. Constitution of Antoninus also called Edict of Caracalla or Antonine Constitution was an edict issued in 212 by Caracalla declaring that all free men in the Roman Empire were to be given full Roman citizenship28 with the exception of the dediticii people who had become subject to Rome through surrender in war and freed slaves.2930313233 Before 212 the majority of Roman citizens had been inhabitants of Roman Italia with about 47 of all peoples in the Roman Empire being Roman citizens at the time of the death of Augustus in AD 14. Outside Rome citizenship was restricted to Roman coloniaea  Romans or their descendants living in the provinces the inhabitants of various cities throughout the Empire  and small numbers of local nobles such as kings of client countries. Provincials on the other hand were usually noncitizens although some magistrates and their families and relatives held the Latin Right.b37 Dio maintains that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was the desire to increase state revenue at the time Rome was in a difficult financial situation and needed to pay for the new pay raises and benefits that were being conferred on the military.38 The edict widened the obligation for public service and gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation taxes that only had to be paid by Roman citizens.39 However few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy and while it is true that Rome was in a difficult financial situation it is thought that this could not have been the sole purpose of the edict.38 The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were now able to think of themselves as equal partners to the Romans in the empire.39 Another purpose for issuing the edict as described within the papyrus upon which part of the edict was inscribed was to appease the gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy.40 The conspiracy in question was in response to Caracallas murder of Geta and the subsequent slaughter of his followers fratricide would only have been condoned if his brother had been a tyrant.41 The damnatio memoriae against Geta and the large payments Caracalla had made to his own supporters were designed to protect himself from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded Caracalla felt the need to repay the gods of Rome by returning the favour to the people of Rome through a similarly grand gesture. This was done through the granting of citizenship.4142 Another purpose for issuing the edict might have been related to the fact that the periphery of the empire was now becoming central to its existence and the granting of citizenship may have been simply a logical outcome of Romes continued expansion of citizenship rights.4243 Alamannic war Bust of Julia Domna Museo Chiaramonti In 213 about a year after Getas death Caracalla left Rome never to return.39 He went north to the German frontier to deal with the Alamanni a confederation of Germanic tribes who had broken through the limes in Raetia.3944 During the campaign of 213214 Caracalla successfully defeated some of the Germanic tribes while settling other difficulties through diplomacy though precisely with whom these treaties were made remains unknown.4445 While there Caracalla strengthened the frontier fortifications of Raetia and Germania Superior collectively known as the Agri Decumates so that it was able to withstand any further barbarian invasions for another twenty years. Provincial tour The Roman Empire during the reign of Caracalla In spring 214 Caracalla departed for the eastern provinces travelling through the Danubian provinces and the Anatolian provinces of Asia and Bithynia.13 He spent the winter of 214215 in Nicomedia. By 4 April 215 he had left Nicomedia and in the summer he was in Antioch on the Orontes.13 By December 215 he was in Alexandria in the Nile Delta where he stayed until March or April 2
16.1 3 When the inhabitants of Alexandria heard of Caracallas claims that he had killed his brother Geta in selfdefence they produced a satire mocking this as well as Caracallas other pretensions.4647 Caracalla responded to this insult by slaughtering the deputation of leading citizens who had unsuspectingly assembled before the city to greet his arrival in December 215 before setting his troops against Alexandria for several days of looting and plunder.3948 In spring 216 he returned to Antioch and before 27 May had set out to lead his Roman army against the Parthians.13 During the winter of 215216 he was in Edessa.13 Caracalla then moved east into Armenia. By 216 he had pushed through Armenia and south into Parthia.49 Baths Main article Baths of Caracalla The Baths of Caracalla Construction on the Baths of Caracalla began in 211 at the start of Caracallas rule. The thermae are named for Caracalla though it is most probable that his father was responsible for their planning. In 216 a partial inauguration of the baths took place but the outer perimeter of the baths was not completed until the reign of Severus Alexander.50 These large baths were typical of the Roman practice of building complexes for social and state activities in large densely populated cities.50 The baths covered around 50 acres or 202000 square metres of land and could accommodate around 1600 bathers at any one time.50 They were the second largest public baths built in ancient Rome and were complete with swimming pools exercise yards a stadium steam rooms libraries meeting rooms fountains and other amenities all of which were enclosed within formal gardens.5051 The interior spaces were decorated with colourful marble floors columns mosaics and colossal statuary.52 Caracalla and Serapis Caracalla as Pharaoh Temple of Kom Ombo At the outset of his reign Caracalla declared imperial support for the GraecoEgyptian god of healing Serapis. The Iseum and Serapeum in Alexandria were apparently renovated during Caracallas corule with his father Septimius Severus. The evidence for this exists in two inscriptions found near the temple that appear to bear their names. Additional archaeological evidence exists for this in the form of two papyri that have been dated to the Severan period and also two statues associated with the temple that have been dated to around 200 AD. Upon Caracallas ascension to being sole ruler in 212 the imperial mint began striking coins bearing Serapis image. This was a reflection of the gods central role during Caracallas reign. After Getas death the weapon that had killed him was dedicated to Serapis by Caracalla. This was most likely done to cast Serapis into the role of Caracallas protector from treachery.53 Caracalla also erected a temple on the Quirinal Hill in 212 which he dedicated to Serapis.48 A fragmented inscription found in the church of Sant Agata dei Goti in Rome records the construction or possibly restoration of a temple dedicated to the god Serapis. The inscription bears the name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus a reference to either Caracalla or Elagabalus but more likely to Caracalla due to his known strong association with the god. Two other inscriptions dedicated to Serapis as well as a granite crocodile similar to one discovered at the Iseum et Serapeum were also found in the area around the Quirinal Hill.54 Monetary policy O laureate head of Caracalla ANTONINVS PIVS AVG.

81 b C 359 The expenditures that Caracalla made with the large bonuses he gave to soldiers prompted him to debase the coinage soon after his ascension.6 At the end of Severus reign and early into Caracallas the Roman denarius had an approximate silver purity of around 55 but by the end of Caracallas reign the purity had been reduced to about 
51.5 556 In 215 Caracalla introduced the antoninianus a coin intended to serve as a double denarius.57 This new currency however had a silver purity of about 52 for the period between 215 and 217 and an actual size ratio of 1 antoninianus to 
1.5  denarii. This in effect made the antoninianus equal to about 
1.5  denarii.585960 The reduced silver purity of the coins caused people to hoard the old coins that had higher silver content aggravating the inflation problem caused by the earlier devaluation of the denarii.5758 Military policy Statue of Helios with features of Caracalla and Alexander marble Roman ca.

3 rd century AD North Carolina Museum of Art. During his reign as emperor Caracalla raised the annual pay of an average legionary from 2000 sesterces 500 denarii to 27003000 sesterces 675750 denarii. He lavished many benefits on the army which he both feared and admired in accordance with the advice given by his father on his deathbed always to heed the welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else.1744 Caracalla needed to gain and keep the trust of the military and he did so with generous pay raises and popular gestures.61 He spent much of his time with the soldiers so much so that he began to imitate their dress and adopt their manners.66263 After Caracalla concluded his campaign against the Alamanni it became evident that he was inordinately preoccupied with emulating Alexander the Great.6465 He began openly mimicking Alexander in his personal style. In planning his invasion of the Parthian Empire Caracalla decided to arrange 16000 of his men in Macedonianstyle phalanxes despite the Roman army having made the phalanx an obsolete tactical formation.646566 The historian Christopher Matthew mentions that the term Phalangarii has two possible meanings both with military connotations. The first refers merely to the Roman battle line and does not specifically mean that the men were armed with pikes and the second bears similarity to the Marian Mules of the late Roman Republic who carried their equipment suspended from a long pole which were in use until at least the 
2 nd century AD.66 As a consequence the phalangarii of Legio II Parthica may not have been pikemen but rather standard battle line troops or possibly triarii.66 Caracallas mania for Alexander went so far that he visited Alexandria while preparing for his Persian invasion and persecuted philosophers of the Aristotelian school based on a legend that Aristotle had poisoned Alexander. This was a sign of Caracallas increasingly erratic behaviour.65 Parthian war Main article Parthian war of Caracalla In 216 Caracalla pursued a series of aggressive campaigns in the east against the Parthians intended to bring more territory under direct Roman control. He offered the king of Parthia Artabanus IV of Parthia a marriage proposal between himself and the kings daughter.767 Artabanus refused the offer realizing that the proposal was merely an attempt to unite the kingdom of Parthia under the control of Rome.67 In response Caracalla used the opportunity to start a campaign against the Parthians. That summer Caracalla began to attack the countryside east of the Tigris in the Parthian war of Caracalla.67 In the following winter Caracalla retired to Edessa modern anlurfa in southeast Turkey and began making preparations to renew the campaign by spring.67 Death At the beginning of 217 Caracalla was still based at Edessa before renewing hostilities against Parthia.7 On 8 April 217 Caracalla was travelling to visit a temple near Carrhae now Harran in southern Turkey where in 53 BC the Romans had suffered a defeat at the hands of the Parthians.7 After stopping briefly to urinate Caracalla was approached by a soldier Justin Martialis and stabbed to death.7 Martialis had been incensed by Caracallas refusal to grant him the position of centurion and the praetorian prefect Macrinus Caracallas successor saw the opportunity to use Martialis to end Caracallas reign.67 In the immediate aftermath of Caracallas death his murderer Martialis was killed as well.7 When Caracalla was murdered Julia Domna was in Antioch sorting out correspondence removing unimportant messages from the bunch so that when Caracalla returned he would not be overburdened with duties.18 Three days later Macrinus declared himself emperor with the support of the Roman army.6869 Gold medallion of Caracalla Bode Museum Berlin Portraiture This medallion exemplifies the typical manner in which Caracalla was depicted Walters Art Museum Baltimore Caracallas official portrayal as sole emperor marks a break from the detached images of the philosopheremperors who preceded him his closecropped haircut is that of a soldier his pugnacious scowl a realistic and threatening presence. This rugged soldieremperor an iconic archetype was adopted by most of the following emperors such as Maximinus Thrax who were dependent on the support of the troops to rule the empire.7071 Herodian describes Caracalla as having preferred northern European clothing Caracalla being the name of the short Gaulish cloak that he made fashionable and he often wore a blond wig.72 Dio mentions that when Caracalla was a boy he had a tendency to show an angry or even savage facial expression.73 The way Caracalla wanted to be portrayed to his people can be seen through the many surviving busts and coins. Images of the young Caracalla cannot be clearly distinguished from his younger brother Geta.74 On the coins Caracalla was shown laureate after becoming augustus in 197 Geta is bareheaded until he became augustus himself in 2
09.7 5 Between 209 and their fathers death in February 211 both brothers are shown as mature young men who were ready to take over the empire. Between the death of the father and the assassination of Geta towards the end of 211 Caracallas portrait remains static with a short full beard while Geta develops a long beard with hair strains like his father. The latter was a strong indicator of Getas effort to be seen as the true successor to their father an effort that came to naught when he was murdered.75 Caracallas presentation on coins during the period of his coreign with his father from 198 to 210 are in broad terms in line with the thirdcentury imperial representation most coin types communicate military and religious messages with other coins giving messages of saeculum aureum and virtues.76 During Caracallas sole reign from 212 to 217 a significant shift in representation took place. The majority of coins produced during this period made associations with divinity or had religious messages others had nonspecific and unique messages that were only circulated during Caracallas sole rule.77 Legacy Damnatio memoriae Caracalla was not subject to a proper damnatio memoriae after his assassination while the Senate disliked him his popularity with the military prevented Macrinus and the Senate from openly declaring him to be a hostis. Macrinus in an effort to placate the Senate instead ordered the secret removal of statues of Caracalla from public view. After his death the public made comparisons between him and other condemned emperors and called for the horse race celebrating his birthday to be abolished and for gold and silver statues dedicated to him to be melted down. These events were however limited in scope most erasures of his name from inscriptions were either accidental or occurred as a result of reuse. Macrinus had Caracalla deified and commemorated on coins as Divus Antoninus. There does not appear to have been any intentional mutilation of Caracalla in any images that were created during his reign as sole emperor.78 Bronze portrait of Caracalla Antikensammlung Berlin Classical portrayal Caracalla wearing nemes and uraeus headdress as Roman pharaoh from the Nile bank opposite Terenouthis. Alexandria National Museum79 Caracalla is presented in the ancient sources of Dio Herodian and the Historia Augusta as a cruel tyrant and savage ruler.80 This portrayal of Caracalla is only further supported by the murder of his brother Geta and the subsequent massacre of Getas supporters that Caracalla ordered.80 Alongside this these contemporary sources present Caracalla as a soldieremperor for his preference of the soldiery over the senators a depiction that made him even less popular with the senatorial biographers.80 Dio explicitly presented Caracalla as an emperor who marched with the soldiers and behaved like a soldier. Dio also often referred to Caracallas large military expenditures and the subsequent financial problems this caused.80 These traits dominate Caracallas image in the surviving classical literature.81 The Baths of Caracalla are presented in classical literature as unprecedented in scale and impossible to build if not for the use of reinforced concrete.82 The Edict of Caracalla issued in 212 however goes almost unnoticed in classical records.81 The Historia Augusta is considered by historians as the least trustworthy for all accounts of events historiography and biographies among the ancient works and is full of fabricated materials and sources.8384858687 The works of Herodian of Antioch are by comparison far less fantastic than the stories presented by the Historia Augusta.83 Historian Andrew G. Scott suggests that Dios work is frequently considered the best source for this period.88 However historian Clare Rowan questions Dios accuracy on the topic of Caracalla referring to the work as having presented a hostile attitude towards Caracalla and thus needing to be treated with caution.89 An example of this hostility is found in one section where Dio notes that Caracalla is descended from three different races and that he managed to combine all of their faults into one person the fickleness cowardice and recklessness of the Gauls the cruelty and harshness of the Africans and the craftiness that is associated with the Syrians.89 Despite this the outline of events as presented by Dio are described by Rowan as generally accurate while the motivations that Dio suggests are of questionable origin.89 An example of this is his presentation of the Edict of Caracalla the motive that Dio appends to this event is Caracallas desire to increase tax revenue. Olivier Hekster Nicholas Zair and Rowan challenge this presentation because the majority of people who were enfranchised by the edict would have been poor.3889 In her work Rowan also describes Herodians depiction of Caracalla more akin to a soldier than an emperor.90 Medieval legends Amethyst intaglio of Caracalla later recarved as Saint Peter inscribed with the Greek   translit. o Petros lit. the stone treasury of SainteChapelle Geoffrey of Monmouths pseudohistorical History of the Kings of Britain makes Caracalla a king of Britain referring to him by his actual name Bassianus rather than by the nickname Caracalla. In the story after Severus death the Romans wanted to make Geta king of Britain but the Britons preferred Bassianus because he had a British mother. The two brothers fought until Geta was killed and Bassianus succeeded to the throne after which he ruled until he was overthrown and killed by Carausius. However Carausius revolt actually happened about seventy years after Caracallas death in 2
17.9 1 Eighteenthcentury artworks and the French Revolution Septimius Severus and Caracalla JeanBaptiste Greuze 1769 Louvre Caracallas memory was revived in the art of late eighteenthcentury French painters. His tyrannical career became the subject of the work of several French painters such as Greuze Julien de Parme David Bonvoisin J.A.C. Pajou and Lethire. Their fascination with Caracalla was a reflection of the growing discontent of the French people with the monarchy. Caracallas visibility was influenced by the existence of several literary sources in French that included both translations of ancient works and contemporary works of the time. Caracallas likeness was readily available to the painters due to the distinct style of his portraiture and his unusual soldierlike choice of fashion that distinguished him from other emperors. The artworks may have served as a warning that absolute monarchy could become the horror of tyranny and that disaster could come about if the regime failed to reform. Art historian Susan Wood suggests that this reform was for the absolute monarchy to become a constitutional monarchy as per the original goal of revolution rather than the republic that it eventually became. Wood also notes the similarity between Caracalla and his crimes leading to his assassination and the eventual uprising against and death of King Louis XVI both rulers had died as a result of their apparent tyranny.92 Modern portrayal Caracalla has had a reputation as being among the worst of Roman emperors a perception that survives even into modern works.93 The art and linguistics historian John Agnew and the writer Walter Bidwell describe Caracalla as having an evil spirit referring to the devastation he wrought in Alexandria.94 The Roman historian David Magie describes Caracalla in the book Roman Rule in Asia Minor as brutal and tyrannical and points towards psychopathy as an explanation for his behaviour.9596 The historian Clifford Ando supports this description suggesting that Caracallas rule as sole emperor is notable almost exclusively for his crimes of theft massacre and mismanagement.97 
18 thcentury historian Edward Gibbon author of The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire takes Caracallas reputation which he had received for the murder of Geta and subsequent massacre of Getas supporters and applied it to Caracallas provincial tours suggesting that every province was by turn the scene of his rapine and cruelty.93 Gibbon compared Caracalla to emperors such as Hadrian who spent their careers campaigning in the provinces and then to tyrants such as Nero and Domitian whose entire reigns were confined to Rome and whose actions only impacted upon the senatorial and equestrian classes residing there. Gibbon then concluded that Caracalla was the common enemy of mankind as both Romans and provincials alike were subject to his rapine and cruelty.39 This representation is questioned by the historian Shamus Sillar who cites the construction of roads and reinforcement of fortifications in the western provinces among other things as being contradictory to the representation made by Gibbon of cruelty and destruction.98 The history professors Molefi Asante and Shaza Ismail note that Caracalla is known for the disgraceful nature of his rule stating that he rode the horse of power until it nearly died of exhaustion and that though his rule was short his life personality and acts made him a notable though likely not beneficial figure in the Roman Empire.99 Severan dynasty family tree v t e Severan family tree Septimius Macer Gaius Claudius Septimius Aper Fulvius Pius Lucius Septimius Severus Publius Septimius Aper Gaius Septimius Aper Fulvia Pia Publius Septimius Geta Septimia Polla Julius Bassianus Septimius Publius Septimius Geta Septimia Octavilla Paccia Marciana 1 Septimius Severus r.1932
