Nero was born at Antium in AD 37 the son of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Agrippina the Younger greatgranddaughter of the emperor Augustus. When Nero was three his father died.1 By the time Nero turned eleven2 his mother married Emperor Claudius who then adopted Nero as his heir. Upon Claudius death in AD 54 Nero ascended to the throne with the backing of the Praetorian Guard and the Senate. In the early years of his reign Nero was advised and guided by his mother Agrippina his tutor Seneca the Younger and his praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus but sought to rule independently and rid himself of restraining influences. The power struggle between Nero and his mother reached its climax when he orchestrated her murder. Roman sources also implicate Nero in the deaths of both his wife Claudia Octavia  supposedly so he could marry Poppaea Sabina  and his stepbrother Britannicus. Neros practical contributions to Romes governance focused on diplomacy trade and culture. He ordered the construction of amphitheaters and promoted athletic games and contests. He made public appearances as an actor poet musician and charioteer which scandalized his aristocratic contemporaries as these occupations were usually the domain of slaves public entertainers and infamous persons. However the provision of such entertainments made Nero popular among lowerclass citizens. The costs involved were borne by local elites either directly or through taxation and were much resented by the Roman aristocracy. During Neros reign the general Corbulo fought the RomanParthian War of 5863 and made peace with the hostile Parthian Empire. The Roman general Suetonius Paulinus quashed a major revolt in Britain led by queen Boudica. The Bosporan Kingdom was briefly annexed to the empire and the First JewishRoman War began. When the Roman senator Vindex rebelled with support from the eventual Roman emperor Galba Nero was declared a public enemy and condemned to death in absentia. He fled Rome and on 9 June AD 68 committed suicide. His death sparked a brief period of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors. Most Roman sources offer overwhelmingly negative assessments of his personality and reign. Most contemporary sources describe him as tyrannical selfindulgent and debauched. The historian Tacitus claims the Roman people thought him compulsive and corrupt. Suetonius tells that many Romans believed the Great Fire of Rome was instigated by Nero to clear land for his planned Golden House. Tacitus claims Nero seized Christians as scapegoats for the fire and had them burned alive seemingly motivated not by public justice but personal cruelty. Some modern historians question the reliability of ancient sources on Neros tyrannical acts considering his popularity among the Roman commoners. In the eastern provinces of the Empire a popular legend arose that Nero had not died and would return. After his death at least three leaders of shortlived failed rebellions presented themselves as Nero reborn to gain popular support. Early life Nero was born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus on 15 December AD 37 in Antium modern Anzio eight months after the death of Tiberius.34 He was an onlychild the son of the politician Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Agrippina the Younger. His mother Agrippina was the sister of the third Roman emperor Caligula.5 Nero was also the greatgreatgrandson of former emperor Augustus descended from Augustus only daughter Julia.6 Statue of Nero in his birthplace of Anzio Italy The ancient biographer Suetonius who was critical of Neros ancestors wrote that emperor Augustus had reproached Neros grandfather for his unseemly enjoyment of violent gladiator games. According to Jrgen Malitz Suetonius tells that Neros father was known to be irascible and brutal and that both enjoyed chariot races and theater performances to a degree not befitting their position.6 Suetonius also mentions that when Neros father Domitius was congratulated by his friends for the birth of his son he replied that any child born to him and Agrippina would have a detestable nature and become a public danger.3 Domitius died in AD 41. A few years before his fathers death his father was involved in a serious political scandal.6 His mother and his two surviving sisters Agrippina and Julia Livilla were exiled to a remote island in the Mediterranean Sea.7 His mother was said to have been exiled for plotting to overthrow the emperor Caligula.4 Neros inheritance was taken from him and he was sent to live with his paternal aunt Domitia Lepida the mother of later emperor Claudiuss third wife Messalina.8 After Caligulas death Claudius became the new emperor. Neros mother married Claudius in AD 49 becoming his fourth wife.i4 On 25 February AD 
50 ii Claudius was pressured to adopt Nero as his son giving him the new name of Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus.iii12 Claudius had gold coins issued to mark the adoption.13 Classics professor Josiah Osgood has written that the coins through their distribution and imagery alike showed that a new Leader was in the making.14 However David Shotter noted that despite events in Rome Neros stepbrother Britannicus was more prominent in provincial coinages during the early 
50 s.15 Relief from the Sebasteion depicting Nero and his mother Agrippina Nero formally entered public life as an adult in AD 51 while 13 years old.12 When he turned 16 Nero married Claudius daughter his stepsister Claudia Octavia. Between the years AD 51 and AD 53 he gave several speeches on behalf of various communities including the Ilians the Apameans requesting a fiveyear tax reprieve after an earthquake and the northern colony of Bologna after their settlement had suffered a devastating fire.14 Claudius died in AD 54 many ancient historians claim that he was poisoned by Agrippina. Shotter has written that Claudius death...has usually been regarded as an event hastened by Agrippina due to signs that Claudius was showing a renewed affection for his natural son. He notes that among ancient sources the Roman historian Josephus was uniquely reserved in describing the poisoning as a rumor.16 Contemporary sources differ in their accounts of the poisoning. Tacitus says that the poisonmaker Locusta prepared the toxin which was served to the Emperor by his servant Halotus. Tacitus also writes that Agrippina arranged for Claudius doctor Xenophon to administer poison in the event that the Emperor survived.16 Suetonius differs in some details but also implicates Halotus and Agrippina.iv Like Tacitus Cassius Dio writes that the poison was prepared by Locusta but in Dios account it is administered by Agrippina instead of Halotus. In Apocolocyntosis Seneca the Younger does not mention mushrooms at all.18 Agrippinas involvement in Claudius death is not accepted by all modern scholars.19 Before Claudius death Agrippina had maneuvered to remove Claudius sons tutors in order to replace them with tutors that she had selected. She was also able to convince Claudius to replace two prefects of the Praetorian Guard who were suspected of supporting Claudius son with Afranius Burrus Neros future guide.20 Since Agrippina had replaced the guard officers with men loyal to her Nero was subsequently able to assume power without incident.4 Reign AD 5468 The main ancient Roman literary sources for Neros reign are Tacitus Suetonius and Cassius Dio.21 They found Neros construction projects overly extravagant and claim that their cost left Italy thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money with the provinces ruined.2223 Modern historians note that the period was riddled with deflation and that Nero intended his spending on publicwork and charities to ease economic troubles.24 Early reign Bust of Nero as pharaoh Nero became emperor in AD 54 aged 16. His tutor Seneca prepared Neros first speech before the Senate. During this speech Nero spoke about eliminating the ills of the previous regime.25 H. H. Scullard writes that he promised to follow the Augustan model in his principate to end all secret trials intra cubiculum to have done with the corruption of court favorites and freedmen and above all to respect the privileges of the Senate and individual Senators.26 His respect for Senatorial autonomy which distinguished him from Caligula and Claudius was generally well received by the Roman Senate.27 Scullard writes that Neros mother Agrippina meant to rule through her son. Agrippina murdered her political rivals Domitia Lepida the Younger the aunt that Nero had lived with during Agrippinas exile Marcus Junius Silanus a greatgrandson of Augustus and Narcissus.26 One of the earliest coins that Nero issued during his reign shows Agrippina on the coins obverse side usually this would be reserved for a portrait of the emperor. The Senate also allowed Agrippina two lictors during public appearances an honor that was customarily bestowed upon only magistrates and the Vestalis Maxima.25 In AD 55 Nero removed Agrippinas ally Marcus Antonius Pallas from his position in the treasury. Shotter writes the following about Agrippinas deteriorating relationship with Nero What Seneca and Burrus probably saw as relatively harmless in Nerohis cultural pursuits and his affair with the slave girl Claudia Actewere to her signs of her sons dangerous emancipation of himself from her influence. Britannicus was poisoned after Agrippina threatened to side with him.28 Nero who was having an affair with Actev exiled Agrippina from the palace when she began to cultivate a relationship with his wife Octavia.26 Emperor Nero being instructed by Seneca work by Spanish sculptor Eduardo Barrn Jrgen Malitz writes that ancient sources do not provide any clear evidence to evaluate the extent of Neros personal involvement in politics during the first years of his reign. He describes the policies that are explicitly attributed to Nero as wellmeant but incompetent notions like Neros failed initiative to abolish all taxes in AD 58. Scholars generally credit Neros advisors Burrus and Seneca with the administrative successes of these years. Malitz writes that in later years Nero panicked when he had to make decisions on his own during times of crisis.29 Nevertheless his early administration ruled to great acclaim. A generation later those years were seen in retrospect as an exemplar of good and moderate government and described as Quinquennium Neronis by Trajan.3031 Especially well received were fiscal reforms which among others put tax collectors under more strict control by establishing local offices to supervise their activities.32 After the affair of Lucius Pedanius Secundus who was murdered by a desperate slave Nero allowed slaves to file complaints about their treatment to the authorities.33 Residences Outside of Rome Nero had several villas or palaces built the ruins of which can still be seen today. These included the Villa of Nero at Antium his place of birth where he razed the villa on the site to rebuild it on a more massive and imperial scale and including a theatre. At Subiaco Lazio34 near Rome he had 3 artificial lakes built with waterfalls bridges and walkways for the luxurious villa. He stayed at the Villa of Nero at Olympia Greece during his participation at the Olympic Games of AD 67. Matricide Coin of Nero and Poppaea Sabina Billon tetradrachm of Alexandria Egypt 25 mm

The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome cautiously notes that Neros reasons for killing his mother in AD 59 are not fully understood.4 According to Tacitus the source of conflict between Nero and his mother was Neros affair with Poppaea Sabina. In Histories Tacitus writes that the affair began while Poppaea was still married to Rufrius Crispinus but in his later work Annals Tacitus says Poppaea was married to Otho when the affair began.35 In Annals Tacitus writes that Agrippina opposed Neros affair with Poppaea because of her affection for his wife Octavia. Anthony A. Barrett writes that Tacitus account in Annals suggests that Poppaeas challenge drove Nero over the brink.36 A number of modern historians have noted that Agrippinas death would not have offered much advantage for Poppaea as Nero did not marry Poppaea until AD 
62.3 736 Barrett writes that Poppaea seems to serve as a literary device utilized by Tacitus because he could see no plausible explanation for Neros conduct and also incidentally served to show that Nero like Claudius had fallen under the malign influence of a woman.36 According to Suetonius Nero had his former freedman Anicetus arrange a shipwreck Agrippina survived the wreck swam ashore and was executed by Anicetus who reported her death as a suicide.438 Decline Modern scholars believe that Neros reign had been going well in the years before Agrippinas death. For example Nero promoted the exploration of the Nile river sources with a successful expedition.39 After Agrippinas exile Burrus and Seneca were responsible for the administration of the Empire.40 However Neros conduct became far more egregious after his mothers death.4 Miriam T. Griffins suggests that Neros decline began as early as AD 55 with the murder of his stepbrother Britannicus but also notes that Nero lost all sense of right and wrong and listened to flattery with total credulity after Agrippinas death. Griffin points out that Tacitus makes explicit the significance of Agrippinas removal for Neros conduct.4142 He began to build a new palace the Domus Transitoria from about AD 
60.4 3 It was intended to connect all of the imperial estates that had been acquired in various ways with the Palatine including the Gardens of Maecenas Horti Lamiani Horti Lolliani etc.4445 In AD 62 Neros adviser Burrus died.4 That same year Nero called for the first treason trial of his reign maiestas trial against Antistius Sosianus.4647 He also executed his rivals Cornelius Sulla and Rubellius Plautus.48 Jrgen Malitz considers this to be a turning point in Neros relationship with the Roman Senate. Malitz writes that Nero abandoned the restraint he had previously shown because he believed a course supporting the Senate promised to be less and less profitable.49 After Burrus death Nero appointed two new Praetorian prefects Faenius Rufus and Ofonius Tigellinus. Politically isolated Seneca was forced to retire.50 According to Tacitus Nero divorced Octavia on grounds of infertility and banished her.51 After public protests over Octavias exile Nero accused her of adultery with Anicetus and she was executed.5253 In AD 64 during the Saturnalia Nero married Pythagoras a freedman.5455565758 Great Fire of Rome Main article Great Fire of Rome The Fire of Rome by Hubert Robert 1785 The Great Fire of Rome began on the night of 18 to 19 July 64 probably in one of the merchant shops on the slope of the Aventine overlooking the Circus Maximus or in the wooden outer seating of the Circus itself. Rome had always been vulnerable to fires and this one was fanned to catastrophic proportions by the winds.5960 Tacitus Cassius Dio and modern archaeology describe the destruction of mansions ordinary residences public buildings and temples on the Aventine Palatine and Caelian hills.5961 The fire burned for over seven days before subsiding it then started again and burned for three more. It destroyed three of Romes 14 districts and severely damaged seven more.6263 Some Romans thought the fire an accident as the merchant shops were timberframed and sold flammable goods and the outer seating stands of the Circus were timberbuilt. Others claimed it was arson committed on Neros behalf. The accounts by Pliny the Elder Suetonius and Cassius Dio suggest several possible reasons for Neros alleged arson including his creation of a reallife backdrop to a theatrical performance about the burning of Troy. Suetonius wrote that Nero started the fire to clear the site for his planned palatial Golden House.64 This would include lush artificial landscapes and a 
30 metertall statue of himself the Colossus of Nero sited more or less where the Colosseum would eventually be built.656667 Suetonius and Cassius Dio claim that Nero sang the Sack of Ilium in stage costume while the city burned.686970 The popular legend that Nero played the lyre while Rome burned is at least partly a literary construct of Flavian propaganda ... which looked askance on the abortive Neronian attempt to rewrite Augustan models of rule.71 Tacitus suspends judgment on Neros responsibility for the fire he found that Nero was in Antium when the fire started and returned to Rome to organize a relief effort providing for the removal of bodies and debris which he paid for from his own funds.7273 After the fire Nero opened his palaces to provide shelter for the homeless and arranged for food supplies to be delivered in order to prevent starvation among the survivors.72 Tacitus writes that to remove suspicion from himself Nero accused Christians of starting the fire.74 According to this account many Christians were arrested and brutally executed by being thrown to the beasts crucified and being burned alive.75 Tacitus asserts that in his imposition of such ferocious punishments Nero was not motivated by a sense of justice but by a penchant for personal cruelty.76 Houses built after the fire were spaced out built in brick and faced by porticos on wide roads.77 Nero also built himself a new palace complex known as the Domus Aurea in an area cleared by the fire. The cost to rebuild Rome was immense requiring funds the state treasury did not have. To find the necessary funds for the reconstruction Neros government increased taxation.78 Particularly heavy tributes were imposed on the provinces of the empire.79 To meet at least a portion of the costs Nero devalued the Roman currency increasing inflationary pressure for the first time in the Empires history.vi Later years In AD 65 Gaius Calpurnius Piso a Roman statesman organized a conspiracy against Nero with the help of Subrius Flavus and Sulpicius Asper a tribune and a centurion of the Praetorian Guard.80 According to Tacitus many conspirators wished to rescue the state from the emperor and restore the Republic.81 The freedman Milichus discovered the conspiracy and reported it to Neros secretary Epaphroditus.82 As a result the conspiracy failed and its members were executed including Lucan the poet.83 Neros previous advisor Seneca was accused by Natalis he denied the charges but was still ordered to commit suicide as by this point he had fallen out of favor with Nero.84 Nero was said to have kicked Poppaea to death in AD 65 before she could give birth to his second child. Modern historians noting the probable biases of Suetonius Tacitus and Cassius Dio and the likely absence of eyewitnesses to such an event propose that Poppaea may have died after miscarriage or in childbirth.85 Nero went into deep mourning Poppaea was given a sumptuous state funeral and divine honors and was promised a temple for her cult. A years importation of incense was burned at the funeral. Her body was not cremated as would have been strictly customary but embalmed after the Egyptian manner and entombed it is not known where.86 In AD 67 Nero married Sporus a young boy who is said to have greatly resembled Poppaea. Nero had him castrated and married him with all the usual ceremonies including a dowry and a bridal veil. It is believed that he did this out of regret for his killing of Poppaea.8788 Revolt of Vindex and Galba and Neros death In March 68 Gaius Julius Vindex the governor of Gallia Lugdunensis rebelled against Neros tax policies.8990 Lucius Verginius Rufus the governor of Germania Superior was ordered to put down Vindexs rebellion.91 In an attempt to gain support from outside his own province Vindex called upon Servius Sulpicius Galba the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis to join the rebellion and to declare himself emperor in opposition to Nero.92 A marble bust of Nero Antiquarium of the Palatine. At the Battle of Vesontio in May 68 Verginius forces easily defeated those of Vindex and the latter committed suicide.91 However after defeating the rebel Verginius legions attempted to proclaim their own commander as Emperor. Verginius refused to act against Nero but the discontent of the legions of Germania and the continued opposition of Galba in Hispania did not bode well for him.93 While Nero had retained some control of the situation support for Galba increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy.92 The prefect of the Praetorian Guard Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support of Galba.94 In response Nero fled Rome with the intention of going to the port of Ostia and from there to take a fleet to one of the stillloyal eastern provinces. According to Suetonius Nero abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands responding with a line from Virgils Aeneid Is it so dreadful a thing then to die Nero then toyed with the idea of fleeing to Parthia throwing himself upon the mercy of Galba or appealing to the people and begging them to pardon him for his past offences and if he could not soften their hearts to entreat them at least to allow him the prefecture of Egypt. Suetonius reports that the text of this speech was later found in Neros writing desk but that he dared not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the Forum.95 Nero returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace. After sleeping he awoke at about midnight to find the palace guard had left. Dispatching messages to his friends palace chambers for them to come he received no answers. Upon going to their chambers personally he found them all abandoned. When he called for a gladiator or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him no one appeared. He cried Have I neither friend nor foe and ran out as if to throw himself into the Tiber.95 Returning Nero sought a place where he could hide and collect his thoughts. An imperial freedman Phaon offered his villa located 4 mi 
6.4  km outside the city. Travelling in disguise Nero and four loyal freedmen Epaphroditus Phaon Neophytus and Sporus reached the villa where Nero ordered them to dig a grave for him.96 At this time Nero learned that the Senate had declared him a public enemy.97 Nero prepared himself for suicide pacing up and down muttering Qualis artifex pereo What an artist the world is losing. Losing his nerve he begged one of his companions to set an example by killing himself first. At last the sound of approaching horsemen drove Nero to face the end. However he still could not bring himself to take his own life but instead forced his private secretary Epaphroditus to perform the task.98 An 1815 illustration of the alleged tomb of Nero actually tomb of proconsul Gaius Vibius Marianus. When one of the horsemen entered and saw that Nero was dying he attempted to stop the bleeding but efforts to save Neros life were unsuccessful. Neros final words were Too late This is fidelity.98 He died on 9 June 
68 vii the anniversary of the death of his first wife Claudia Octavia and was buried in the Mausoleum of the Domitii Ahenobarbi in what is now the Villa Borghese Pincian Hill area of Rome.98 According to Sulpicius Severus it is unclear whether Nero took his own life.99 With his death the JulioClaudian dynasty ended.10019 Chaos would ensue in the year of the Four Emperors.101 After Nero See also Nero Redivivus legend and PseudoNero Apotheosis of Nero c. after 68. Artwork portraying Nero rising to divine status after his death. According to Suetonius and Cassius Dio the people of Rome celebrated the death of Nero.102103 Tacitus though describes a more complicated political environment. Tacitus mentions that Neros death was welcomed by senators nobility and the upper class.104 The lower class slaves frequenters of the arena and the theater and those who were supported by the famous excesses of Nero on the other hand were upset with the news.104 Members of the military were said to have mixed feelings as they had allegiance to Nero but had been bribed to overthrow him.105 Eastern sources namely Philostratus and Apollonius of Tyana mention that Neros death was mourned as he restored the liberties of Hellas with a wisdom and moderation quite alien to his character and that he held our liberties in his hand and respected them.106 Modern scholarship generally holds that while the Senate and more welloff individuals welcomed Neros death the general populace was loyal to the end and beyond for Otho and Vitellius both thought it worthwhile to appeal to their nostalgia.107 Neros name was erased from some monuments in what Edward Champlin regards as an outburst of private zeal.108 Many portraits of Nero were reworked to represent other figures according to Eric R. Varner over 50 such images survive.109 This reworking of images is often explained as part of the way in which the memory of disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously110 a practice known as damnatio memoriae. Champlin doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images of Nero long after his death.111 Damaged portraits of Nero often with hammer blows directed to the face have been found in many provinces of the Roman Empire three recently having been identified from the United Kingdom.109112 The civil war during the year of the Four Emperors was described by ancient historians as a troubling period.101 According to Tacitus this instability was rooted in the fact that emperors could no longer rely on the perceived legitimacy of the imperial bloodline as Nero and those before him could.104 Galba began his short reign with the execution of many of Neros allies.113 One such notable enemy included Nymphidius Sabinus who claimed to be the son of Emperor Caligula.114 Otho overthrew Galba. Otho was said to be liked by many soldiers because he had been a friend of Nero and resembled him somewhat in temperament.115 It was said that the common Roman hailed Otho as Nero himself.116 Otho used Nero as a surname and reerected many statues to Nero.116 Vitellius overthrew Otho. Vitellius began his reign with a large funeral for Nero complete with songs written by Nero.117 After Neros death in AD 68 there was a widespread belief especially in the eastern provinces that he was not dead and somehow would return.118 This belief came to be known as the Nero Redivivus Legend. The legend of Neros return lasted for hundreds of years after Neros death. Augustine of Hippo wrote of the legend as a popular belief in AD 4
22.1 19 At least three Nero impostors emerged leading rebellions. The first who sang and played the cithara or lyre and whose face was similar to that of the dead emperor appeared in 69 AD during the reign of Vitellius.120 After persuading some to recognize him he was captured and executed.120 Sometime during the reign of Titus 7981 another impostor appeared in Asia and sang to the accompaniment of the lyre and looked like Nero but he too was killed.121122 Twenty years after Neros death during the reign of Domitian there was a third pretender. He was supported by the Parthians who only reluctantly gave him up103 and the matter almost came to war.101 Military conflicts Aureus of Nero c. AD 64 Aureus of Nero c. AD 68 Boudicas uprising Further information Boudican revolt In Britannia Britain in AD 59 Prasutagus leader of the Iceni tribe and a client king of Rome during Claudius reign had died. The client state arrangement was unlikely to survive following the death of Claudius. The will of the Iceni tribal King Prasutagus leaving control of the Iceni to his daughters was denied. When the Roman procurator Catus Decianus scourged Prasutagus wife Boudica and raped her daughters the Iceni revolted. They were joined by the Celtic Trinovantes tribe and their uprising became the most significant provincial rebellion of the 
1 st century AD.123124 Under Queen Boudica the towns of Camulodunum Colchester Londinium London and Verulamium St. Albans were burned and a substantial body of Roman legion infantry were eliminated. The governor of the province Gaius Suetonius Paulinus assembled his remaining forces and defeated the Britons. Although order was restored for some time Nero considered abandoning the province.125 Julius Classicianus replaced the former procurator Catus Decianus and Classicianus advised Nero to replace Paulinus who continued to punish the population even after the rebellion was over.126 Nero decided to adopt a more lenient approach by appointing a new governor Petronius Turpilianus.127 Peace with Parthia Further information RomanParthian War of 5863 Nero began preparing for war in the early years of his reign after the Parthian king Vologeses set his brother Tiridates on the Armenian throne. Around AD 57 and AD 58 Domitius Corbulo and his legions advanced on Tiridates and captured the Armenian capital Artaxata. Tigranes was chosen to replace Tiridates on the Armenian throne. When Tigranes attacked Adiabene Nero had to send further legions to defend Armenia and Syria from Parthia. The Roman victory came at a time when the Parthians were troubled by revolts when this was dealt with they were able to devote resources to the Armenian situation. A Roman army under Paetus surrendered under humiliating circumstances and though both Roman and Parthian forces withdrew from Armenia it was under Parthian control. The triumphal arch for Corbulos earlier victory was partbuilt when Parthian envoys arrived in AD 63 to discuss treaties. Given imperium over the eastern regions Corbulo organised his forces for an invasion but was met by this Parthian delegation. An agreement was thereafter reached with the Parthians Rome would recognize Tiridates as king of Armenia only if he agreed to receive his diadem from Nero. A coronation ceremony was held in Italy AD 66. Dio reports that Tiridates said I have come to you my God worshiping you as Mithras. Shotter says this parallels other divine designations that were commonly applied to Nero in the East including The New Apollo and The New Sun. After the coronation friendly relations were established between Rome and the eastern kingdoms of Parthia and Armenia. Artaxata was temporarily renamed Neroneia.128129 First Jewish War Main article First JewishRoman War In 66 there was a Jewish revolt in Judea stemming from Greek and Jewish religious tension.130 In 67 Nero dispatched Vespasian to restore order.131 This revolt was eventually put down in 70 after Neros death.132 This revolt is famous for Romans breaching the walls of Jerusalem and destroying the Second Temple of Jerusalem.133 Pursuits Nero studied poetry music painting and sculpture. He both sang and played the cithara a type of lyre. Many of these disciplines were standard education for the Roman elite but Neros devotion to music exceeded what was socially acceptable for a Roman of his class.134 Ancient sources were critical of Neros emphasis on the arts chariotracing and athletics. Pliny described Nero as an actoremperor scaenici imperatoris and Suetonius wrote that he was carried away by a craze for popularity...since he was acclaimed as the equal of Apollo in music and of the Sun in driving a chariot he had planned to emulate the exploits of Hercules as well.6153 In AD 67 Nero participated in the Olympics. He had bribed organizers to postpone the games for a year so he could participate135 and artistic competitions were added to the athletic events. Nero won every contest in which he was a competitor. During the games Nero sang and played his lyre on stage acted in tragedies and raced chariots. He won a 
10 horse chariot race despite being thrown from the chariot and leaving the race. He was crowned on the basis that he would have won if he had completed the race. After he died a year later his name was removed from the list of winners.136 Champlin writes that though Neros participation effectively stifled true competition Nero seems to have been oblivious of reality.615455 Nero established the Neronian games in AD 60. Modeled on Greek style games these games included musical gymnastic and equestrian contests. According to Suetonius the gymnastic contests were held in the Saepta area of the Campus Martius.61288 Historiography Further information Nero in the arts and popular culture The history of Neros reign is problematic in that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with Nero. These first histories while they still existed were described as biased and fantastical either overly critical or praising of Nero.137 The original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events.138 Nonetheless these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Nero written by the next generations of historians.139 A few of the contemporary historians are known by name. Fabius Rusticus Cluvius Rufus and Pliny the Elder all wrote condemning histories on Nero that are now lost.140 There were also proNero histories but it is unknown who wrote them or for what deeds Nero was praised.141 The bulk of what is known of Nero comes from Tacitus Suetonius and Cassius Dio who were all of the upper classes. Tacitus and Suetonius wrote their histories on Nero over 50 years after his death while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 150 years after Neros death. These sources contradict one another on a number of events in Neros life including the death of Claudius the death of Agrippina and the Roman fire of AD 64 but they are consistent in their condemnation of Nero. Cassius Dio Cassius Dio c. 155229 was the son of Cassius Apronianus a Roman senator. He passed the greater part of his life in public service. He was a senator under Commodus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Septimius Severus and afterwards suffect consul around 205 and also proconsul in Africa and Pannonia.142 Books 6163 of Dios Roman History describe the reign of Nero. Only fragments of these books remain and what does remain was abridged and altered by John Xiphilinus an 
11 thcentury monk.citation needed Dio Chrysostom Dio Chrysostom c. 40120 a Greek philosopher and historian wrote the Roman people were very happy with Nero and would have allowed him to rule indefinitely. They longed for his rule once he was gone and embraced imposters when they appeared Indeed the truth about this has not come out even yet for so far as the rest of his subjects were concerned there was nothing to prevent his continuing to be Emperor for all time seeing that even now everybody wishes he were still alive. And the great majority do believe that he still is although in a certain sense he has died not once but often along with those who had been firmly convinced that he was still alive.143 Epictetus Epictetus c. 55135 was the slave to Neros scribe Epaphroditos.144 He makes a few passing negative comments on Neros character in his work but makes no remarks on the nature of his rule. He describes Nero as a spoiled angry and unhappy man.145 Josephus The historian Josephus c. 37100 while calling Nero a tyrant was also the first to mention bias against Nero. Of other historians he said A circa 
18 thcentury woodcut of the historian Josephus c. 37100 who accused other historians of slandering Nero. But I omit any further discourse about these affairs for there have been a great many who have composed the history of Nero some of which have departed from the truth of facts out of favour as having received benefits from him while others out of hatred to him and the great illwill which they bore him have so impudently raved against him with their lies that they justly deserve to be condemned. Nor do I wonder at such as have told lies of Nero since they have not in their writings preserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier than his time even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred since those writers lived a long time after them.146 Lucan Although more of a poet than a historian Lucanus c. 3965 has one of the kindest accounts of Neros rule. He writes of peace and prosperity under Nero in contrast to previous war and strife. Ironically he was later involved in a conspiracy to overthrow Nero and was executed.147 Philostratus Philostratus II the Athenian c. 172250 spoke of Nero in the Life of Apollonius Tyana Books 45. Although he has a generally bad or dim view of Nero he speaks of others positive reception of Nero in the East.citation needed Pliny the Elder The history of Nero by Pliny the Elder c. 2479 did not survive. Still there are several references to Nero in Plinys Natural Histories. Pliny has one of the worst opinions of Nero and calls him an enemy of mankind.148 Plutarch Plutarch c. 46127 mentions Nero indirectly in his account of the Life of Galba and the Life of Otho as well as in the Vision of Thespesius in Book 7 of the Moralia where a voice orders that Neros soul be transferred to a more offensive species.149 Nero is portrayed as a tyrant but those that replace him are not described as better. Seneca the Younger It is not surprising that Seneca c. 4 BCAD 65 Neros teacher and advisor writes very well of Nero.150 Suetonius Main article Lives of the Twelve Caesars Suetonius c. 69130 was a member of the equestrian order and he was the head of the department of the imperial correspondence. While in this position Suetonius started writing biographies of the emperors accentuating the anecdotal and sensational aspects. By this account Nero raped the vestal virgin Rubria.151 Tacitus Main article Annals Tacitus The Annals by Tacitus c. 56117 is the most detailed and comprehensive history on the rule of Nero despite being incomplete after the year AD 66. Tacitus described the rule of the JulioClaudian emperors as generally unjust. He also thought that existing writing on them was unbalanced The histories of Tiberius Caius Claudius and Nero while they were in power were falsified through terror and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred.152 Tacitus was the son of a procurator who married into the elite family of Agricola. He entered his political life as a senator after Neros death and by Tacitus own admission owed much to Neros rivals. Realising that this bias may be apparent to others Tacitus protests that his writing is true.153 Girolamo Cardano In 1562 Girolamo Cardano published in Basel his Encomium Neronis which was one of the first historical references of the modern era to portray Nero in a positive light.154 In Jewish and Christian tradition Jewish tradition An Aggadah in the Talmud says that at the end of AD 66 conflict broke out between Greeks and Jews in Jerusalem and Caesarea. According to the Talmud during the Great Jewish Revolt Nero went to Jerusalem and shot arrows in all four directions. All the arrows landed in the city. He then asked a passing child to repeat the verse he had learned that day. The child responded I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel Ezekiel 25
14.1 55 Nero became terrified believing that God wanted the Second Temple to be destroyed but that he would punish the one to carry it out. Nero said He desires to lay waste His House and to lay the blame on me whereupon he fled and converted to Judaism to avoid such retribution.156 Vespasian was then dispatched to put down the rebellion. The Talmud adds that the sage Reb Meir Baal HaNess lived in the time of the Mishnah and was a prominent supporter of the Bar Kokhba rebellion against Roman rule. Rabbi Meir was considered one of the greatest of the Tannaim of the third generation 139163. According to the Talmud his father was a descendant of Nero who had converted to Judaism. His wife Bruriah is one of the few women cited in the Gemara. He is the thirdmostfrequentlymentioned sage in the Mishnah.citation needed The Talmudic legend about Nero is not supported by contemporary sources. Roman and Greek sources nowhere report Neros alleged trip to Jerusalem or his alleged conversion to Judaism.157 There is also no record of Nero having any offspring who survived infancy his only recorded child Claudia Augusta died aged 4 months. Christian tradition Neros Torches Henryk Siemiradzki Tacitus describes Nero extensively torturing and executing Christians after the fire of AD 
64.7 6 Suetonius also mentions Nero punishing Christians though he does so because they are given to a new and mischievous superstition and does not connect it with the fire.158 Christian writer Tertullian c. 155230 was the first to call Nero the first persecutor of Christians. He wrote Examine your records. There you will find that Nero was the first that persecuted this doctrine.159 Lactantius c. 240320 also said that Nero first persecuted the servants of God160 as did Sulpicius Severus.161 However Suetonius writes that since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus the emperor Claudius expelled them from Rome Iudaeos impulsore Chresto assidue tumultuantis Roma expulit.162 These expelled Jews may have been early Christians although Suetonius is not explicit. Nor is the Bible explicit calling Aquila of Pontus and his wife Priscilla both expelled from Italy at the time Jews Acts 1
82.1 63 Martyrdoms of Peter and Paul The first text to suggest that Nero ordered the execution of an apostle is a letter by Clement to the Corinthians traditionally dated to around AD 
96.1 64 The apocryphal Ascension of Isaiah a Christian writing from the 
2 nd century says the slayer of his mother who himself even this king will persecute the plant which the Twelve Apostles of the Beloved have planted. Of the Twelve one will be delivered into his hands this is interpreted as referring to Nero.165 Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea c. 275339 was the first to write explicitly that Paul was beheaded and Peter crucified in Rome during the reign of Nero.166 He states that Neros persecution led to Peter and Pauls deaths but that Nero did not give any specific orders. However several other accounts going back to the first century have Paul surviving his two years in Rome and travelling to Hispania before facing trial in Rome again prior to his death.167 Peter is first said to have been crucified specifically upsidedown in Rome during Neros reign but not by Nero in the apocryphal Acts of Peter c. 2
00.1 68 The account ends with Paul still alive and Nero abiding by Gods command not to persecute any more Christians. By the fourth century a number of writers were stating that Nero killed Peter and Paul.160169 Antichrist Main articles Antichrist The Beast Revelation Number of the beast and Nero Redivivus legend The Sibylline Oracles Book 5 and 8 written in the second century speak of Nero returning and bringing destruction.170171 Within Christian communities these writings along with others172 fueled the belief that Nero would return as the Antichrist. In 310 Lactantius wrote that Nero suddenly disappeared and even the burial place of that noxious wild beast was nowhere to be seen. This has led some persons of extravagant imagination to suppose that having been conveyed to a distant region he is still reserved alive and to him they apply the Sibylline verses. Lactantius maintains that it is not right to believe this.160173 In 422 Augustine of Hippo wrote about 2 Thessalonians 2111 where he believed that Paul mentioned the coming of the Antichrist. Although he rejects the theory Augustine mentions that many Christians believed Nero was the Antichrist or would return as the Antichrist. He wrote that in saying For the mystery of iniquity doth already work174 he alluded to Nero whose deeds already seemed to be as the deeds of Antichrist.119 Some modern biblical scholars175176 such as Delbert Hillers Johns Hopkins University of the American Schools of Oriental Research and the editors of the Oxford Study Bible and HarperCollins Study Bible contend that the number 666 in the Book of Revelation is a code for Nero177 a view that is also supported in Roman Catholic Biblical commentaries.178179 The statement concerns Revelation 17118 the longest explanatory passage in Revelation180 which predicts the destruction of Rome by work of an eighth emperor who was also one of the seven kings of the most extended and powerful empire ever known in the human history according to this lecture Babylon the Great is identified with Rome181 which has poured the blood of saints and martyrs verse 6 and subsequently become the seat of the Vatican State reigning over all the kings existing on Earth. See also List of Roman emperors Notes  Tacitus wrote the following about Agrippinas marriage to Claudius From this moment the country was transformed. Complete obedience was accorded to a womanand not a woman like Messalina who toyed with national affairs. This was a rigorous almost masculine despotism. In public Agrippina was austere and often arrogant. Her private life was chasteunless power was to be gained. Her passion to acquire money was unbounded she wanted it as a stepping stone to supremacy.8  The date is recorded in the Acta Arvalia9 and the year was in the consulate of Gaius Antistius and Marcus Suillius.10 Suetonius states that Nero was in the eleventh year of his age which is most likely a mistake.11  For further information see adoption in Rome.  Suetonius wrote That Claudius was poisoned is the general belief but when it was done and by whom is disputed. Some say that it was his taster the eunuch Halotus as he was banqueting on the Citadel with the priests others that at a family dinner Agrippina served the drug to him with her own hand in mushrooms a dish of which he was extravagantly fond.. His death was kept quiet until all the arrangements were made about the succession.17  Sources describe Acte as a slave girl Shotter and a freedwoman Champlin and Scullard.
