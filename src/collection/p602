He reigned for seven to eight years in the early 
25 th century BC during the Old Kingdom period. He probably belonged to a branch of the Fourth Dynasty royal family although his parentage is uncertain he could have been the son of Khentkaus I. He had at least one daughter and very probably a son Sahure with his consort Neferhetepes. This son succeeded him as pharaoh. His reign heralded the ascendancy of the cult of Ra who effectively became Egypts state god during the Fifth Dynasty. Userkaf may have been a highpriest of Ra before ascending the throne and built a sun temple known as the Nekhenre between Abusir and Abu Gurab. In doing so he instituted a tradition followed by his successors over a period of 80 years. The Nekhenre mainly functioned as a mortuary temple for the setting sun. Rites performed in the temple were primarily concerned with Ras creator function and his role as father of the king. Taken with the reduction in the size of the royal mortuary complex this suggests a more concrete separation between the sun god and the king than in the preceding dynasties. After Userkafs death his temple was the subject of four building phases during which it acquired a large obelisk. Column of Userkaf found at the temple of Montu ElTod Userkaf built a pyramid in Saqqara close to that of Djoser a location that forced architects to put the associated mortuary temple in an unusual position to the south of the pyramid. The latter was much smaller than those built during the Fourth Dynasty but the mortuary complex was lavishly and extensively decorated with fine painted reliefs. In addition to his own pyramid and temple Userkaf built a smaller pyramid close to his for one of his queens likely Neferhetepes. Although Userkaf was the object of a funerary cult after his death like the other Fifth Dynasty kings his was relatively unimportant and was abandoned after the end of the dynasty. Little is known of his activities beyond the construction of his pyramid and sun temple. The Old Kingdom royal annals record offerings of beer bread and lands to various gods some of which may correspond to building projects on Userkafs behalf including the temple of Montu in ElTod where he is the earliest attested pharaoh. Beyond the borders of Egypt a military expedition to Canaan or the Eastern Desert may have taken place and trade contacts with the Aegean seem to have existed at the time. citation needed Familyedit See also Fourth Dynasty of Egypt family tree Parents and consortedit The identity of Userkafs parents is uncertain but he undoubtedly had family connections with the rulers of the preceding Fourth Dynasty.92526 Egyptologist Miroslav Verner proposes that he was a son of Menkaure by one of his secondary queensnote 2 and possibly a full brother to his predecessor and the last king of the Fourth Dynasty Shepseskaf.2728 Alternatively Nicolas Grimal Peter Clayton and Michael Rice propose that Userkaf was the son of a Neferhetepes2930 whom Grimal Giovanna Magi and Rice see as a daughter of Djedefre and Hetepheres II.233132 The identity of Neferhetepess husband in this hypothesis is unknown but Grimal conjectures that he may have been the priest of Ra lord of Sakhebu mentioned in Westcar papyrus.note 334 Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton propose that Neferhetepes was buried in the pyramid next to that of Userkafnote 4 which is believed to have belonged to a woman of the same name.note 535 Portrait of Khentkaus I from her tomb The location of the pyramid attributed to Neferhetepes however strongly suggests that she may instead have been Userkafs wife. If so she should be identified with the Neferhetepes who is the mother of Userkafs successor and likely son Sahure.35 A relief from Sahures causeway depicts this king and his queen together with the kings mother identified as a Neferhetepes which very likely makes her Userkafs wife.37 Like Grimal Jaromr Malek sees her as a daughter of Djedefre and Hetepheres II.25 Following this hypothesis Mark Lehner also suggests that Userkafs mother may have been Khentkaus I an idea shared by Arielle Kozloff.1538 Dodson and Hilton argue that Neferhetepes is not given the title of kings wife in later documents pertaining to her mortuary cult although they note that this absence is inconclusive.35 They propose that Userkafs queen may have been Khentkaus I a hypothesis shared by Selim Hassan.3539 Clayton and Rosalie and Anthony David concur further positing that Khentkaus I was Menkaures daughter.4041 Bernhard Grdseloff argues that Userkaf as a descendant of pharaoh Djedefre marrying a woman from the main royal linethat of Khafre and Menkaurecould have unified two rival factions within the royal family and ended possible dynastic struggles.1242 Alternatively Userkaf could have been the high priest of Ra before ascending the throne giving him sufficient influence to marry Shepseskafs widow in the person of Khentkaus I.note 64950 Childrenedit Many Egyptologists including Verner Zemina David and Baker believe that Sahure was Userkafs son rather than his brother as suggested by the Westcar papyrus.5152 The main evidence is a relief showing Sahure and his mother Neferhetepes this being also the name of the queen who is believed to have owned the pyramid next to Userkafs.37 An additional argument supporting the filiation of Sahure is the location of his pyramid in close proximity to Userkafs sun temple.53 No other child of Userkaf has been identified except a daughter named Khamaat mentioned in inscriptions uncovered in the mastaba of Ptahshepses.54 Reignedit Cartouche of Userkaf on the Abydos king list Durationedit The exact duration of Userkafs reign is unknown. Given the historical and archeological evidence the consensus among Egyptologists is that he ruled for seven to eight years11555657 at the start of Egypts Fifth Dynasty.15 First an analysis of the nearly contemporaneous Old Kingdom royal annals shows that Userkafs reign was recorded on eight compartments corresponding to at least seven full years but not much more.note 760 The latest legible year recorded on the annals for Userkaf is that of his third cattle count to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied on the population. This significant event is believed to have been biennial during the Old Kingdom period meaning that the third cattle count represents the sixth year of his reign. The same count is also attested in a masons inscription found on a stone of Userkafs sun temple.note 861 Second Userkaf is given a reign of seven years on the third column row 17 of the Turin Royal Canon67 a document copied during the reign of Ramesses II from earlier sources.68 Third very few small artefacts bearing Userkafs name have been found witnessing a short reign. These include a gold mounted diorite jar69 a fivedeben stone weight70 and a stone cylinder seal from Elephantine now all in the Metropolitan Museum of Art as well as an ivory cylinder seal in the British Museum71 and yet another seal in the Bulaq Museum.7273 The only historical source favouring a longer reign is the Aegyptiaca  a history of Egypt written in the 
3 rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II 283246 BC by Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. According to the Byzantine scholar George Syncellus Africanus wrote that the Aegyptiaca mentioned the succession Userchers  Sephrs  Neferchers at the start of the Fifth Dynasty. Userchers Sephrs and Neferchers are believed to be the Hellenized forms for Userkaf Sahure and Neferirkare respectively.74 In particular Manethos reconstruction of the early Fifth Dynasty is in agreement with those given on the Abydos king list and the Saqqara Tablet two lists of kings written during the reigns of Seti I and Ramesses II respectively.75 In contrast with the Turin canon Africanuss report of the Aegyptiaca estimates that Userkaf reigned for 28 years74 much longer than the modern consensus.11555657 Founder of the Fifth Dynastyedit The Westcar papyrus on display in the gyptisches Museum dates to the 
17 th Dynasty but its story was possibly first written during the 
12 th Dynasty.76 The division of ancient Egyptian kings into dynasties is an invention of Manethos Aegyptiaca intended to adhere more closely to the expectations of Manethos patrons the Greek rulers of Ptolemaic Egypt.77 A distinction between the Fourth and Fifth dynasties may nonetheless have been recognised by the ancient Egyptians as recorded by a much older tradition25 found in the tale of the Westcar papyrus. In this story King Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty is foretold the demise of his line and the rise of a new dynasty through the accession of three brothers sons of Ra to the throne of Egypt. This tale dates to the Seventeenth or possibly the Twelfth Dynasty.76 Beyond such historical evidence the division between the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties seems to reflect actual changes taking place at the time in particular in Egyptian religion and in the kings role.78 Ras primacy over the rest of the Egyptian pantheon and the increased royal devotion given to him made Ra a sort of stategod5679 a novelty in comparison with the Fourth Dynasty when more emphasis was put on royal burials.9 Userkafs position before ascending to the throne is unknown. Grimal states that he could have been a highpriest of Ra in Heliopolis or Sakhebu a cultcenter of Ra mentioned in the Westcar papyrus.2180 The hypothesis of a connection between the origins of the Fifth Dynasty and Sakhebu was first proposed by the Egyptologist Flinders Petrie who noted that in Egyptian hieroglyphs the name of Sakhebu resembles that of Elephantine the city that Manetho gives as the cradle of the Fifth Dynasty. According to Petrie positing that the Westcar papyrus records a tradition that remembered the origins of the Fifth Dynasty could explain Manethos records especially given that there is otherwise no particular connection between Elephantine and Fifth Dynasty pharaohs.80 Activities in Egyptedit Cylinder seal of Userkaf reading Userkaf beloved of the gods beloved of Hathornote 98082 Beyond the constructions of his mortuary complex and sun temple little is known of Userkaf.3 Malek says his short reign may indicate that he was elderly upon becoming pharaoh.83 Verner sees Userkafs reign as significant in that it marks the apex of the sun cultnote 10 the pharaonic title of Son of Ra becoming systematic from his reign onwards.86 In Upper Egypt Userkaf either commissioned3 or enlarged55 the temple of Montu at Tod where he is the earliest attested pharaoh.87 Due to structural alterations in particular during the early Middle Kingdom New Kingdom and Ptolemaic periods little of Userkafs original temple has survived.88 It was a small mudbrick chapel including a granite pillar88 inscribed with the name of the king.89 Further domestic activities may be inferred from the annals of the Old Kingdom written during Neferirkares or Nyuserres reign.note 119192 They record that Userkaf gave endowments for the gods of Heliopolisnote 12 in the second and sixth yearsnote 13 of his reign as well as to the gods of Buto in his sixth year both of which may have been destined for building projects on Userkafs behalf.3 In the same vein the annals record a donation of land to Horus during Userkafs sixth year on the throne this time explicitly mentioning building Horus temple.95 Other gods honoured by Userkaf include Ra and Hathor both of whom received land donations recorded in the annals9396 as well as Nekhbet Wadjet the gods of the divine palace of Upper Egypt and the gods of the estate Djebaty who received bread beer and land. Finally a fragmentary piece of text in the annals suggests that Min might also have benefited from Userkafs donations.95 Further evidence for religious activities taking place at the time is given by a royal decree97 found in the mastaba of the administration official Nykaankh buried at Tihna alJabal in Middle Egypt.21 By this decree Userkaf donates and reforms several royal domains for the maintenance of the cult of Hathor97 and installs Nykaankh as priest of this cult.98 Excavations of the pyramid temple of Amenemhat I at Lisht produced a block decorated with a relief bearing the titulary of Userkaf. The block had been reused as a building material. The relief mentions a journey of the king to the temple of Bastet in a ship called He who controls the subjects ....99 While Userkaf chose Saqqara to build his pyramid complex officials at the time including the vizier Seshathotep Heti continued to build their tombs in the Giza necropolis.3 Trade and military activitiesedit Stone vessel from Kythira bearing the name of Userkafs sun temple27 Userkafs reign might have witnessed the birth of direct trade between Egypt and its Aegean neighbors as shown by a series of reliefs from his mortuary temple representing ships engaged in what may be a naval expedition.46100 Further evidence for such contacts is a stone vessel bearing the name of his sun temple that was uncovered on the Greek island of Kythira.27 This vase is the earliest evidence of commercial contacts between Egypt and the Aegean world. Finds in Anatolia dating to the reigns of Menkauhor Kaiu and Djedkare Isesi demonstrate that these contacts continued throughout the Fifth Dynasty.55 South of Egypt101 Userkaf launched a military expedition into Nubia27 while the Old Kingdom annals record that he received tribute from a region that is either the Eastern Desert or Canaan in the form of a workforce of one chieftain and 70 foreigners102 likely women93103 as well as 303 pacified rebels destined to work on Userkafs pyramid.104 These might have been prisoners from another military expedition to the east of Egypt3 or rebels exiled from Egypt prior to Userkafs second year on the throne and now willing to reintegrate into Egyptian society.105 According to the Egyptologist Hartwig Altenmller these people might have been punished following dynastic struggles connected with the end of the Fourth Dynasty.102 Finally some reliefs from Userkafs mortuary temple depict a successful military venture106 against Asiatic Bedouins whom Userkaf is shown smiting107 as well as a naval expedition.108109 Statuaryedit Fragment of an alabaster statue of Userkaf from his sun temple now at the Egyptian Museum of Berlin110 Several fragmentary statues of Userkaf have been uncovered. These include a bust of the goddess Neith in his likeness111 found in his sun temple at Abusir now in the Egyptian Museum. This head of Userkaf is 45 cm 18 in high and carved from greywacke stone. It is considered particularly important as it is among the very few sculptures in the round from the Old Kingdom that show the monarch wearing the Deshret of Lower Egypt.note 14 The head was uncovered in 1957 during the joint excavation expedition of the German and Swiss Institutes of Cairo. Another head which might belong to Userkaf wearing the Hedjet of Upper Egypt and made of painted limestone is in the Cleveland Museum of Art.note 1517111 The head of a colossal largerthanlife sphinx statue of Userkaf now in the Egyptian Museum was found in the temple courtyard of his mortuary complex at Saqqara by Cecil Mallaby Firth in 19
28.1 13 This colossal head of pink Aswan granite shows the king wearing the nemes headdress with a cobra on his forehead.440 It is the largest surviving head dating to the Old Kingdom other than that of the Great Sphinx of Giza40 and the only colossal royal statue from this period.4 Many more fragments of statues of the king made of diorite slate and granite but none of limestone have been found at the same site.113114 Some bore Userkafs cartouche and Horus name.114 Kozloff notes the youthful features of Userkaf on most of his representations and concludes that if these are good indications of his age then he might have come to the throne as an adolescent and died in his early twenties.114 Sun templeedit Main article Sun temple of Userkaf Layout of Userkafs sun temple after its completion by Sahure or Neferirkare Kakai 1. obelisk 2. obelisk pedestal 3. statue shrines 4. court open to the sun 5. altar 6. outbuilding 7. causeway 8. valley temple.115116 Significanceedit Userkaf is the first327 pharaoh to build a dedicated temple to the sun god Ra in the Memphite necropolis north of Abusir on a promontory on the desert edge14 just south of the modern locality of Abu Gurab.117 Works might have started during Userkafs fifth or sixth year of reign.38 The only plausible precedent for Userkafs sun temple was the temple associated with the Great Sphinx of Giza which may have been dedicated to Ra and may thus have served similar purposes.116 In any case Userkafs successors for the next 80 years followed his course of action83 sun temples were built by all subsequent Fifth Dynasty pharaohs until Menkauhor Kaiu with the possible118 exception of Shepseskare whose reign might have been too short to build one.119 Userkafs choice of Abusir as the site of his sun temple has not been satisfactorily explained120 the site being of no particular significance up to that point.note 16121 Userkafs choice maynote 17 have influenced subsequent kings of the Fifth Dynasty who made Abusir the royal necropolis until the reign of Menkauhor Kaiu.125 For the Egyptologist Hans Goedicke Userkafs decision to build a temple for the setting sun separated from his own mortuary complex is a manifestation of and response to sociopolitical tensions if not turmoil at the end of the Fourth Dynasty.78 The construction of the sun temple permitted a distinction between the kings personal afterlife and religious issues pertaining to the setting sun which had been so closely intertwined in the pyramid complexes of Giza and in the pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty.126 Thus Userkafs pyramid would be isolated in Saqqara not even surrounded by a wider cemetery for his contemporaries while the sun temple would serve the social need for a solar cult which while represented by the king would not be exclusively embodied by him anymore.126 Malek similarly sees the construction of sun temples as marking a shift from the royal cult which was so preponderant during the early Fourth Dynasty to the cult of the sun god Ra. A result of these changes is that the king was now primarily revered as the son of Ra.56 Nameedit The ancient Egyptians called Userkafs sun temple Nekhenre Nn R.w which has been variously translated as The fortress of Ra The stronghold of Ra The residence of Ra3 Ras storerooms and The birthplace of Ra.127 According to Coppens Jank Lehner Verner Vymazalov Wilkinson and Zemina Nn here might actually refer instead to the town of Nekhen also known as Hierakonpolis.14116121127 Hierakonpolis was a stronghold and seat of power for the late predynastic kings who unified Egypt. They propose that Userkaf may have chosen this name to emphasise the victorious and unifying nature of the cult of Ra128129 or at least to represent some symbolic meaning in relation to kingship.127 Nekhen was also the name of an institution responsible for providing resources to the living king as well as to his funerary cult after his death.129 In consequence the true meaning of Nekhenre might be closer to Ras Nekhen or The Hierakonpolis of Ra.127 Functionedit The Abusir Papyri indicate that the cults taking place at the sun temple and mortuary complex of the king were closely related.129 The sun temple of Userkaf first appears as pyramid XVII in Karl Richard Lepsius pioneering list of pyramids in the mid
19 th century.130131 Its true nature was recognised by Ludwig Borchardt in the early 
20 th century but it was only thoroughly excavated from 1954 until 1957 by a team including Hanns Stock Werner Kaiser Peter Kaplony Wolfgang Helck and Herbert Ricke.132133 According to the royal annals the construction of the temple started in Userkafs fifth year on the throne and on that occasion he donated 24 royal domains for the maintenance of the temple.134 Userkafs sun temple covered an area of 44 m  83 m 144 ft  272 ft133 and was oriented to the west. It served primarily as a place of worship for the mortuary cult of Ra135 and was supposed to relate it to the royal funerary cult.2 Structurally the sun temple and the royal mortuary complex were very similar136 as they included a valley temple close to the Nile and a causeway leading up to the high temple on the desert plateau. In other ways their architectures differed. For example the valley temple of the sun temple complex is not oriented to any cardinal point rather pointing vaguely137 to Heliopolis and the causeway is not aligned with the axis of the high temple. The Abusir Papyri a collection of administrative documents from later in the Fifth Dynasty indicates that the cultic activities taking place in the sun and mortuary temples were related for instance offerings for both cults were dispatched from the sun temple.129 In fact sun temples built during this period were meant to play for Ra the same role that the pyramid played for the king. They were funerary temples for the sun god where his renewal and rejuvenation necessary to maintain the order of the world could take place. Rites performed in the temple were thus primarily concerned with Ras creator function as well as his role as father of the king. During his lifetime the king would appoint his closest officials to the running of the temple allowing them to benefit from the temples income and thus ensuring their loyalty. After the pharaohs death the sun temples income would be associated with the pyramid complex supporting the royal funerary cult.138 Construction works on the Nekhenre did not stop with Userkafs death but continued in at least four building phases the first of which may have taken place under Sahure139 and then under his successors Neferirkare Kakai and Nyuserre Ini.116140 By the end of Userkafs rule the sun temple did not yet house the large granite obelisk on a pedestal that it would subsequently acquire. Instead its main temple seems to have comprised a rectangular enclosure wall with a high mast set on a mound in its center possibly as a perch for the sun gods falcon.116 To the east of this mound was a mudbrick altar with statue shrines on both sides.141 According to the royal annals from his sixth year on the throne Userkaf commanded that two oxen and two geese were to be sacrificed daily in the Nekhenre.95116 These animals seem to have been butchered in or around the high temple the causeway being wide enough to lead live oxen up it.137 In addition to these sacrifices Userkaf endowed his sun temple with vast agricultural estates amounting to 34655 acres 14024 ha of land38 which Klaus Baer describes as an enormous and quite unparalleled gift for the Old Kingdom.142 Kozloff sees these decisions as a manifestation of Userkafs young age and of the power of the priesthood of Ra rather than as a result of his personal devotion to the sun god.38 Pyramid complexedit Main article Pyramid of Userkaf The ruined pyramid of Userkaf at Saqqara Pyramid of Userkafedit Locationedit Unlike most pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty Userkaf built a modest21 pyramid at North Saqqara at the northeastern edge of the enclosure wall surrounding Djosers pyramid complex.126143 This decision probably political2 may be connected to the return to the city of Memphis as center of government126 of which Saqqara to the west is the necropolis as well as a desire to rule according to principles and methods closer to Djosers.126 In particular like Djosers and unlike the pyramid complexes of Giza Userkafs mortuary complex is not surrounded by a necropolis for his followers.126 For Goedicke the wider religious role played by Fourth Dynasty pyramids was now to be played by the sun temple while the kings mortuary complex was to serve only the kings personal funerary needs.126 Hence Userkafs choice of Saqqara is a manifestation of a return to a harmonious and altruistic126 notion of kingship which Djoser seemed to have symbolized against that represented by Khufu who had almost personally embodied the sungod.note 18122 Pyramid architectureedit Userkafs pyramid complex was called WabIsut Userkaf meaning Pure are the places of Userkaf144 or Userkafs pyramid holiest of places.145 The pyramid originally reached a height of 49 m 161 ft for a baseside of 
73.3  m 240 ft.146 By volume this made it the second smallest kings pyramid finished during the Fifth Dynasty after that of the final ruler Unas.147 The reduced size of the pyramid as compared to those of Userkafs Fourth Dynasty predecessors owes much to the rise of the cult of Ra which diverted spiritual and financial resources away from the kings burial.111 The pyramid was built following techniques established during the Fourth Dynasty with a core made of stones rather than employing rubble as in subsequent pyramids of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties.148 The core was so poorly laid out however that once the pyramids outer casing of fine limestone had been robbed it crumbled into a heap of rubble.15 The burial chamber was lined with large limestone blocks its roof made of gabled limestone beams.15 Mortuary templeedit Relief from Userkafs mortuary temple originally painted The pyramids funerary complex is peculiar in that Userkafs mortuary temple is located on the southern side rather than the usual eastern one. This was almost certainly due to the presence of a large moat surrounding Djosers pyramid and running to the east as proposed by Verner149 or to the general topography of Saqqara and the presence of older tombs in the vicinity as expounded by Edwards and Lauer. In any case this means that Userkaf chose to be buried in close proximity to Djoser even though this implied that he could not use the normal layout for his temple.149 Rainer Stadelmann believes that the reason for the choices of location and layout were practical and due to the presence of the necropoliss administrative center on the northeast corner of Djosers complex.36 Verner rather identifies a desire on Userkafs behalf to benefit from the religious significance of Djosers complex.36 Alternatively Userkafs decision to locate the temple on the pyramids southern side may be motivated by entirely religious reasons with the Egyptologists Herbert Ricke and Richard H. Wilkinson proposing that it could have ensured the temples yearround exposure to the sun36150 while Altenmller suggests it was aligned with an obelisk that could have been located nearby.36 The mortuary temple walls were extensively adorned with raised reliefs of exceptional quality.150151 Scant remains of pigments on some reliefs show that these reliefs were originally painted. Userkafs pyramid temple represents an important innovation in this respect he was the first pharaoh to introduce nature scenes in his funerary temple including scenes of hunting in the marshes that would subsequently become common.151 The artistic work is highly detailed with a single relief showing no less than seven different species of birds and a butterfly. Hunting scenes symbolised the victory of the king over the forces of chaos and might thus have illustrated Userkafs role as IryMaat that is the one who establishes Maat which was one of Userkafs names.151 The funerary complex of Userkaf was accessed from the Nile via a valley temple connected to the mortuary temple with a causeway. This valley temple is yet to be excavated.38 Pyramid complex of Neferhetepesedit Pyramidedit The funerary chamber of the queens pyramid exposed by stone robbers Some 10 m 33 ft to the south of Userkafs funerary enclosure there stands a separate pyramid complex built in all likelihood for one of his queens. The pyramid built on an eastwest axis is ruined and only a small mound of rubble can be seen today. Although no name has been identified in the pyramid proper its owner is believed by Egyptologists including Cecil Mallaby Firth Bernard Grdseloff Audran Labrousse fr JeanPhilippe Lauer and Tarek ElAwady to have been Neferhetepes mother of Sahure and in all probability Userkafs consort.152 The pyramid was originally some 17 m 56 ft high with a slope of 52 similar to that of Userkafs and a base 
26.2 5 m 
86.1  ft long.153 The core of the main and cult pyramids were built with the same technique consisting of three154 horizontal layers of roughly hewn local limestone blocks and gypsum mortar. The core was covered with an outer casing of fine Tura limestone now gone. The pyramid was so extensively used as a stone quarry that even its internal chambers are exposed. These chambers are a scaleddown version of those in Userkafs main pyramid but without storage rooms.153 Mortuary templeedit The queens pyramid complex had its own separate mortuary temple located on the pyramid eastern side. The temple entrance led to an open pillared courtyard stretching from east to west where the ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place. A sacrificial chapel adjoined the pyramid side and there were three statue niches and a few magazine chambers to store offerings.36 The temple halls were adorned with reliefs of animal processions and carriers of offerings moving towards the shrine of the queen.36 Legacyedit Funerary cultedit Old Kingdomedit Relief from a Saqqara tomb dating to the Ramesside Period showing from left to right Djoser Teti and Userkaf155 Like other Fourth and Fifth Dynasty pharaohs Userkaf received a funerary cult after his death. His cult was statesponsored and relied on goods for offerings produced in dedicated agricultural estates established during his lifetime as well as such resources as fabrics brought from the house of silver the treasury.156 The cult flourished in the early to midFifth Dynasty as evidenced by the tombs and seals of participating priests and officials such as Nykaure who served in the cults of Userkaf and Neferefre157 Nykaankh and Khnumhotep who served in Userkafs pyramid complex158 Ptahhotep a priest of the Nekhenre and of Userkafs mortuary temple159 Tepemankh160 Nenkheftka161 and Senuankh162163 who served in the cults of Userkaf and Sahure Pehenukai a vizier under Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai164 and Nykuhor a judge inspector of scribes privy councillor and priest of funerary cults of Userkaf and Neferefre.165166 Middle Kingdomedit The longterm importance of Userkafs official cult may be judged by its abandonment at the end of the Fifth Dynasty.55 In comparison the official funerary cult of at least one of Userkafs successors Nyuserre Ini may have lasted until the Middle Kingdom period.167168 The mortuary temple of Userkaf must have been in ruins or dismantled by the time of the Twelfth Dynasty as indicated for example by a block showing the king performing a ritual found reused as a construction material in the pyramid of Amenemhat I.169 Userkaf was not the only king whose mortuary temple met this fate Nyuserres temple was targeted even though its last priests were serving in it around this time. These facts hint at a lapse of royal interest in the statesponsored funerary cults of Old Kingdom rulers.170 Later periodsedit Examples of personal devotions on behalf of pious individuals endured much longer. For example Userkaf is depicted on a relief from the Saqqara tomb of the priest Mehu who lived during the Ramesside period c. 12921189 BCE.171172 Early in this period during the reign of Ramesses II Ramessess fourth son Khaemwaset fl. c. 12801225 BCE ordered restoration work on Userkafs pyramid as well as on other pyramids of the Fifth Dynasty. In the case of Userkaf this is established by inscriptions on stone cladding from the pyramid field showing Khaemwaset with offering bearers.173 The reliefs from Userkafs funerary complex were copied during the 
26 th Dynasty of the Late Period. A particular example is a relief showing Userkaf wearing a boatmans circlet with streamers and urae with the horns of an Atef crown a motif which had disappeared from Egyptian arts since Userkafs time.73 In contemporary cultureedit Egyptian Nobel Prize for Literaturelaureate Naguib Mahfouz published a short story in 1945 about Userkaf entitled Afw almalik Usirkaf uqsusa misriya. This short story was translated by Raymond Stock as King Userkafs Forgiveness in the collection of short stories Sawt min alalam alakhar whose title translates to Voices from the other world ancient Egyptian tales.174 Notes references and sourcesedit Notesedit  Proposed dates for Userkafs reign 25602553 BC1 25132506 BC234 25042496 BC5 24982491 BC6 24942487 BC789 24792471 BC10 24662458 BC11 24652458 BC1213141516 24542447 BC17 24542446 BC5 24352429 BC1819 23922385 BC20  The historians Rosalie and Anthony David concur stating that Userkaf belonged to a side branch of Khafras family.9  This papyrus now recognised as nonhistorical records a story according to which Userkaf is a son of the god Ra with a woman named Rededjet. In the story two of Userkafs brothers are said to rise to the throne after him displacing Khufus family from the throne.33  This queen is referred to as Neferhetepes Q in modern Egyptology to distinguish her from preceding women of the same name.35  The attribution of the pyramid to a queen named Neferhetepes is not certain and relies on indirect evidence in the form of an inscription mentioning the queen in the nearby tomb of Persen a priest of her funerary cult.36  Ludwig Borchardt expanded on the theory according to which Khentkaus I was Userkafs spouse by positing that Userkaf managed to take the throne at the unexpected death of Shepseskaf and before the legitimate heirs Sahure and Neferirkare were old enough to rule.42 This hypothesis has been conclusively invalidated by recent research which established 1 that there were two queens named Khentkaus the first being possibly Userkafs mother while the second was the mother of Nyuserre Ini434445 2 that Sahure is Userkafs son4647 and 3 that Neferirkare was the son of Sahure.48  Older analyses of the document by Breasted and Daressy had already established that Userkaf reigned 12 to 14 years58 or 12 to 13 years59 respectively.  Four mentions of the year of the fifth cattle count were also discovered on stone tablets from Userkafs sun temple61 which could indicate that Userkaf reigned for 10 years. However these inscriptions are incomplete. In particular the name of the king to whose reign they belong is lost and they might instead refer to Sahures rule62 or to Neferirkares63 rather than that of Userkaf.6465 The attribution of these inscriptions to either Sahure or Neferirkare is paramount in determining who completed Userkafs sun temple which was unfinished at his death.64 The tablets detail the division of labour during works on the Nekhenre.66  The seal was in the British Museum at the end of the 
19 th century its current location is unknown.81  Egyptologists including Jrgen von Beckerath rather consider Nyuserres reign as the peak of the solar cult84 but for Grimal this is exaggerated.85  The surviving fragments of the annal likely date to the much later 
25 th Dynasty fl. 760656 BCE but were certainly copied or compiled from Old Kingdom sources.90  More precisely to the Bas of Heliopolis.93  That is if cattle counts were indeed biennial. The annals state only that the donations happened in the years of the first and third cattle counts.94  With catalog number JE 902

79.2.1 7 This head of Userkaf closely resembles the depictions of Menkaure on his triads.111  Verner and Zemina report that some Egyptologists whom they do not name have proposed that Abusir was chosen as the southernmost point from which one may have been able to glimpse the sun above the obelisk of the religious center of Ra in Heliopolis.121 This observation is contested by Goedicke122 for whom the supposed proximity to Heliopolis for the choice of the site hardly played a role.123 Grimal instead conjectures that Abusir was chosen for its proximity to Sakhebu a locality some 10 km 
6.2  mi north of Abu Rawash which is mentioned in various sources such as the Westcar papyrus as a cult center of Ra and which may have been the home town of Userkafs father in the hypothesis that he was a grandson of Djedefre.21  Verner and Zemina are convinced that the presence of Userkafs sun temple in Abusir explains the subsequent development of the necropolis124 but Goedicke sees this only as a vague association leaving the choice of Abusir as royal necropolis inexplicable.120  Goedicke also notes that the line passing through Userkafs pyramid and sun temple also passes through the apex of Khufus pyramid in Giza an alignment which he believes must be intentional yet cannot explain.126 Referencesedit  Hayes 1978 p. 58.  a b c Verner 20
