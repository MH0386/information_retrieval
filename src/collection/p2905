22 nd Dynasty Sekhemkheperre Osorkon I was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the 
22 nd Dynasty. Osorkons territory included much of the Levant. The Osorkon Bust found at Byblos is one of the five Byblian royal inscriptions. Biographyedit According to the stela of Pasenhor Osorkon I was the son of Shoshenq I and his chief consort Karomama A1 and the second king of ancient Egypts 
22 nd Dynasty who ruled around 922 BC  887 BC. He succeeded his father Shoshenq I who probably died within a year of his successful 923 BC campaign against the Philistines and the kingdom of Israel. Osorkon Is reign is known for many temple building projects and was a long and prosperous period of Egypts history. His highest known date is a Year 33 date found on the bandage of Nakhtefmuts mummy which held a menattab necklace inscribed with Osorkon Is nomen and prenomen Osorkon Sekhemkheperre.2 This date can only belong to Osorkon I since no other early Dynasty 22 king ruled for close to 30 years until Osorkon II. Other mummy linens which belong to his reign include three separate bandages dating to his regnal years 11 12 and 23 on the mummy of Khonsmaakheru in Berlin. The bandages are anonymously dated but definitely belong to his reign because Khonsmaakheru wore leather bands that contained a menattab naming Osorkon I.3 Secondly no other king who ruled around Osorkon Is reign had a 
23 rd regnal year including Shoshenq I who died just before the beginning of his 
22 nd. While Manetho gives Osorkon I a reign of 15 years in his gyptiaca this is most likely an error for 35 years based on the evidence of the second Heb Sed bandage as Kenneth Kitchen notes. Osorkon Is throne name Sekhemkheperre means Powerful are the Manifestations of Re.4 Successionedit Although Osorkon I is thought to have been directly succeeded by his son Takelot I it is possible that another ruler Heqakheperre Shoshenq II intervened briefly between these two kings because Takelot I was a son of Osorkon I through Queen Tashedkhons a secondary wife of this king. In contrast Osorkon Is senior wife was Queen Maatkare B who may have been Shoshenq IIs mother. However Shoshenq II could also have been another son of Shoshenq I since the latter was the only other king to be mentioned in objects from Shoshenq IIs intact royal tomb at Tanis aside from Shoshenq II himself. These objects are inscribed with either Shoshenq Is praenomen Hedjkheperre Shoshenq though this is not certain as it requires reading the objects as a massive hieroglyphic text or Shoshenq Great Chief of the Meshwesh which was Shoshenq Is title before he became king. Since Derrys forensic examination of his mummy reveals him to be a man in his fifties upon his death Shoshenq II could have lived beyond Osorkons 
35 year reign and Takelot Is 
13 year reign to assume the throne for a few years. An argument against this hypothesis is that most kings of the period were commonly named after their grandfathers and not their fathers. While the British scholar Kenneth A. Kitchen views Shoshenq II to be the high priest of Amun at Thebes Shoshenq C5 and a shortlived coregent of Osorkon I who predeceased his father the German Egyptologist Jrgen von Beckerath in his 1997 book Chronologie des Pharaonischen gypten maintains that Shoshenq II was rather an independent king of Tanis who ruled the 
22 nd Dynasty in his own right for about two years.6 Von Beckeraths hypothesis is supported by Shoshenq IIs employment of a complete royal titulary along with a distinct prenomen Heqakheperre and his intact tomb at Tanis was filled with numerous treasures including jeweled pectorals and bracelets an impressive falconheaded silver coffin and a gold face maskitems which indicate a genuine king of the 
22 nd Dynasty. More significantly however no mention of Osorkon Is name was preserved on any ushabtis jars jewelry or other objects within Shoshenq IIs tomb. This situation would be improbable if he was indeed Osorkon Is son and was buried by his father as Kitchens chronology suggests. These facts taken together imply that Sheshonq II ruled on his own accord at Tanis and was not a mere coregent. Manethos Epitome states that 3 Kings for 25 years separate Osorkon I from a Takelot Takelothis.7 This could be an error on Manethos part or an allusion to Shoshenq IIs reign. It may also be a reference to the recently discovered early Dynasty 22 king Tutkheperre whose existence is now corroborated by an architectural block from the Great Temple of Bubastis where Osorkon I and Osorkon II are well attested monumentally.8 Osorkon Is reign in Egypt was peaceful and uneventful however both his son and grandson Takelot I and Osorkon II respectively later encountered difficulties controlling Thebes and Upper Egypt within their own reigns since they had to deal with a rival king Harsiese A. Osorkon Is tomb has never been found.
