High Priest of Amun m nr tpj n jmn in hieroglyphs Era New Kingdom 15501069 BC The High Priest of Amun or First Prophet of Amun m nr tpj n jmn was the highestranking priest in the priesthood of the ancient Egyptian god Amun.1 The first high priests of Amun appear in the New Kingdom of Egypt at the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Historyedit The priesthood of Amun rose in power during the early Eighteenth dynasty through significant tributes to the god Amun by rulers such as Hatshepsut and more importantly Thutmose III.2 The Amun priesthood in Thebes had four highranking priests3 The Chief Prophet of Amun at Karnak m nr tpj n jmn also referred to as the Chief Priest of Amun. The Second Prophet of Amun at Karnak m nr snnw n jmn also referred to as the Second Priest of Amun. The Third Prophet of Amun at Karnak m nr mtnw n jmn khemetnu also referred to as the Third Priest of Amun. The Fourth Prophet of Amun at Karnak m nr jfdw n jmn also referred to as the Fourth Priest of Amun. The power of the Amun priesthood was temporarily curtailed during the Amarna period. A high priest named Maya is recorded in year 4 of Akhenaten. Akhenaten had the name of Amun removed from monuments during his reign as well as the names of several other deities. After his death Amun was restored to his place of prominence among the cults in Egypt. The young pharaoh Tutankhaten changed his name to Tutankhamun to signal the restoration of Amun to his former place of prominence.4 The Theban High Priest of Amun was appointed by the King. It was not uncommon for the position to be held by dignitaries who held additional posts in the pharaohs administration. Several of the high priests from the time of Ramesses II also served as Vizier.5 At the end of the New Kingdom the Twentieth Dynasty priesthood of Amun is for a large part dominated by Ramessesnakht. His son Amenhotep eventually succeeded his father and found himself in conflict with the Viceroy of Kush Pinehesy. Pinehesy took his troops north and besieged Thebes. After this period generals by the name of Herihor and Piankh served as High Priest. Herihor By the time Herihor was proclaimed as the first ruling High Priest of Amun in 1080 BCin the 
19 th Year of Ramesses XIthe Amun priesthood exercised an effective stranglehold on Egypts economy. The Amun priests owned twothirds of all the temple lands in Egypt and 90 percent of her ships plus many other resources.6 Consequently the Amun priests were as powerful as the pharaoh if not more so. The High Priests of Amun were of such power and influence that they were effectively the rulers of Upper Egypt from 1080 to c. 943 BC after which their influence declined. They are however not regarded as a ruling dynasty with pharaonic prerogatives and after this period the influence of the Amun priesthood declined. One of the sons of the High Priest Pinedjem I would eventually assume the throne and rule Egypt for almost half a century as pharaoh Psusennes I while the Theban High Priest Psusennes III would take the throne as king Psusennes II the final ruler of the Twentyfirst Dynasty of Egypt.
