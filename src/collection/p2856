18 th Dynasty Thutmose IV sometimes read as Thutmosis or Tuthmosis IV Thothmes in older history works in Latinized Greek Ancient Egyptian wti.msi.w Thoth is born3 was the 
8 th Pharaoh of the 
18 th Dynasty of Egypt who ruled in approximately the 
14 th century BC. His prenomen or royal name Menkheperure means Established in forms is Re.4 He was the son of Amenhotep II and Tiaa. Lifeedit See also Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt family tree Closeup of a scene from the Dream Stele depicting Thutmose IV giving offerings to the Great Sphinx of Giza. From a fullsized reproduction on display at the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum San Jose. Thutmose IV was born to Amenhotep II and Tiaa but was not actually the crown prince and Amenhotep IIs chosen successor to the throne. Some scholars speculate that Thutmose ousted his older brother in order to usurp power and then commissioned the Dream Stele in order to justify his unexpected kingship. Thutmoses most celebrated accomplishment was the restoration of the Great Sphinx of Giza and subsequent commission of the Dream Stele. According to Thutmoses account on the Dream Stele while the young prince was out on a hunting trip he stopped to rest under the head of the Sphinx which was buried up to the neck in sand. He soon fell asleep and had a dream in which the Sphinx told him that if he cleared away the sand and restored it he would become the next pharaoh. After completing the restoration of the Sphinx he placed a carved stone tablet now known as the Dream Stele between the two paws of the Sphinx. The restoration of the Sphinx and the text of the Dream Stele would then be a piece of propaganda on Thutmoses part meant to bestow legitimacy upon his unexpected kingship.5 Syrian Retjenu tribute bearers in the tomb of Sobekhotep during the reign of Thutmose IV Thebes. British Museum Little is known about his brief tenyear rule. He suppressed a minor uprising in Nubia in his 
8 th year attested in his Konosso stela around 1393 BC and was referred to in a stela as the Conqueror of Syria6 but little else has been pieced together about his military exploits. Betsy Bryan who penned a biography of Thutmose IV says that Thutmose IVs Konosso stela appears to refer to a minor desert patrol action on the part of the kings forces to protect certain goldmine routes in Egypts Eastern Desert from occasional attacks by the Nubians.7 Thutmose IVs rule is significant because he established peaceful relations with Mitanni and married a Mitannian princess to seal this new alliance. Thutmose IVs role in initiating contact with Egypts former rival Mitanni is documented by Amarna letter EA 29 composed decades later by Tushratta a Mittanian king who ruled during the reign of Akhenaten Thutmose IVs grandson. Tushratta states to Akhenaten that When Menkheperure the father of Nimmureya i.e. Amenhotep III wrote to Artatama my grandfather he asked for the daughter of my grandfather the sister of my father. He wrote 5 6 times but he did not give her. When he wrote my grandfather 7 times then only under such pressure did he give her.

18 th Dynasty. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology London Dating the beginning of the reign of Thutmose IV is difficult to do with certainty because he is several generations removed from the astronomical dates which are usually used to calculate Egyptian chronologies and the debate over the proper interpretation of these observances has not been settled. Thutmoses grandfather Thutmose III almost certainly acceded the throne in either 1504 or 1479 based upon two lunar observances during his reign9 and ruled for nearly 54 years.10 His successor Amenhotep II Thutmose IVs father took the throne and ruled for at least 26 years11 but has been assigned up to 35 years in some chronological reconstructions.12 The currently preferred reconstruction after analyzing all this evidence usually comes to an accession date around 1401 BC13 or 1400 BC14 for the beginning of Thutmose IVs reign. The length of his reign is not clear. He is usually given about nine or ten years of reign. Manetho credits him a reign of 9 years and 8 months.15 However Manethos other figures for the 
18 th Dynasty are frequently assigned to the wrong kings or simply incorrect so monumental evidence is also used to determine his reign length.16 Of all of Thutmose IVs dated monuments three date to his first regnal year one to his fourth possibly one to his fifth one to his sixth two to his seventh and one to his eighth.17 Two other dated objects one dated to a Year 19 and another year 20 have been suggested as possibly belonging to him but neither have been accepted as dating to his reign.17 The readings of the kings name in these dates are today accepted as referring to the prenomen of Thutmose IIIMenkheperreand not Menkheperure Thutmose IV himself. Due to the absence of higher dates for Thutmose IV after his Year 8 Konosso stela18 Manethos figures here are usually accepted.15 There were once chronological reconstructions which gave him a reign as long as 3435 years.1519 Today however most scholars ascribe him a 
10 year reign from 1401 to 1392 BC within a small margin of error. Monumentsedit Thutmose IVs Karnak chapel Thutmose IVs peristyle hall at Karnak Like most of the Thutmoside kings he built on a grand scale. Thutmose IV completed the eastern obelisk at the Temple of Karnak started by Thutmose III which at 32 m 105 ft was the tallest obelisk ever erected in Egypt.6 Thutmose IV called it the tekhen waty or unique obelisk. It was transported to the grounds of the Circus Maximus in Rome by Emperor Constantius II in 357 AD and later reerected by Pope Sixtus V in 1588 at the Piazza San Giovanni where it is today known as the Lateran Obelisk.20 Thutmose IV also built a unique chapel and peristyle hall against the back or eastern walls of the main Karnak temple building.21 The chapel was intended for people who had no right of access to the main Karnak temple. It was a place of the ear for the god Amun where the god could hear the prayers of the townspeople.22 This small alabaster chapel and peristyle hall of Thutmose IV23 has today been carefully restored by French scholars from the Centre FrancoEgyptien Dtude des Temple de Karnak CFEETK mission in Karnak.24 Burial and mummyedit Thutmose IVs mummy. Thutmose IV was buried in tomb KV43 the Valley of the Kings but his body was later moved to the mummy cache in KV35 where it was discovered by Victor Loret in 1898. An examination of his mummy conducted by Grafton Elliot Smith revealed that he was extremely emaciated at the time of his death. His height was given as 
1.6 46 m 5 ft 
4.8  in but considering that the feet have been broken off postmortem his height in life would have been taller. The forearms are crossed over the chest right over left. His hair which is parted in the middle is about 16 cm 
6.3  in long and dark reddishbrown. His ears are also pierced. Elliot Smith estimated his age to be 2528 years or possibly older.25 He was succeeded to the throne by his son Amenhotep III. In 1980 James Harris and Edward F. Wente conducted Xray examinations of New Kingdom Pharaohs crania and skeletal remains which included the mummified remains of Thutmose IV. The authors noted royal mummies like Thutmose IV showed features characteristic of North Mediterranean populations or the Western World.26 In 2012 a surgeon at Imperial College London analysed the early death of Thutmose IV and the premature deaths of other Eighteenth Dynasty pharaohs including Tutankhamun and Akhenaten. He concludes that their early deaths were likely as a result of a familial temporal epilepsy. This would account for both the untimely death of Thutmose IV and also his religious vision described on the Dream Stele due to this type of epilepsys association with intense spiritual visions and religiosity.27 His mummy has the inventory number CG 610
73.2 8 In April 2021 his mummy was moved from the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs Golden Parade.29 Galleryedit Head of a colossal statue of Thutmose IV currently housed in the British Museum.
