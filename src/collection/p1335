35.8 33 Lebanon lbnn nn  LEBnon nn Arabic  romanized Lubnn local pronunciation lbnen officially the Republic of Lebanonc is a country in the Levant region of West Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east by Israel to the south and by the Mediterranean Sea to the west Cyprus lies a short distance away from the countrys coastline. Lebanons location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterlands has contributed to the countrys rich history and shaped a unique cultural identity shaped by religious diversity.13 Lebanon has a population of more than five million people and covers an area of 10452 square kilometres 4036 sq mi. Lebanons capital and largest city is Beirut followed by Tripoli and Jounieh. While Arabic is the official language French is also recognized in a formal capacity Lebanese Arabic is the countrys vernacular though French and English play a relatively significant role in everyday life14 with Modern Standard Arabic being limited to news and government matters. The earliest evidence of human civilization in Lebanon dates back to 5000 BCE.15 From 3200 to 539 BC what was to become Lebanon was part of Phoenicia a maritime empire that stretched the Mediterranean Basin.16 In 64 BC the Roman Empire conquered the region and Lebanon soon became a major center for Christianity under the aegis of the Byzantine Empire. In the 
7 th century the Muslim conquest of the Levant brought the region under the control of the Rashidun Caliphate. The 
11 th century saw the beginning of the Crusades and the establishment of Crusader states which later fell to the Ayyubids and the Mamluks who in turn ceded the territory to the Ottoman Turks in the aftermath of the OttomanMamluk War of 15161517. Under Ottoman ruler Abdulmejid I the first Lebanese protostate was established in the form of the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate created in the 
19 th century as a home for Maronite Christians under the Ottoman Tanzimat period. After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire around World War I the five Ottoman provinces constituting modernday Lebanon came under the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon to be administered by France. Under the Mandate administration France established Greater Lebanon as the predecessor state to todays independent Lebanon. However French rule over the region weakened significantly in the aftermath of the German invasion of France in 1940 during World War II. By 1943 Lebanon had gained independence from Free France and subsequently established a distinct form of confessionalist government with the states major religious groups being apportioned specific political powers. The new Lebanese state was relatively stable for a short period after independence17 but this was ultimately shattered by the outbreak of largescale fighting in the Lebanese Civil War 19751990 between various political and sectarian factions. Amidst the internal hostilities of this period Lebanon was also subjugated by two overlapping military occupations by Syria from 1976 to 2005 and by Israel from 1985 to 2000. Since the end of the conflicts there have been extensive efforts to revive the economy and rebuild national infrastructure.18 Lebanon is a developing country ranked 1
12 th on the Human Development Index.19 It has been classified as an uppermiddleincome state.20 The Lebanese liquidity crisis coupled with nationwide corruption and recent disasters such as the 2020 Beirut explosion have precipitated the collapse of Lebanons currency and fomented political instability widespread resource shortages and high unemployment and poverty. The World Bank has defined Lebanons economic crisis as one of the worlds worst since the 
19 th century.2122 Despite the countrys small size23 Lebanese culture is renowned both in the Arab world and globally powered primarily by the Lebanese diaspora.24 Lebanon is a founding member of the United Nations and of the Arab League25 and is a member of the NonAligned Movement the Organization of Islamic Cooperation the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie and the Group of 77 among others. Etymology The name of Mount Lebanon originates from the Phoenician root lbn  meaning white apparently from its snowcapped peaks.2627 Occurrences of the name have been found in different Middle Bronze Age texts from the library of Ebla28 and three of the twelve tablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh. The name is recorded in Ancient Egyptian as Rmnn  where R stood for Canaanite L.29 The name occurs nearly 70 times in the Hebrew Bible as  Lnn.30 Lebanon as the name of an administrative unit as opposed to the mountain range that was introduced with the Ottoman reforms of 1861 as the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate Arabic    Turkish Cebeli Lbnan Mutasarrfl continued in the name of the State of Greater Lebanon Arabic    Dawlat Lubnn alKabr French tat du Grand Liban in 1920 and eventually in the name of the sovereign Republic of Lebanon Arabic   alJumhryah alLubnnyah upon its independence in 1943.citation needed History Main article History of Lebanon This section needs additional citations for verification.

Its territory was in the core of the Bronze Age Canaanite Phoenician citystates. As part of the Levant it was part of numerous succeeding empires throughout ancient history including the Egyptian Assyrian Babylonian Achaemenid Hellenistic Sasanian and Roman empires. After the 
7 thcentury Muslim conquest of the Levant it was part of the Rashidun Umayyad Abbasid Fatimid and Seljuk empires. The crusader state of the County of Tripoli founded by Raymond IV of Toulouse in 1102 encompassed most of presentday Lebanon falling to the Mamluk Sultanate in 1289 and finally to the Ottoman Empire in 15
16.3 1 With the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire Greater Lebanon fell under French mandate in 192032 and gained independence under president Bechara El Khoury in 1943. Lebanons history since independence has been marked by alternating periods of relative political stability and prosperity based on Beiruts position as a regional center for finance and trade interspersed with political turmoil and armed conflict 1948 ArabIsraeli War Lebanese Civil War 19751990 2005 Cedar Revolution 2006 Lebanon War 2007 Lebanon conflict 200608 Lebanese protests 2008 conflict in Lebanon 2011 Syrian Civil War spillover and 201920 Lebanese protests.33 Antiquity Main article History of ancient Lebanon Byblos is believed to have been first occupied between 8800 and 7000 BC34 and continuously inhabited since 5000 BC35 making it among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.3637 It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.38 Evidence dating back to an early settlement in Lebanon was found in Byblos considered among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.15 The evidence dates back to earlier than 5000 BC. Archaeologists discovered remnants of prehistoric huts with crushed limestone floors primitive weapons and burial jars left by the Neolithic and Chalcolithic fishing communities who lived on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea over 7000 years ago.39 Lebanon was part of northern Canaan and consequently became the homeland of Canaanite descendants the Phoenicians a seafaring people based in the coastal strip of the northern Levant who spread across the Mediterranean in the first millennium BC.40 The most prominent Phoenician cities were Byblos Sidon and Tyre. According to the Bible King Hiram of Tyre collaborated closely with Solomon supplying cedar logs for Solomons Temple and sending skilled workers.41 The Phoenicians are credited with the invention of the oldest verified alphabet which subsequently inspired the Greek alphabet and the Latin one thereafter.42 In the 
9 th century BC Phoenician colonies including Carthage in presentday Tunisia and Cdiz in presentday Spain flourished throughout the Mediterranean. Subsequently foreign powers starting with the Assyrians imposed tribute and attacked noncompliant cities. Babylonians took control in the 
6 th century BC.41 In 539 BC The cities of Phoenicia were incorporated into the Persian Achaemenid Empire by Cyrus the Great.43 The Phoenician citystates were later incorporated into the empire of Alexander the Great following the siege of Tyre in 332 BC.43 Map of Phoenicia and trade routes In 64 BC the Roman general Pompey the Great had the region of Syria annexed into the Roman Republic. The region was then split into two Imperial Provinces under the Roman Empire Coele Syria and Phoenice the latter which the land of presentday Lebanon was a part of. The region that is now Lebanon as with the rest of Syria and much of Anatolia became a major center of Christianity in the Roman Empire during the early spread of the faith. During the late 
4 th and early 
5 th century a hermit named Maron established a monastic tradition focused on the importance of monotheism and asceticism near the Mediterranean mountain range known as Mount Lebanon. The monks who followed Maron spread his teachings among Lebanese in the region. These Christians came to be known as Maronites and moved into the mountains to avoid religious persecution by Roman authorities.44 During the frequent RomanPersian Wars that lasted for many centuries the Sassanid Persians occupied what is now Lebanon from 619 till 6
29.4 5 Middle Ages During the 
7 th century Muslim Arabs conquered Syria from the Byzantines incorporating the region including modernday Lebanon under the Islamic Caliphate.46 In the era of Uthmans caliphate 644656 Islam gained significant influence in Damascus led by Muawiya a relative of Uthman serving as the governor. Muawiya sent forces to the coastal region of Lebanon prompting conversions to Islam among the coastal population. However the mountainous areas retained their Christian or other cultural practices.41 Despite Islam and Arabic becoming officially dominant the populations conversion from Christianity and Syriac language was gradual. The Maronite community in particular managed to maintain a large degree of autonomy despite the succession of rulers over Lebanon and Syria. The relative but not complete isolation of the Lebanese mountains meant the mountains served as a refuge in the times of religious and political crises in the Levant. As such the mountains displayed religious diversity and the existence of several wellestablished sects and religions notably Maronites Druze Shiite Muslims Ismailis Alawites and Jacobites.citation needed After the Islamic conquest Mediterranean trade declined for three centuries due to conflicts with the Byzantines. The ports of Tyre Sidon Beirut and Tripoli struggled to recover sustaining small populations under Umayyad and Abbasid rule. Christians and Jews were often obligated to pay the jizya or poll tax levied on nonMuslims.46 During the 9
80 s the Fatimid Caliphate took control of the Levant including Mount Lebanon resulting in the rejuvenation of Mediterranean trade along the Lebanese coast through renewed connections with Byzantium and Italy. This resurgence saw Tripoli and Tyre flourishing well into the 
11 th century focusing on exports such as textiles sugar and glassware.46 During the 
11 th century the Druze religion emerged from a branch of Shia Islam. The new religion gained followers in the southern portion of Mount Lebanon. The southern portion of Mount Lebanon was ruled by Druze feudal families till the early 
14 th century. The Maronite population increased gradually in Northern Mount Lebanon and the Druze have remained in Southern Mount Lebanon until the modern era. Keserwan Jabal Amel and the Beqaa Valley was ruled by Shia feudal families under the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire. Major cities on the coast Sidon Tyre Acre Tripoli Beirut and others were directly administered by the Muslim Caliphs and the people became more fully absorbed by the Arab culture. The Fall of Tripoli to the Egyptian Mamluks and destruction of the Crusader state the County of Tripoli 1289 Following the fall of Roman Anatolia to the Muslim Turks the Byzantines put out a call to the Pope in Rome for assistance in the 
11 th century. The result was a series of wars known as the Crusades launched by the Franks from Western Europe to reclaim the former Byzantine Christian territories in the Eastern Mediterranean especially Syria and Palestine the Levant. The First Crusade succeeded in temporarily establishing the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Tripoli as Roman Catholic Christian states along the coast.47 These crusader states made a lasting impact on the region though their control was limited and the region returned to full Muslim control after two centuries following the conquest by the Mamluks. Among the most lasting effects of the Crusades in this region was the contact between the Franks i.e. the French and the Maronites. Unlike most other Christian communities in the Eastern Mediterranean who swore allegiance to Constantinople or other local patriarchs the Maronites proclaimed allegiance to the Pope in Rome. As such the Franks saw them as Roman Catholic brethren. These initial contacts led to centuries of support for the Maronites from France and Italy even after the fall of the Crusader states in the region.

17 th century In 1516 Lebanon became part of the Ottoman Empire with governance administered indirectly through local emirs.48 Lebanons area was organized into provinces Northern and Southern Mount Lebanon Tripoli Baalbek and Beqaa Valley and Jabal Amil. In 1590 Druze tribal leader Fakhr alDin II succeeded Korkmaz in southern Mount Lebanon and quickly asserted his authority as the paramount emir of the Druze in the Shouf region. Eventually he was appointed Sanjakbey overseeing various Ottoman subprovinces and tax collection. Expanding his influence extensively he even constructed a fort in Palmyra.49 However this expansion raised concerns for Ottoman Sultan Murad IV leading to a punitive expedition in 1633. Fakhr alDin II was captured imprisoned for two years and subsequently executed in April 1635 along with one of his sons.50 Surviving members of his family continued to govern a reduced area under closer Ottoman supervision until the late 
17 th century. On the death of the last Maan emir various members of the Shihab clan ruled Mount Lebanon until 1830. While the history of DruzeChristian relations in Lebanon has generally been marked by harmony and peaceful coexistence51525354 though there were occasional periods of tension notably during the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war during which around 10000 Christians were killed by the Druze.55 Shortly afterwards the Emirate of Mount Lebanon which lasted about 400 years was replaced by the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate as a result of a EuropeanOttoman treaty called the Rglement Organique. The Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate565758 18611918 Arabic    Turkish Cebeli Lbnan Mutasarrfl was one of the Ottoman Empires subdivisions following the Tanzimat reform. After 1861 there existed an autonomous Mount Lebanon with a Christian mutasarrf which had been created as a homeland for the Maronites under European diplomatic pressure following the 1860 massacres. The Maronite Catholics and the Druze founded modern Lebanon in the early eighteenth century through the ruling and social system known as the MaroniteDruze dualism in Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate.59 1862 map drawn by the French expedition of Beaufort dHautpoul60 later used as a template for the 1920 borders of Greater Lebanon.6162 The Baalbek and Beqaa Valley and Jabal Amel was ruled intermittently by various Shia feudal families especially the Al Ali Alsagheer in Jabal Amel that remained in power until 1865 when Ottomans took direct ruling of the region. Youssef Bey Karam63 a Lebanese nationalist played an influential role in Lebanons independence during this era. Lebanon experienced profound devastation in the First World War when the Ottoman army assumed direct control disrupting supplies and confiscating animals ultimately leading to a severe famine.48 During the war approximately 100000 people in Beirut and Mount Lebanon died due to starvation.64 French Mandate Amidst the height of the First World War the SykesPicot Agreement of 1916 a secret pact between Britain and France delineated Lebanon and its surrounding areas as regions open to potential French influence or control.48 After the Allies emerged victorious in the war the Ottoman Empire ultimately collapsed losing control over the area. Soon after the war Patriarch Elias Peter Hoayek representing the Maronite Christians successfully campaigned for an expanded territory at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference also including areas with significant Muslim and Druze populations in addition to the Christiandominated Mount Lebanon.48 In 1920 King Faisal I proclaimed the Arab Kingdom of Syrias independence and asserted control over Lebanon. However following a defeat to the French at the Battle of Maysalun the kingdom was dissolved.48 Around the same time at the San Remo Conference tasked with deciding the fate of former Ottoman territories it was determined that Syria and Lebanon would fall under French rule Shortly afterward the formal division of territories took place in the Treaty of Svres signed a few months later.48 On September 1 1920 Greater Lebanon or Grand Liban was officially established under French control as a League of Nations Mandate following the terms outlined in the proposed Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. Greater Lebanon united the regions of Mount Lebanon North Lebanon South Lebanon and the Bekaa with Beirut as its designated capital.6548 These specified boundaries later evolved into the presentday configuration of Lebanon. This arrangement was later ratified in July 19
22.4 8 The Lebanese Republic was officially proclaimed on September 1 1926 with the adoption of a constitution inspired by the French constitution on May 23 of the same year. While a Lebanese government was established the country continued to be under French control.48 Pressure on Germanoccupied France Map of the French Mandate and the states created in 1920 Lebanon gained a measure of independence while France was occupied by Germany.66 General Henri Dentz the Vichy High commissioner for Syria and Lebanon played a major role in the independence of the nation. The Vichy authorities in 1941 allowed Germany to move aircraft and supplies through Syria to Iraq where they were used against British forces. The United Kingdom fearing that Nazi Germany would gain full control of Lebanon and Syria by pressure on the weak Vichy government sent its army into Syria and Lebanon.67 After the fighting ended in Lebanon General Charles de Gaulle visited the area. Under political pressure from both inside and outside Lebanon de Gaulle recognized the independence of Lebanon. On 26 November 1941 General Georges Catroux announced that Lebanon would become independent under the authority of the Free French government. Elections were held in 1943 and on 8 November 1943 the new Lebanese government unilaterally abolished the mandate. The French reacted by imprisoning the new government. In the face of international pressure the French released the government officials on 22 November 1943. The Allies occupied the region until the end of World War II. Martyrs Square in Beirut during celebrations marking the release by the French of Lebanons government from Rashayya prison on 22 November 1943 Independence from Free France Following the end of World War II in Europe the French mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the League of Nations or its successor the United Nations. The mandate was ended by the declaration of the mandatory power and of the new states themselves of their independence followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers culminating in formal admission to the United Nations. Article 78 of the UN Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality.68 So when the UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945 after ratification of the United Nations Charter by the five permanent members as both Syria and Lebanon were founding member states the French mandate for both was legally terminated on that date and full independence attained.69 The last French troops withdrew in December 1946. Lebanons unwritten National Pact of 1943 required that its president be Maronite Christian its speaker of the parliament to be a Shia Muslim its prime minister be Sunni Muslim and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament and the Deputy Prime Minister be Greek Orthodox.70 Lebanons history since independence has been marked by alternating periods of political stability and turmoil interspersed with prosperity built on Beiruts position as a regional center for finance and trade.71 In May 1948 Lebanon supported neighboring Arab countries in a war against Israel. While some irregular forces crossed the border and carried out minor skirmishes against Israel it was without the support of the Lebanese government and Lebanese troops did not officially invade.72 Lebanon agreed to support the forces with covering artillery fire armored cars volunteers and logistical support.73 On 56 June 1948 the Lebanese army  led by the then Minister of National Defense Emir Majid Arslan  captured AlMalkiyya. This was Lebanons only success in the war.74 Under Camille Chamouns presidency Lebanon experienced economic boom 100000 Palestinians fled to Lebanon because of the war. Israel did not permit their return after the ceasefire.75 As of 2017 between 174000 and 450000 Palestinian refugees live in Lebanon with about half in refugee camps although these are often decades old and resemble neighborhoods.76 Palestinians often cannot obtain Lebanese citizenship or even Lebanese identity cards and are legally barred from owning property or performing certain occupations including law medicine and engineering.77 According to Human Rights Watch Palestinian refugees in Lebanon live in appalling social and economic conditions. In 1958 during the last months of President Camille Chamouns term an insurrection broke out instigated by Lebanese Muslims who wanted to make Lebanon a member of the United Arab Republic. Chamoun requested assistance and 5000 United States Marines were briefly dispatched to Beirut on 15 July. After the crisis a new government was formed led by the popular former general Fouad Chehab. Until the early 19
70 s Lebanon was dubbed the Switzerland of the Middle East for its unique status as both a snowcapped holiday destination and secure banking hub for Gulf Arabs.78 With the 1970 defeat of the PLO in Jordan many Palestinian militants relocated to Lebanon increasing their armed campaign against Israel. The relocation of Palestinian bases also led to increasing sectarian tensions between Palestinians versus the Maronites and other Lebanese factions. Lebanese Civil War Main articles Lebanese Civil War Syrian occupation of Lebanon and Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon The Green Line that separated west and east Beirut 1982 In 1975 following increasing sectarian tensions largely boosted by Palestinian militant relocation into South Lebanon a fullscale civil war broke out in Lebanon. The Lebanese Civil War pitted a coalition of Christian groups against the joint forces of the PLO leftwing Druze and Muslim militias. In June 1976 Lebanese President lias Sarkis asked for the Syrian Army to intervene on the side of the Christians and help restore peace.79 In October 1976 the Arab League agreed to establish a predominantly Syrian Arab Deterrent Force which was charged with restoring calm.80 PLO attacks from Lebanon into Israel in 1977 and 1978 escalated tensions between the countries. On 11 March 1978 11 Fatah fighters landed on a beach in northern Israel and hijacked two buses full of passengers on the Haifa  TelAviv road shooting at passing vehicles in what became known as the Coastal Road massacre. They killed 37 and wounded 76 Israelis before being killed in a firefight with Israeli forces.81 Israel invaded Lebanon four days later in Operation Litani. The Israeli Army occupied most of the area south of the Litani River. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 425 calling for immediate Israeli withdrawal and creating the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon UNIFIL charged with attempting to establish peace. Map showing the Blue Line demarcation line between Lebanon and Israel established by the UN after the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 1978 Bachir Gemayel 19471982 became president of Lebanon in 1982 Israeli forces withdrew later in 1978 but retained control of the southern region by managing a 
19 kilometrewide 12 mi security zone along the border. These positions were held by the South Lebanon Army SLA a Christian militia under the leadership of Major Saad Haddad backed by Israel. The Israeli Prime Minister Likuds Menachem Begin compared the plight of the Christian minority in southern Lebanon then about 5 of the population in SLA territory to that of European Jews during World War II.82 The PLO routinely attacked Israel during the period of the ceasefire with over 270 documented attacks.83 People in Galilee regularly had to leave their homes during these shellings. Documents captured in PLO headquarters after the invasion showed they had come from Lebanon.84 Arafat refused to condemn these attacks on the grounds that the ceasefire was only relevant to Lebanon.85 In April 1980 the presence of UNIFIL soldiers in the buffer zone led to the At Tiri incident. On 17 July 1981 Israeli aircraft bombed multistory apartment buildings in Beirut that contained offices of PLO associated groups. The Lebanese delegate to the United Nations Security Council claimed that 300 civilians had been killed and 800 wounded. The bombing led to worldwide condemnation and a temporary embargo on the export of U.S. aircraft to Israel.86 In August 1981 defense minister Ariel Sharon began to draw up plans to attack PLO military infrastructure in West Beirut where PLO headquarters and command bunkers were located.87 Map showing power balance in Lebanon 1983 controlled by Syria controlled by Christian groups controlled by Israel controlled by the UN In 1982 the PLO attacks from Lebanon on Israel led to an Israeli invasion aiming to support Lebanese forces in driving out the PLO. A multinational force of American French and Italian contingents joined in 1983 by a British contingent were deployed in Beirut after the Israeli siege of the city to supervise the evacuation of the PLO. The civil war reemerged in September 1982 after the assassination of Lebanese President Bachir Gemayel an Israeli ally and subsequent fighting. During this time a number of sectarian massacres occurred such as in Sabra and Shatila and in several refugee camps.88 The multinational force was withdrawn in the spring of 1984 following a devastating bombing attack during the previous year. During the early 19
80 s Hezbollah a Shiite Islamist militant group and political party came into existence through the efforts of Shiite clerics who were financially supported and trained by Iran. Arising in the aftermath of the 1982 war and drawing inspiration from the Islamic Revolution in Iran Hezbollah actively engaged in combat against Israel as well as suicide attacks car bombings and assassinations. Their objectives encompassed eliminating Israel fighting for the Shia cause in the Lebanese civil war ending Western presence in Lebanon and establishing a Shiite Khomeinist Islamic state.894690 In the late 19
80 s as Amine Gemayels second term as president drew to an end the Lebanese pound collapsed. At the end of 1987 US1 was worth L500. This meant the legal minimum wage was worth just 17 a month. Most goods in shops were priced in dollars and a Save the Children director estimated that 2300000 children were need of assistance and were living almost entirely on bread which was subsidized by the government. Those that could depended on foreign assistance. Hizbullah was receiving about 35 million a month from Iran.91 In September 1988 the Parliament failed to elect a successor to President Gemayel as a result of differences between the Christians Muslims and Syrians. The Arab League Summit of May 1989 led to the formation of a SaudiMoroccanAlgerian committee to solve the crisis. On 16 September 1989 the committee issued a peace plan which was accepted by all. A ceasefire was established the ports and airports were reopened and refugees began to return.80 Rafic Hariri prime minister of Lebanon in 1996 In the same month the Lebanese Parliament agreed to the Taif Agreement which included an outline timetable for Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon and a formula for the deconfessionalization of the Lebanese political system.80 The civil war ended at the end of 1990 after 16 years it had caused massive loss of human life and property and devastated the countrys economy. It is estimated that 150000 people were killed and another 200000 wounded.92 Nearly a million civilians were displaced by the war and some never returned.93 Parts of Lebanon were left in ruins.94 The Taif Agreement has still not been implemented in full and Lebanons political system continues to be divided along sectarian lines. Conflict between Israel and Lebanese militants continued leading to a series of violent events and clashes including the Qana massacre.95969798 In May 2000 Israeli forces fully withdrew from Lebanon.9996100 Since then 25 May is regarded by the Lebanese as the Liberation Day.10110296 The internal political situation in Lebanon significantly changed in the early 20
00 s. After the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and the death of former president Hafez alAssad in 2000 the Syrian military presence faced criticism and resistance from the Lebanese population.103 Postwar Cedar Revolution and 2006 War See also Assassination of Rafic Hariri Cedar Revolution and 2006 Lebanon War On 14 February 2005 former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was assassinated in a car bomb explosion.104 Leaders of the March 14 Alliance accused Syria of the attack105 while Syria and the March 8 Alliance claimed that Israel was behind the assassination. The Hariri assassination marked the beginning of a series of assassinations that resulted in the death of many prominent Lebanese figures.nb 1 The assassination triggered the Cedar Revolution a series of demonstrations which demanded the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the establishment of an international commission to investigate the assassination. Under pressure from the West Syria began withdrawing106 and by 26 April 2005 all Syrian soldiers had returned to Syria.107 UNSC Resolution 1595 called for an investigation into the assassination.108 The United Nations International Independent Investigation Commission published preliminary findings on 20 October 2005 in the Mehlis report which cited indications that the assassination was organized by Syrian and Lebanese intelligence services.109110111112 On 12 July 2006 Hezbollah launched a series of rocket attacks and raids into Israeli territory where they killed three Israeli soldiers and captured two others.113 Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery fire on targets in Lebanon and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon resulting in the 2006 Lebanon War. The conflict was officially ended by the UNSC Resolution 1701 on 14 August 2006 which ordered a ceasefire the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon and the disarmament of Hezbollah.114115 Some 1191 Lebanese116 and 160 Israelis117 were killed in the conflict.

At least 169 soldiers 287 insurgents and 47 civilians were killed in the battle. Funds for the reconstruction of the area have been slow to materialize.119 Between 2006 and 2008 a series of protests led by groups opposed to the proWestern Prime Minister Fouad Siniora demanded the creation of a national unity government over which the mostly Shia opposition groups would have veto power. When mile Lahouds presidential term ended in October 2007 the opposition refused to vote for a successor unless a powersharing deal was reached leaving Lebanon without a president. On 9 May 2008 Hezbollah and Amal forces sparked by a government declaration that Hezbollahs communications network was illegal seized western Beirut120121 the most important Sunni center in Lebanon leading to an intrastate military conflict.122 The Lebanese government denounced the violence as a coup attempt.123 At least 62 people died in the resulting clashes between progovernment and opposition militias.124 On 21 May 2008 the signing of the Doha Agreement ended the fighting.120124 As part of the accord which ended 18 months of political paralysis125 Michel Suleiman became president and a national unity government was established granting a veto to the opposition.120 The agreement was a victory for opposition forces as the government caved in to all their main demands.124 Over 20000 Syrian and Palestinian refugees live in the Shatila refugee camp on the outskirts of Beirut. In early January 2011 the national unity government collapsed due to growing tensions stemming from the Special Tribunal for Lebanon which was expected to indict Hezbollah members for the Hariri assassination.126 The parliament elected Najib Mikati the candidate for the Hezbollahled March 8 Alliance Prime Minister of Lebanon making him responsible for forming a new government.127 Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah insists that Israel was responsible for the assassination of Hariri.128 A report leaked by the AlAkhbar newspaper in November 2010 stated that Hezbollah has drafted plans for a takeover of the country in case the Special Tribunal for Lebanon issues an indictment against its members.129 In 2012 the Syrian civil war threatened to spill over in Lebanon causing more incidents of sectarian violence and armed clashes between Sunnis and Alawites in Tripoli.130 According to UNHCR the number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon increased from around 250000 in early 2013 to 1000000 in late 20
14.1 31 In 2013 The Lebanese Forces Party the Kataeb Party and the Free Patriotic Movement voiced concerns that the countrys sectarian based political system is being undermined by the influx of Syrian refugees.132 On 6 May 2015 UNHCR suspended registration of Syrian refugees at the request of the Lebanese government.133 In February 2016 the Lebanese government signed the Lebanon Compact granting a minimum of 400 million of support for refugees and vulnerable Lebanese citizens.134 As of October 2016 the government estimates that the country hosts 
1.5  million Syrians.135 National crisis 20

On 19 December 2019 former Minister of Education Hassan Diab was designated the next prime minister and tasked with forming a new cabinet.147 Protests and acts of civil disobedience have since continued with protesters denouncing and condemning the designation of Diab as prime minister.148149150 Lebanon is suffering the worst economic crisis in decades.151152 Lebanon is the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to see its inflation rate exceed 50 for 30 consecutive days according to Steve H. Hanke professor of applied economics at the Johns Hopkins University.153 On 4 August 2020 an explosion at the port of Beirut Lebanons main port destroyed the surrounding areas killing over 200 people and injuring thousands more. The cause of the explosion was later determined to be 2750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been unsafely stored and accidentally set on fire that Tuesday afternoon.154 Protests resumed within days following the explosion which resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister Hassan Diab and his cabinet on 10 August 2020 nonetheless continuing to stay in office in a caretaker capacity.155 Demonstrations continued into 2021 with Lebanese blocking the roads with burned tires protesting against the poverty and the economic crisis. On 11 March 2021 the caretaker minister of energy Raymond Ghajar warned that Lebanon was threatened with total darkness at the end of March if no money was secured to buy fuel for power stations.156 In August 2021 a large fuel explosion in northern Lebanon killed 28 people.157 September saw the formation of a new cabinet led by former prime minister Najib Mikati.158 On 9 October 2021 the entire nation lost power for 24 hours after its two main power stations ran out of power due to the currency and fuel shortage.159 Days later sectarian violence in Beirut killed a number of people in the deadliest clashes in the country since 20
08.1 60 By January 2022 BBC News reported that the crisis in Lebanon had deepened further with the value of the Lebanese pound plummeting and a scheduled general election expected to be delayed indefinitely.161 The postponement of parliamentary elections was said to prolong the political deadlock in the country. The European Parliament called Lebanons present situation a manmade disaster caused by a handful of men across the political class.162 In May 2022 Lebanon held its first election since a painful economic crisis dragged it to the brink of becoming a failed state. Lebanons crisis has been so severe that more than 80 percent of the population is now considered poor by the United Nations. In the election the Shia Muslim Hezbollah movement and its allies lost their parliamentary majority. Hezbollah did not lose any of its seats but its allies lost seats. Hezbollahs ally President Michel Aouns Free Patriotic Movement was no longer the biggest Christian party after the election. A rival Christian party the Lebanese Forces led by Samir Geagea became the largest Christianbased party in parliament. The Sunni Future Movement led by former prime minister Saad Hariri did not participate the election leaving a political vacuum to other Sunni politicians to fill.163164165 The Lebanese crisis became so severe that multiple boats left the coast holding migrants in a desperate run from the country. Many proved unsuccessful and fatal. In April 2022 6 people died and around 50 people are rescued after an overloaded boat sinks in Tripoli.166 And on September 22 at least 94 people were killed when a boat carrying migrants from Lebanon capsizes off Syrias coast. 9 people survived. Many were declared missing and some were found either dead or injured. Dead bodies were sent to nearby hospitals. 40 people are still missing as of 24 September.167 On 1 February 2023 the central bank of Lebanon devalued the Lebanese pound by 90 amid the ongoing financial crisis.168 This was the first time Lebanon had devalued its official exchange rate in 25 years.169 As of 2023 Lebanon is considered to have become a failed state suffering from chronic poverty economic mismanagement and a banking collapse.170 Geography Main article Geography of Lebanon Kadisha Valley a view from Qannoubine Monastery Lebanon is located in West Asia between latitudes 33 and 35 N and longitudes 35 and 37 E. Its land straddles the northwest of the Arabian Plate.171 The countrys surface area is 10452 square kilometres 4036 sq mi of which 10230 square kilometres 3950 sq mi is land. Lebanon has a coastline and border of 225 kilometres 140 mi on the Mediterranean Sea to the west a 375 kilometres 233 mi border shared with Syria to the north and east and a 79 kilometres 49 mi long border with Israel to the south.172 The border with the Israelioccupied Golan Heights is disputed by Lebanon in a small area called Shebaa Farms.173 Lebanon from space. Snow cover can be seen on the western Mount Lebanon and eastern AntiLebanon mountain ranges Lebanon is divided into four distinct physiographic regions the coastal plain the Lebanon mountain range the Beqaa Valley and the AntiLebanon Mountains. The narrow and discontinuous coastal plain stretches from the Syrian border in the north where it widens to form the Akkar plain to Ras alNaqoura at the border with Israel in the south. The fertile coastal plain is formed of marine sediments and river deposited alluvium alternating with sandy bays and rocky beaches. Lebanons mountains rise steeply parallel to the Mediterranean coast and form a ridge of limestone and sandstone that runs for most of the countrys length. The mountain range varies in width between 10 km 6 mi and 56 km 35 mi it is carved by narrow and deep gorges. The Lebanon mountains peak at 3088 metres 10131 ft above sea level in Qurnat as Sawda in North Lebanon and gradually slope to the south before rising again to a height of 2695 metres 8842 ft in Mount Sannine. The Beqaa valley sits between the Lebanon mountains in the west and the AntiLebanon range in the east it is a part of the Great Rift Valley system. The valley is 180 km 112 mi long and 10 to 26 km 6 to 16 mi wide its fertile soil is formed by alluvial deposits. The AntiLebanon range runs parallel to the Lebanon mountains its highest peak is in Mount Hermon at 2814 metres 9232 ft.172 The mountains of Lebanon are drained by seasonal torrents and rivers foremost of which is the 145 kilometres 90 mi long Leontes that rises in the Beqaa Valley to the west of Baalbek and empties into the Mediterranean Sea north of Tyre.172 Lebanon has 16 rivers all of which are nonnavigable 13 rivers originate from Mount Lebanon and run through the steep gorges and into the Mediterranean Sea the other three arise in the Beqaa Valley.174 Climate Main article Climate of Lebanon Lebanon has a moderate Mediterranean climate. In coastal areas winters are generally cool and rainy whilst summers are hot and humid. In more elevated areas temperatures usually drop below freezing during the winter with heavy snow cover that remains until early summer on the higher mountaintops.172175 Although most of Lebanon receives a relatively large amount of rainfall when measured annually in comparison to its arid surroundings certain areas in northeastern Lebanon receives only little because of the rain shadow created by the high peaks of the western mountain range.176 Environment Main articles Wildlife of Lebanon and Marine environmental issues in Lebanon The Lebanon cedar is the national emblem of Lebanon. Pilgrimage to the Cedars of Libanon  painting by a Hungarian painter Csontvry Kosztka Tivadar. In ancient times Lebanon was covered by large forests of cedar trees the national emblem of the country.177 Millennia of deforestation have altered the hydrology in Mount Lebanon and changed the regional climate adversely.178 As of 2012 forests covered 
13.4  of the Lebanese land area179 they are under constant threat from wildfires caused by the long dry summer season.180 As a result of longstanding exploitation few old cedar trees remain in pockets of forests in Lebanon but there is an active program to conserve and regenerate the forests. The Lebanese approach has emphasized natural regeneration over planting by creating the right conditions for germination and growth. The Lebanese state has created several nature reserves that contain cedars including the Shouf Biosphere Reserve the Jaj Cedar Reserve the Tannourine Reserve the Ammouaa and Karm Shbat Reserves in the Akkar district and the Forest of the Cedars of God near Bsharri.181182183 Lebanon had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 
3.7 610 ranking it 1
41 st globally out of 172 countries.184 In 2010 the Environment Ministry set a 
10 year plan to increase the national forest coverage by 20 which is equivalent to the planting of two million new trees each year.185 The plan which was funded by the United States Agency for International Development USAID and implemented by the U.S. Forest Service USFS through the Lebanon Reforestation Initiative LRI was inaugurated in 2011 by planting cedar pine wild almond juniper fir oak and other seedlings in ten regions around Lebanon.185 As of 2016 forests covered 
13.6  of Lebanon and other wooded lands represented a further 
11.1 86 Since 2011 over 600000 trees including cedars and other native species have been planted throughout the country as part of the Lebanon Reforestation Initiative LRI.187 Lebanon contains two terrestrial ecoregions Eastern Mediterranean conifersclerophyllousbroadleaf forests and Southern Anatolian montane conifer and deciduous forests.188 Beirut and Mount Lebanon have been facing a severe garbage crisis. After the closure of the Bourj Hammoud dump in 1997 the alNaameh dumpsite was opened by the government in 1998. The alNaameh dumpsite was planned to contain 2 million tons of waste for a limited period of six years at the most. It was designed to be a temporary solution while the government would have devised a longterm plan. Sixteen years later alNaameh was still open and exceeded its capacity by 13 million tons. In July 2015 the residents of the area already protesting in the recent years forced the closure of the dumpsite. The inefficiency of the government as well as the corruption inside of the waste management company Sukleen in charge of managing the garbage in Lebanon have resulted in piles of garbage blocking streets in Mount Lebanon and Beirut.189 Mount Lebanon is a mountain range in Lebanon. It averages above 2500 m 8200 ft in elevation. In December 2015 the Lebanese government signed an agreement with Chinook Industrial Mining part owned by Chinook Sciences to export over 100000 tons of untreated waste from Beirut and the surrounding area. The waste had accumulated in temporary locations following the government closure of the countys largest land fill site five months earlier. The contract was jointly signed with Howa International which has offices in the Netherlands and Germany. The contract is reported to cost 212 per ton. The waste which is compacted and infectious would have to be sorted and was estimated to be enough to fill 2000 containers.190 Initial reports that the waste was to be exported to Sierra Leone have been denied by diplomats.191 In February 2016 the government withdrew from negotiations after it was revealed that documents relating to the export of the trash to Russia were forgeries.192 On 19 March 2016 the Cabinet reopened the Naameh landfill for 60 days in line with a plan it passed few days earlier to end the trash crisis. The plan also stipulates the establishment of landfills in Bourj Hammoud and Costa Brava east and south of Beirut respectively. Sukleen trucks began removing piled garbage from Karantina and heading to Naameh. Environment Minister Mohammad Machnouk announced during a chat with activists that over 8000 tons of garbage had been collected up to that point in only 24 hours as part of the governments trash plan. The plans execution was ongoing at last report.193 In 2017 Human Rights Watch found that Lebanons garbage crisis and open burning of waste in particular was posing a health risk to residents and violating the states obligations under international law.194 In September 2018 Lebanons parliament passed a law that banned open dumping and burning of waste. Despite penalties set in case of violations Lebanese municipalities have been openly burning the waste putting the lives of people in danger. In October 2018 Human Rights Watch researchers witnessed the open burning of dumps in alQantara and Qabrikha.195 On Sunday 13 October 2019 at night a series of about 100 forest fires according to Lebanese Civil Defense broke out and spread over large areas of Lebanons forests. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad AlHariri confirmed his contact with a number of countries to send assistance via helicopters and firefighting planes196 Cyprus Jordan Turkey and Greece participated in firefighting. According to press reports on Tuesday 15 October fire has decreased in different places due to the rains.197 Lebanons ongoing economic crisis has precipitated electricity shortages prompting an increased reliance on diesel generators and subsequently contributing to environmental deterioration and health hazards. The scarcity of power has led to a heightened contamination of water sources. The compromised infrastructure marked by sewage infiltrating drinking water has given rise to significant health concerns including an increase in cases of Hepatitis A. The health service grappling with workforce shortages due to emigration struggles amid a growing public health crisis.198 Government and politics Main articles Politics of Lebanon and Human rights in Lebanon The Lebanese parliament building at the Place de ltoile Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy that includes confessionalism.199 The National Pact erected in 1943 laid out a governing arrangement intended to harmonize the interests of the countrys major religious groups.200 The President has to be a Maronite Christian the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim the Speaker of the Parliament a Shia Muslim the Deputy Prime Minister and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament Eastern Orthodox.201202 This system is intended to deter sectarian conflict and to represent fairly the demographic distribution of the 18 recognized religious groups in government.203204 Until 1975 Freedom House considered Lebanon to be among only two together with Israel politically free countries in the Middle East and North Africa region.205 The country lost this status with the outbreak of the Civil War and has not regained it since. Lebanon was rated Partly Free in 2013. Even so Freedom House still ranks Lebanon as among the most democratic nations in the Arab world.205 According to the VDem Democracy indices Lebanon is 2023 the second most electoral democratic country in the Middle East.206 Until 2005 Palestinians were forbidden to work in over 70 jobs because they did not have Lebanese citizenship. After liberalization laws were passed in 2007 the number of banned jobs dropped to around 
20.7 5 In 2010 Palestinians were granted the same rights to work as other foreigners in the country.207 Lebanons national legislature is the unicameral Parliament of Lebanon. Its 128 seats are divided equally between Christians and Muslims proportionately between the 18 different denominations and proportionately between its 26 regions.208 Prior to 1990 the ratio stood at 65 in favor of Christians but the Taif Agreement which put an end to the 19751990 civil war adjusted the ratio to grant equal representation to followers of the two religions.201 One of many protests in Beirut The Parliament is elected for a fouryear term by popular vote on the basis of sectarian proportional representation.12 The executive branch consists of the President the head of state and the Prime Minister the head of government. The parliament elects the president for a nonrenewable sixyear term by a twothirds majority. The president appoints the Prime Minister209 following consultations with the parliament. The president and the prime minister form a cabinet which must also adhere to the sectarian distribution set out by confessionalism. In an unprecedented move the Lebanese parliament has extended its own term twice amid protests the last being on 5 November 2014210 an act which comes in direct contradiction with democracy and article 42 of the Lebanese constitution as no elections have taken place.6 Lebanon was without a President between May 2014 and October 20
16.2 11212 Nationwide elections were finally scheduled for May 20
18.2 13 As of August 2019 the Lebanese cabinet included two ministers directly affiliated with Hezbollah in addition to a close but officially nonmember minister.214 The most recent parliamentary elections were held on 15 May 20
22.2 15 Law Grand Serail from Riad El Solh Square Beruit There are 18 officially recognized religious groups in Lebanon each with its own family law legislation and set of religious courts.216 The Lebanese legal system is based on the French system and is a civil law country with the exception for matters related to personal status succession marriage divorce adoption etc. which are governed by a separate set of laws designed for each sectarian community. For instance the Islamic personal status laws are inspired by the Sharia law.217 For Muslims these tribunals deal with questions of marriage divorce custody and inheritance and wills. For nonMuslims personal status jurisdiction is split the law of inheritance and wills falls under national civil jurisdiction while Christian and Jewish religious courts are competent for marriage divorce and custody. Catholics can additionally appeal before the Vatican Rota court.218 The most notable set of codified laws is the Code des Obligations et des Contrats promulgated in 1932 and equivalent to the French Civil Code.217 Capital punishment is still de facto used to sanction certain crimes but no longer enforced.217 The Lebanese court system consists of three levels courts of first instance courts of appeal and the court of cassation. The Constitutional Council rules on constitutionality of laws and electoral frauds. There also is a system of religious courts having jurisdiction over personal status matters within their own communities with rules on matters such as marriage and inheritance.219 In 1990 article 95 was amended to provide that the parliament shall take necessary measures to abolish political structure based on religious affiliation but that until such time only the highest positions in public civil service including the judiciary military security forces public and mixed institutions shall be divided equally between Christians and Muslims without regard to the denominational affiliation within each community.220 Foreign relations Main article Foreign relations of Lebanon United Nations Lebanon headquarters in Beirut Lebanon concluded negotiations on an association agreement with the European Union in late 2001 and both sides initialed the accord in January 2002. It is included in the European Unions European Neighbourhood Policy ENP which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer. Lebanon also has bilateral trade agreements with several Arab states and is working toward accession to the World Trade Organization. Lebanon enjoys good relations with virtually all of the other Arab countries despite historic tensions with Libya and Syria and hosted an Arab League Summit in March 2002 for the first time in over 35 years. Lebanon is a member of the Francophonie countries and hosted the Francophonie Summit in October 2002 as well as the Jeux de la Francophonie in 2009. Military Main article Lebanese Armed Forces Soldiers of the Lebanese army 2009 The Lebanese Armed Forces LAF has 72000 active personnel221 including 1100 in the air force and 1000 in the navy.222 The LAF is considered less powerful and influential than Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hezbollah has 20000 active fighters and 20000 in reserves and is supplied with advanced weaponry including rockets and drones from Iran.223224 The Lebanese Armed Forces primary missions include defending Lebanon and its citizens against external aggression maintaining internal stability and security confronting threats against the countrys vital interests engaging in social development activities and undertaking relief operations in coordination with public and humanitarian institutions.225 Lebanon is a major recipient of foreign military aid.226 With over 400 million since 2005 it is the second largest per capita recipient of American military aid behind Israel.227 LGBT rights Main article LGBT rights in Lebanon Male homosexuality is illegal in Lebanon.228 Discrimination against LGBT people in Lebanon is widespread.229230 According to 2019 survey by the Pew Research Center 85 of Lebanese respondents believe that homosexuality should not be accepted by society.231 A gender and sexuality conference held annually in Lebanon since 2013 was moved abroad in 2019 after a religious group on Facebook called for the organizers arrest and the cancellation of the conference for inciting immorality. General Security Forces shut down the 2018 conference and indefinitely denied nonLebanese LGBT activists who attended the conference permission to reenter the country.232 Administrative divisions Main articles Governorates of Lebanon Districts of Lebanon and Municipalities of Lebanon Lebanon is divided into nine governorates mufat Arabic  singular mufaah Arabic  which are further subdivided into twentyfive districts aqdyah Arabic  singular qad Arabic .233 The districts themselves are also divided into several municipalities each enclosing a group of cities or villages.

Lebanons economy follows a laissezfaire model.234 Most of the economy is dollarized and the country has no restrictions on the movement of capital across its borders.234 The Lebanese governments intervention in foreign trade is minimal.234 The Investment Development Authority of Lebanon was established with the aim of promoting investment in Lebanon. In 2001 Investment Law No.360235 was enacted to reinforce the organisations mission. Lebanon is now suffering the worst economic crisis in decades.151152 As of 2023 the GDP has shrunk by 40 since 2018 and the currency has experienced a significant depreciation of 
95.2 36 The annual inflation rate exceeds 200 rendering the minimum wage equivalent to approximately 1 per day.237 This was the first time Lebanon had devalued its official exchange rate in 25 years.169 According to the United Nations three out of every four Lebanese individuals fall below the poverty line.237 The crisis stems from a longterm Ponzi scheme by the Central Bank of Lebanon borrowing dollars at high interest rates to sustain deficits and maintain a currency peg. By 2019 insufficient new deposits led to an unsustainable situation resulting in weekslong bank closures arbitrary capital controls and ultimately the countrys default in 20
20.2 38 Throughout the Ottoman and French mandatory periods and into the 19
60 s Lebanon experienced prosperity serving as a hub for banking financial services and a key distribution center for the Middle East. The local economy thrived with a foundation in industries related to food processing clothing jewelry and carpets. This prosperity was later marred by four decades of conflict.200 Following the end of the civil war Lebanon has developed a servicebased economy centered around finance real estate and tourism.239 Nearly 65 of the Lebanese workforce attain employment in the services sector.240 The GDP contribution accordingly amounts to roughly 
67.3  of the annual Lebanese GDP.17 However dependence on the tourism and banking sectors leaves the economy vulnerable to political instability.18 The urban population in Lebanon is noted for its commercial enterprise.241 Emigration has yielded Lebanese commercial networks throughout the world.242 In 2008 Remittances from Lebanese abroad totalled 
8.2  billion243 and account for onefifth of the countrys economy.244 In 2005 Lebanon had the largest proportion of skilled labor among Arab States.245 Agriculture The agricultural sector in Lebanon employs 2025 of the total workforce246 and contributed 
3.1  to the countrys GDP247 as of 2020. Lebanon has the highest proportion of cultivable land in the Arab world.248 Major crops include apples peaches oranges and lemons.17 A significant portion of the countrys factories approximately onethird is dedicated to producing packaged food items ranging from poultry to pickles.246 However despite favorable conditions for farming and diverse microclimates the country depends on food imports constituting 80 of its consumption. This is mainly attributed to the small scale of many farms preventing the benefits of economies of scale.246 The ongoing economic crisis and devaluation of the Lebanese pound have also negatively impacted the agricultural sector particularly through elevated costs for essential imports such as seeds and fertilizers. This economic strain compounds existing burdens for farmers including escalating debts and inefficient agricultural practices. Consequently farmers are observing a decline in revenues and encountering difficulties in meeting loan repayment obligations.246249 The commodities market in Lebanon includes substantial gold coin production however according to International Air Transport Association IATA standards they must be declared upon exportation to any foreign country.250 Manufacturing and Industry Industry in Lebanon is mainly limited to small businesses that reassemble and package imported parts. In 2004 industry ranked second in workforce with 26 of the Lebanese working population240 and second in GDP contribution with 21 of Lebanons GDP.17 Oil has recently been discovered inland and in the seabed between Lebanon Cyprus Israel and Egypt and talks are underway between Cyprus and Egypt to reach an agreement regarding the exploration of these resources. The seabed separating Lebanon and Cyprus is believed to hold significant quantities of crude oil and natural gas.251 On 10 May 2013 the Lebanese minister of energy and water clarified that seismic images of the Lebanese sea bed are undergoing detailed explanation of their contents and that up till now approximately 10 have been covered. Preliminary inspection of the results showed with over 50 probability that 10 of Lebanons exclusive economic zone held up to 660 million barrels of oil and up to 301012 cu ft of gas.252 Lebanon has a significant drug industry including both production and trade. Western intelligence estimate an annual production of over 4 million pounds of hashish and 20000 pounds of heroin generating profits exceeding 4 billion. In recent decades Hezbollah has intensified its engagement in the drug economy with narcotics serving as a significant revenue stream for the group. Despite some of the harvest being retained for local use a significant amount is smuggled worldwide.

His Thongchai Winichakuls study shows that the modern map in some cases predicted the nation instead of just recording it rather than describing existing borders it created the reality it was assumed to depict. The power of the map over the mind was greatHow could a nation resist being found if a nineteenthcentury map had predicted it In the Middle East Lebanon seems to offer a corresponding example. When the idea of a Greater Lebanon in 1908 was put forward in a book by Bulus Nujaym a Lebanese Maronite writing under the pseudonym of M. Jouplain he suggested that the natural boundaries of Lebanon were exactly the same as drawn in the 1861 and 1863 staff maps of the French military expedition to Syria maps that added territories on the northern eastern and southern borders plus the city of Beirut to the Mutasarrifiyya of Mount Lebanon. In this case too the prior existence of a European military map seems to have created a fact on the ground.  Youssef KARAM I b. May 1823 d. 7 Apr 1889. Ehden Family Tree.
