It was concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River situated in the place that is now the country Egypt. Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC according to conventional Egyptian chronology1 with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes often identified with Narmer.2 The history of ancient Egypt unfolded as a series of stable kingdoms interspersed by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods. The various kingdoms fall into one of three categories the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age or the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. Ancient Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom ruling much of Nubia and a sizable portion of the Levant. After this period it entered an era of slow decline. During the course of its history Ancient Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers including the Hyksos the Nubians the Assyrians the Achaemenid Persians and the Macedonians under Alexander the Great. The Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom formed in the aftermath of Alexanders death ruled until 30 BC when under Cleopatra it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province.3 Egypt remained under Roman control until the 6
40 s AD when it was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate. The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture. The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops which supported a more dense population and social development and culture. With resources to spare the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions the early development of an independent writing system the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects trade with surrounding regions and a military intended to assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes religious leaders and administrators under the control of a pharaoh who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs.4 The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids temples and obelisks a system of mathematics a practical and effective system of medicine irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques the first known planked boats5 Egyptian faience and glass technology new forms of literature and the earliest known peace treaty made with the Hittites.6 Ancient Egypt has left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied and its antiquities were carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for millennia. A newfound respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians has led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.7 History Main articles History of ancient Egypt and Population history of Egypt The Nile has been the lifeline of its region for much of human history.8 The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization.9 Nomadic modern human huntergatherers began living in the Nile valley through the end of the Middle Pleistocene some 120000 years ago. By the late Paleolithic period the arid climate of Northern Africa had become increasingly hot and dry forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region. Predynastic period Main article Predynastic Egypt A typical Naqada II jar decorated with gazelles Predynastic Period In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times the Egyptian climate was much less arid than it is today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates. Foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians and this is also the period when many animals were first domesticated.10 By about 5500 BC small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed into a series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry and identifiable by their pottery and personal items such as combs bracelets and beads. The largest of these early cultures in upper Southern Egypt was the Badarian culture which probably originated in the Western Desert it was known for its highquality ceramics stone tools and its use of copper.11 The Badari was followed by the Naqada culture the Naqada I Amratian the Naqada II Gerzeh and Naqada III Semainean.12 These brought a number of technological improvements. As early as the Naqada I Period predynastic Egyptians imported obsidian from Ethiopia used to shape blades and other objects from flakes.1314 Mutual trade with the Levant was established during Naqada II c.36003350 BC this period was also the beginning of trade with Mesopotamia which continued into the early dynastic period and beyond.15 Over a period of about 1000 years the Naqada culture developed from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders were in complete control of the people and resources of the Nile valley.16 Establishing a power center at Nekhen in Greek Hierakonpolis and later at Abydos Naqada III leaders expanded their control of Egypt northwards along the Nile.17 They also traded with Nubia to the south the oases of the western desert to the west and the cultures of the eastern Mediterranean and Near East to the east.
18 when The Naqada culture manufactured a diverse selection of material goods reflective of the increasing power and wealth of the elite as well as societal personaluse items which included combs small statuary painted pottery high quality decorative stone vases cosmetic palettes and jewelry made of gold lapis and ivory. They also developed a ceramic glaze known as faience which was used well into the Roman Period to decorate cups amulets and figurines.1920 During the last predynastic phase the Naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed into a full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient Egyptian language.21 Early tomb painting from Nekhen c.3500 BC Naqada possibly Gerzeh culture Early Dynastic Period c. 31502686 BC Main article Early Dynastic Period Egypt The Early Dynastic Period was approximately contemporary to the early SumerianAkkadian civilization of Mesopotamia and of ancient Elam. The thirdcentury BC Egyptian priest Manetho grouped the long line of kings from Menes to his own time into 30 dynasties a system still used today. He began his official history with the king named Meni or Menes in Greek who was believed to have united the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt.22 The Narmer Palette depicts the unification of the Two Lands.23 The transition to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers represented and there is no contemporary record of Menes. Some scholars now believe however that the mythical Menes may have been the king Narmer who is depicted wearing royal regalia on the ceremonial Narmer Palette in a symbolic act of unification.24 In the Early Dynastic Period which began about 3000 BC the first of the Dynastic kings solidified control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at Memphis from which he could control the labor force and agriculture of the fertile delta region as well as the lucrative and critical trade routes to the Levant. The increasing power and wealth of the kings during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate mastaba tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos which were used to celebrate the deified king after his death.25 The strong institution of kingship developed by the kings served to legitimize state control over the land labor and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.26 Old Kingdom 26862181 BC Main article Old Kingdom of Egypt The pyramids of Giza are among the most recognizable symbols of ancient Egyptian civilization. Major advances in architecture art and technology were made during the Old Kingdom fueled by the increased agricultural productivity and resulting population made possible by a welldeveloped central administration.27 Some of ancient Egypts crowning achievements the Giza pyramids and Great Sphinx were constructed during the Old Kingdom. Under the direction of the vizier state officials collected taxes coordinated irrigation projects to improve crop yield drafted peasants to work on construction projects and established a justice system to maintain peace and order.28 Khafre enthroned With the rising importance of central administration in Egypt a new class of educated scribes and officials arose who were granted estates by the king in payment for their services. Kings also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the king after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic vitality of Egypt and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration.29 As the power of the kings diminished regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the office of king. This coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150 BC30 is believed to have caused the country to enter the 1
40 year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.31 First Intermediate Period 21812055 BC Main article First Intermediate Period of Egypt After Egypts central government collapsed at the end of the Old Kingdom the administration could no longer support or stabilize the countrys economy. Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and smallscale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems local leaders owing no tribute to the king used their newfound independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources the provinces became economically richerwhich was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes.32 In bursts of creativity provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period.33 Free from their loyalties to the king local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and political power. By 2160 BC rulers in Herakleopolis controlled Lower Egypt in the north while a rival clan based in Thebes the Intef family took control of Upper Egypt in the south. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055 BC the northern Theban forces under Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers reuniting the Two Lands. They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the Middle Kingdom.34 Middle Kingdom 21341690 BC Main article Middle Kingdom of Egypt A figure wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt most probably Amenemhat II or Senwosret II. It functioned as a divine guardian for the imiut the divine kilt suggests that the statuette was not merely a representation of the living ruler.35 Pyramidion of Amenemhat III capstone of the Black Pyramid Coffin of Khnumnakht in 
12 th dynasty style with palace facade columns of inscriptions and two Wedjat eyes36 The kings of the Middle Kingdom restored the countrys stability and prosperity thereby stimulating a resurgence of art literature and monumental building projects.37 Mentuhotep II and his Eleventh Dynasty successors ruled from Thebes but the vizier Amenemhat I upon assuming the kingship at the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty around 1985 BC shifted the kingdoms capital to the city of Itjtawy located in Faiyum.38 From Itjtawy the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty undertook a farsighted land reclamation and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region. Moreover the military reconquered territory in Nubia that was rich in quarries and gold mines while laborers built a defensive structure in the Eastern Delta called the Walls of the Ruler to defend against foreign attack.39 With the kings having secured the country militarily and politically and with vast agricultural and mineral wealth at their disposal the nations population arts and religion flourished. In contrast to elitist Old Kingdom attitudes towards the gods the Middle Kingdom displayed an increase in expressions of personal piety.40 Middle Kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident eloquent style.33 The relief and portrait sculpture of the period captured subtle individual details that reached new heights of technical sophistication.41 The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom Amenemhat III allowed Semiticspeaking Canaanite settlers from the Near East into the Delta region to provide a sufficient labor force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and mining activities however combined with severe Nile floods later in his reign strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties. During this decline the Canaanite settlers began to assume greater control of the Delta region eventually coming to power in Egypt as the Hyksos.42 Second Intermediate Period 16741549 BC and the Hyksos Main article Second Intermediate Period of Egypt Around 1785 BC as the power of the Middle Kingdom kings weakened a Western Asian people called the Hyksos who had already settled in the Delta seized control of Egypt and established their capital at Avaris forcing the former central government to retreat to Thebes. The king was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute.43 The Hyksos foreign rulers retained Egyptian models of government and identified as kings thereby integrating Egyptian elements into their culture. They and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt most notably the composite bow and the horsedrawn chariot.44 After retreating south the native Theban kings found themselves trapped between the Canaanite Hyksos ruling the north and the Hyksos Nubian allies the Kushites to the south. After years of vassalage Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years until 1555 BC.43 The kings Seqenenre Tao II and Kamose were ultimately able to defeat the Nubians to the south of Egypt but failed to defeat the Hyksos. That task fell to Kamoses successor Ahmose I who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos presence in Egypt. He established a new dynasty and in the New Kingdom that followed the military became a central priority for the kings who sought to expand Egypts borders and attempted to gain mastery of the Near East.45 New Kingdom 15491069 BC Main article New Kingdom of Egypt Pharaohs tombs were provided with vast quantities of wealth such as the golden mask from the mummy of Tutankhamun. The New Kingdom pharaohs established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbours including the Mitanni Empire Assyria and Canaan. Military campaigns waged under Tuthmosis I and his grandson Tuthmosis III extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen. Beginning with Merneptah the rulers of Egypt adopted the title of pharaoh. Between their reigns Hatshepsut a queen who established herself as pharaoh launched many building projects including the restoration of temples damaged by the Hyksos and sent trading expeditions to Punt and the Sinai.46 When Tuthmosis III died in 1425 BC Egypt had an empire extending from Niya in north west Syria to the Fourth Cataract of the Nile in Nubia cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as bronze and wood.47 The New Kingdom pharaohs began a largescale building campaign to promote the god Amun whose growing cult was based in Karnak. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements both real and imagined. The Karnak temple is the largest Egyptian temple ever built.48 Around 1350 BC the stability of the New Kingdom was threatened when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to Akhenaten he touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity suppressed the worship of most other deities and moved the capital to the new city of Akhetaten modernday Amarna.49 He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style. After his death the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned and the traditional religious order restored. The subsequent pharaohs Tutankhamun Ay and Horemheb worked to erase all mention of Akhenatens heresy now known as the Amarna Period.50 Four colossal statues of Ramesses II flank the entrance of his temple Abu Simbel Around 1279 BC Ramesses II also known as Ramesses the Great ascended the throne and went on to build more temples erect more statues and obelisks and sire more children than any other pharaoh in history.c A bold military leader Ramesses II led his army against the Hittites in the Battle of Kadesh in modern Syria and after fighting to a stalemate finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty around 1258 BC.51 Egypts wealth however made it a tempting target for invasion particularly by the Libyan Berbers to the west and the Sea Peoples a conjectured confederation of seafarers from the Aegean Sea.d Initially the military was able to repel these invasions but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern Canaan much of it falling to the Assyrians. The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption tomb robbery and civil unrest. After regaining their power the high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.52 Third Intermediate Period 1069653 BC Main article Third Intermediate Period of Egypt Following the death of Ramesses XI in 1078 BC Smendes assumed authority over the northern part of Egypt ruling from the city of Tanis. The south was effectively controlled by the High Priests of Amun at Thebes who recognized Smendes in name only.53 During this time Libyans had been settling in the western delta and chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy. Libyan princes took control of the delta under Shoshenq I in 945 BC founding the socalled Libyan or Bubastite dynasty that would rule for some 200 years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in Leontopolis and Kushites threatened from the south.

25 th Dynasty.55 During the 
25 th Dynasty Pharaoh Taharqa created an empire nearly as large as the New Kingdoms. Twentyfifth Dynasty pharaohs built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley including at Memphis Karnak Kawa and Jebel Barkal.56 During this period the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids many in modern Sudan since the Middle Kingdom.575859 Egypts farreaching prestige declined considerably toward the end of the Third Intermediate Period. Its foreign allies had fallen under the Assyrian sphere of influence and by 700 BC war between the two states became inevitable. Between 671 and 667 BC the Assyrians began the Assyrian conquest of Egypt. The reigns of both Taharqa and his successor Tanutamun were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians against whom Egypt enjoyed several victories. Ultimately the Assyrians pushed the Kushites back into Nubia occupied Memphis and sacked the temples of Thebes.60 Late Period 653332 BC Main articles Late Period of ancient Egypt and History of Persian Egypt The Assyrians left control of Egypt to a series of vassals who became known as the Saite kings of the TwentySixth Dynasty. By 653 BC the Saite king Psamtik I was able to oust the Assyrians with the help of Greek mercenaries who were recruited to form Egypts first navy. Greek influence expanded greatly as the citystate of Naucratis became the home of Greeks in the Nile Delta. The Saite kings based in the new capital of Sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture but in 525 BC the powerful Persians led by Cambyses II began their conquest of Egypt eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the Battle of Pelusium. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh but ruled Egypt from Iran leaving Egypt under the control of a satrap. A few successful revolts against the Persians marked the 
5 th century BC but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.61 Following its annexation by Persia Egypt was joined with Cyprus and Phoenicia in the sixth satrapy of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. This first period of Persian rule over Egypt also known as the TwentySeventh Dynasty ended in 402 BC when Egypt regained independence under a series of native dynasties. The last of these dynasties the Thirtieth proved to be the last native royal house of ancient Egypt ending with the kingship of Nectanebo II. A brief restoration of Persian rule sometimes known as the ThirtyFirst Dynasty began in 343 BC but shortly after in 332 BC the Persian ruler Mazaces handed Egypt over to Alexander the Great without a fight.62 Ptolemaic period 33230 BC Main article Ptolemaic Kingdom Portrait of Ptolemy VI Philometor wearing the double crown of Egypt In 332 BC Alexander the Great conquered Egypt with little resistance from the Persians and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer. The administration established by Alexanders successors the Macedonian Ptolemaic Kingdom was based on an Egyptian model and based in the new capital city of Alexandria. The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule and became a centre of learning and culture that included the famous Library of Alexandria as part of the Mouseion.63 The Lighthouse of Alexandria lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the cityas the Ptolemies made commerce and revenuegenerating enterprises such as papyrus manufacturing their top priority.64 Hellenistic culture did not supplant native Egyptian culture as the Ptolemies supported timehonored traditions in an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace. They built new temples in Egyptian style supported traditional cults and portrayed themselves as pharaohs. Some traditions merged as Greek and Egyptian gods were syncretized into composite deities such as Serapis and classical Greek forms of sculpture influenced traditional Egyptian motifs. Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians the Ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion bitter family rivalries and the powerful mob of Alexandria that formed after the death of Ptolemy IV.65 In addition as Rome relied more heavily on imports of grain from Egypt the Romans took great interest in the political situation in the country. Continued Egyptian revolts ambitious politicians and powerful opponents from the Near East made this situation unstable leading Rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire.66 Roman period 30 BC  AD 641 The Fayum mummy portraits epitomize the meeting of Egyptian and Roman cultures. Main article Roman Egypt Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire in 30 BC following the defeat of Mark Antony and Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII by Octavian later Emperor Augustus in the Battle of Actium. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt and the Roman army under the control of a prefect appointed by the emperor quelled rebellions strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes and prevented attacks by bandits which had become a notorious problem during the period.67 Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.68 Although the Romans had a more hostile attitude than the Greeks towards the Egyptians some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued.69 The art of mummy portraiture flourished and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs though not to the extent that the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.69 From the midfirst century AD Christianity took root in Egypt and it was originally seen as another cult that could be accepted. However it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from the pagan Egyptian and GrecoRoman religions and threatened popular religious traditions. This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity culminating in the great purges of Diocletian starting in 303 but eventually Christianity won out.70 In 391 the Christian emperor Theodosius introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples.71 Alexandria became the scene of great antipagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed.72 As a consequence Egypts native religious culture was continually in decline. While the native population continued to speak their language the ability to read hieroglyphic writing slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.73 In the fourth century as the Roman Empire divided Egypt found itself in the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. In the waning years of the Empire Egypt fell to the Sasanian Persian army in the Sasanian conquest of Egypt 618628. It was then recaptured by the Byzantine emperor Heraclius 629639 and was finally captured by Muslim Rashidun army in 639641 marking the end of both Byzantine rule and of the period typically considered Ancient Egypt.citation needed Government and economy Administration and commerce The pharaoh was usually depicted wearing symbols of royalty and power. The pharaoh was the absolute monarch of the country and at least in theory wielded complete control of the land and its resources. The king was the supreme military commander and head of the government who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs. In charge of the administration was his second in command the vizier who acted as the kings representative and coordinated land surveys the treasury building projects the legal system and the archives.74 At a regional level the country was divided into as many as 42 administrative regions called nomes each governed by a nomarch who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction. The temples formed the backbone of the economy. Not only were they places of worship but were also responsible for collecting and storing the kingdoms wealth in a system of granaries and treasuries administered by overseers who redistributed grain and goods.75 Much of the economy was centrally organized and strictly controlled. Although the ancient Egyptians did not use coinage until the Late period76 they did use a type of moneybarter system77 with standard sacks of grain and the deben a weight of roughly 91 grams 3 oz of copper or silver forming a common denominator.78 Workers were paid in grain a simple laborer might earn 512 sacks 200 kg or 400 lb of grain per month while a foreman might earn 712 sacks 250 kg or 550 lb. Prices were fixed across the country and recorded in lists to facilitate trading for example a shirt cost five copper deben while a cow cost 140 deben.78 Grain could be traded for other goods according to the fixed price list.78 During the fifth century BC coined money was introduced into Egypt from abroad. At first the coins were used as standardized pieces of precious metal rather than true money but in the following centuries international traders came to rely on coinage.79 Social status Painted limestone relief of a noble member of Ancient Egyptian society during the New Kingdom Egyptian society was highly stratified and social status was expressly displayed. Farmers made up the bulk of the population but agricultural produce was owned directly by the state temple or noble family that owned the land.80 Farmers were also subject to a labor tax and were required to work on irrigation or construction projects in a corve system.81 Artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers but they were also under state control working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury. Scribes and officials formed the upper class in ancient Egypt known as the white kilt class in reference to the bleached linen garments that served as a mark of their rank.82 The upper class prominently displayed their social status in art and literature. Below the nobility were the priests physicians and engineers with specialized training in their field. It is unclear whether slavery as understood today existed in ancient Egypt there is difference of opinions among authors.83 The ancient Egyptians viewed men and women including people from all social classes as essentially equal under the law and even the lowliest peasant was entitled to petition the vizier and his court for redress.84 Although slaves were mostly used as indentured servants they were able to buy and sell their servitude work their way to freedom or nobility and were usually treated by doctors in the workplace.85 Both men and women had the right to own and sell property make contracts marry and divorce receive inheritance and pursue legal disputes in court. Married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end. Compared with their counterparts in ancient Greece Rome and even more modern places around the world ancient Egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices legal rights and opportunities for achievement. Women such as Hatshepsut and Cleopatra VII even became pharaohs while others wielded power as Divine Wives of Amun. Despite these freedoms ancient Egyptian women did not often take part in official roles in the administration aside from the royal high priestesses apparently served only secondary roles in the temples not much data for many dynasties and were not so likely to be as educated as men.84 Legal system The Seated Scribe from Saqqara 
5 th dynasty The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh who was responsible for enacting laws delivering justice and maintaining law and order a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Maat.74 Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a commonsense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes.84 Local councils of elders known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes.74 More serious cases involving murder major land transactions and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any coconspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious court scribes documented the complaint testimony and verdict of the case for future reference.86 Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines beatings facial mutilation or exile depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution carried out by decapitation drowning or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminals family.74 Beginning in the New Kingdom oracles played a major role in the legal system dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a yes or no question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god carried by a number of priests rendered judgement by choosing one or the other moving forward or backward or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon.87 Agriculture Measuring and recording the harvest from the tomb of Menna at Thebes Eighteenth Dynasty.

18 th Dynasty Main article Ancient Egyptian agriculture See also Gardens of ancient Egypt A combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural technological and artistic pursuits. Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.88 Farming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons Akhet flooding Peret planting and Shemu harvesting. The flooding season lasted from June to September depositing on the rivers banks a layer of mineralrich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded the growing season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops.89 From March to May farmers used sickles to harvest their crops which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain. Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain and the grain was then ground into flour brewed to make beer or stored for later use.90 The ancient Egyptians cultivated emmer and barley and several other cereal grains all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer.91 Flax plants uprooted before they started flowering were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing. Papyrus growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots close to habitations and on higher ground and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks garlic melons squashes pulses lettuce and other crops in addition to grapes that were made into wine.92 A tomb relief depicts workers plowing the fields harvesting the crops and threshing the grain under the direction of an overseer painting in the tomb of Nakht Animals Sennedjem plows his fields in Aaru with a pair of oxen Deir elMedina The Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and animals was an essential element of the cosmic order thus humans animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole.93 Animals both domesticated and wild were therefore a critical source of spirituality companionship and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle the ancient Egyptians kept sheep goats and pigs. Poultry such as ducks geese and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms where they were forcefed with dough to fatten them.94 The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom and provided both honey and wax.95 The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and oxen as beasts of burden and they were responsible for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil. The slaughter of a fattened ox was also a central part of an offering ritual. Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period. Camels although known from the New Kingdom were not used as beasts of burden until the Late Period. There is also evidence to suggest that elephants were briefly used in the Late Period but largely abandoned due to lack of grazing land.94 Cats dogs and monkeys were common family pets while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa such as SubSaharan African lions96 were reserved for royalty. Herodotus observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses.93 During the Late Period the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular such as the cat goddess Bastet and the ibis god Thoth and these animals were kept in large numbers for the purpose of ritual sacrifice.97 Natural resources Further information Mining industry of Egypt and Stone quarries of ancient Egypt Egypt is rich in building and decorative stone copper and lead ores gold and semiprecious stones. These natural resources allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments sculpt statues make tools and fashion jewelry.98 Embalmers used salts from the Wadi Natrun for mummification which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster.99 Orebearing rock formations were found in distant inhospitable wadis in the Eastern Desert and the Sinai requiring large statecontrolled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there. There were extensive gold mines in Nubia and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The Wadi Hammamat was a notable source of granite greywacke and gold. Flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose.100 Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as sulfur as cosmetic substances.101 The Egyptians worked deposits of the lead ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers plumb bobs and small figurines. Copper was the most important metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai.102 Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits or by the more laborintensive process of grinding and washing goldbearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were used in the Late Period.103 Highquality building stones were abundant in Egypt the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley granite from Aswan and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the Eastern Desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry greywacke alabaster and carnelian dotted the Eastern Desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods miners worked deposits of emeralds in Wadi Sikait and amethyst in Wadi elHudi.104 Trade Main article Ancient Egyptian trade Hatshepsuts trading expedition to the Land of Punt The ancient Egyptians engaged in trade with their foreign neighbors to obtain rare exotic goods not found in Egypt. In the Predynastic Period they established trade with Nubia to obtain gold and incense. They also established trade with Palestine as evidenced by Palestinianstyle oil jugs found in the burials of the First Dynasty pharaohs.105 An Egyptian colony stationed in southern Canaan dates to slightly before the First Dynasty.106 Narmer had Egyptian pottery produced in Canaan and exported back to Egypt.107108 By the Second Dynasty at latest ancient Egyptian trade with Byblos yielded a critical source of quality timber not found in Egypt. By the Fifth Dynasty trade with Punt provided gold aromatic resins ebony ivory and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons.109 Egypt relied on trade with Anatolia for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze. The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone lapis lazuli which had to be imported from faraway Afghanistan. Egypts Mediterranean trade partners also included Greece and Crete which provided among other goods supplies of olive oil.110 Language Main article Egyptian language Historical development r n kmt Egyptian language in hieroglyphs The Egyptian language is a northern AfroAsiatic language closely related to the Berber and Semitic languages.111 It has the longest known history of any language having been written from c. 3200 BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. The phases of ancient Egyptian are Old Egyptian Middle Egyptian Classical Egyptian Late Egyptian Demotic and Coptic.112 Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.113 Ancient Egyptian was a synthetic language but it became more analytic later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. There was a change from the older verbsubjectobject word order to subjectverbobject.114 The Egyptian hieroglyphic hieratic and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church and traces of it are found in modern Egyptian Arabic.115 Sounds and grammar Ancient Egyptian has 25 consonants similar to those of other AfroAsiatic languages. These include pharyngeal and emphatic consonants voiced and voiceless stops voiceless fricatives and voiced and voiceless affricates. It has three long and three short vowels which expanded in Late Egyptian to about nine.116 The basic word in Egyptian similar to Semitic and Berber is a triliteral or biliteral root of consonants and semiconsonants. Suffixes are added to form words. The verb conjugation corresponds to the person. For example the triconsonantal skeleton SM is the semantic core of the word hear its basic conjugation is sm he hears. If the subject is a noun suffixes are not added to the verb117 sm mt the woman hears. Adjectives are derived from nouns through a process that Egyptologists call nisbation because of its similarity with Arabic.118 The word order is predicatesubject in verbal and adjectival sentences and subjectpredicate in nominal and adverbial sentences.119 The subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun.120 Verbs and nouns are negated by the particle n but nn is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences. Stress falls on the ultimate or penultimate syllable which can be open CV or closed CVC.121 Writing The Rosetta Stone c. 196 BC enabled linguists to begin deciphering ancient Egyptian scripts.122 Hieroglyphic writing dates from c. 3000 BC and is composed of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word a sound or a silent determinative and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script used on stone monuments and in tombs that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In daytoday writing scribes used a cursive form of writing called hieratic which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction though typically written from right to left hieratic was always written from right to left usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing Demotic became the prevalent writing style and it is this form of writingalong with formal hieroglyphsthat accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.123 Around the first century AD the Coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified Greek alphabet with the addition of some Demotic signs.124 Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine125 and Islamic periods in Egypt126 but only in the 18
20 s after the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and years of research by Thomas Young and JeanFranois Champollion were hieroglyphs substantially deciphered.127 Literature Main article Ancient Egyptian literature Hieroglyphs on stela in Louvre c. 1321 BC Writing first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs. It was primarily an occupation of the scribes who worked out of the Per Ankh institution or the House of Life. The latter comprised offices libraries called House of Books laboratories and observatories.128 Some of the bestknown pieces of ancient Egyptian literature such as the Pyramid and Coffin Texts were written in Classical Egyptian which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300 BC. Late Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in Ramesside administrative documents love poetry and tales as well as in Demotic and Coptic texts. During this period the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography such as those of Harkhuf and Weni. The genre known as Sebayt instructions was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles the Ipuwer papyrus a poem of lamentations describing natural disasters and social upheaval is a famous example. The Story of Sinuhe written in Middle Egyptian might be the classic of Egyptian literature.129 Also written at this time was the Westcar Papyrus a set of stories told to Khufu by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests.130 The Instruction of Amenemope is considered a masterpiece of Near Eastern literature.131 Towards the end of the New Kingdom the vernacular language was more often employed to write popular pieces like the Story of Wenamun and the Instruction of Any. The former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt. From about 700 BC narrative stories and instructions such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy as well as personal and business documents were written in the demotic script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories written in demotic during the GrecoRoman period were set in previous historical eras when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as Ramesses II.132 Culture Daily life Further information Clothing in ancient Egypt Dance in ancient Egypt and Music of Egypt  Old Kingdom Lowerclass occupations Most ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land. Their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members and were constructed of mudbrick designed to remain cool in the heat of the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread.133 Ceramics served as household wares for the storage preparation transport and consumption of food drink and raw materials. Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats while wooden stools beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.134 Egyptians celebrated feasts and festivals accompanied by music and dance. The ancient Egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance. Most bathed in the Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness perfumes and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin.135 Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs jewelry and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity at about age 12 and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children while the father provided the familys income.136 Music and dance were popular entertainments for those who could afford them. Early instruments included flutes and harps while instruments similar to trumpets oboes and pipes developed later and became popular. In the New Kingdom the Egyptians played on bells cymbals tambourines drums and imported lutes and lyres from Asia.137 The sistrum was a rattlelike musical instrument that was especially important in religious ceremonies. Ruins of Deir elMedina The ancient Egyptians enjoyed a variety of leisure activities including games and music. Senet a board game where pieces moved according to random chance was particularly popular from the earliest times another similar game was mehen which had a circular gaming board. Hounds and Jackals also known as 58 holes is another example of board games played in ancient Egypt. The first complete set of this game was discovered from a Theban tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Amenemhat IV that dates to the 
13 th Dynasty.138 Juggling and ball games were popular with children and wrestling is also documented in a tomb at Beni Hasan.139 The wealthy members of ancient Egyptian society enjoyed hunting fishing and boating as well. The excavation of the workers village of Deir elMedina has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world which spans almost four hundred years. There is no comparable site in which the organization social interactions and working and living conditions of a community have been studied in such detail.140 Cuisine Main article Ancient Egyptian cuisine Hunting game birds and plowing a field tomb of Nefermaat and his wife Itet c.2700 BC Egyptian cuisine remained remarkably stable over time indeed the cuisine of modern Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients. The staple diet consisted of bread and beer supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish meat and fowl could be salted or dried and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.141 Architecture Main article Ancient Egyptian architecture The architecture of ancient Egypt includes some of the most famous structures in the world the Great Pyramids of Giza and the temples at Thebes. Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes but also to reinforce the wideranging power of the pharaoh. The ancient Egyptians were skilled builders using only simple but effective tools and sighting instruments architects could build large stone structures with great accuracy and precision that is still envied today.142 The domestic dwellings of elite and ordinary Egyptians alike were constructed from perishable materials such as mudbricks and wood and have not survived. Peasants lived in simple homes while the palaces of the elite and the pharaoh were more elaborate structures. A few surviving New Kingdom palaces such as those in Malkata and Amarna show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people birds water pools deities and geometric designs.143 Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of mudbricks. The architectural elements used in the worlds first largescale stone building Djosers mortuary complex include post and lintel supports in the papyrus and lotus motif.citation needed The earliest preserved ancient Egyptian temples such as those at Giza consist of single enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns. In the New Kingdom architects added the pylon the open courtyard and the enclosed hypostyle hall to the front of the temples sanctuary a style that was standard until the GrecoRoman period.144 The earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the Old Kingdom was the mastaba a flatroofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground burial chamber. The step pyramid of Djoser is a series of stone mastabas stacked on top of each other. Pyramids were built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms but most later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rockcut tombs.145 The use of the pyramid form continued in private tomb chapels of the New Kingdom and in the royal pyramids of Nubia.146 Model of a household porch and garden c.19811975 BC The Temple of Dendur completed by 10 BC Metropolitan Museum of Art New York City The well preserved Temple of Isis from Philae is an example of Egyptian architecture and architectural sculpture Illustration of various types of capitals by Karl Richard Lepsius Art Main articles Art of ancient Egypt and Portraiture in ancient Egypt Menna and Family Hunting in the Marshes Tomb of Menna c. 1400 BC The ancient Egyptians produced art to serve functional purposes. For over 3500 years artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were developed during the Old Kingdom following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change.147 These artistic standardssimple lines shapes and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depthcreated a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls coffins stelae and even statues. The Narmer Palette for example displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs.148 Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.149 Egyptian tomb models as funerary goods. Ancient Egyptian artisans used stone as a medium for carving statues and fine reliefs but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores red and yellow ochres copper ores blue and green soot or charcoal black and limestone white. Paints could be mixed with gum arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes which could be moistened with water when needed.150 Pharaohs used reliefs to record victories in battle royal decrees and religious scenes. Common citizens had access to pieces of funerary art such as shabti statues and books of the dead which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.151 During the Middle Kingdom wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife these models show laborers houses boats and even military formations that are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.152 Despite the homogeneity of ancient Egyptian art the styles of particular times and places sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After the invasion of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period Minoanstyle frescoes were found in Avaris.153 The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna Period where figures were radically altered to conform to Akhenatens revolutionary religious ideas.154 This style known as Amarna art was quickly abandoned after Akhenatens death and replaced by the traditional forms.155 Stelophorous statue of Amenemhat c.1500 BC Fresco which depicts Nebamun hunting birds c. 1350 BC Portrait head of pharaoh Hatshepsut or Thutmose III 14801425 BC Falcon box with wrapped contents 33230 BC Religious beliefs Main article Ancient Egyptian religion The Book of the Dead was a guide to the deceaseds journey in the afterlife. Beliefs in the divine and in the afterlife were ingrained in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception pharaonic rule was based on the divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However the gods were not always viewed as benevolent and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system.156 These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.157 The gods Osiris Anubis and Horus in the tomb of Horemheb KV57 in the Valley of the Kings. Gods were worshiped in cult temples administered by priests acting on the kings behalf. At the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally the gods domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos.158 After the New Kingdom the pharaohs role as a spiritual intermediary was deemphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result priests developed a system of oracles to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.159 The Egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or aspects. In addition to the body each person had a wt shadow a ba personality or soul a ka lifeforce and a name.160 The heart rather than the brain was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions. After death the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will but they required the physical remains or a substitute such as a statue as a permanent home. The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ka and ba and become one of the blessed dead living on as an akh or effective one. For this to happen the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial in which the heart was weighed against a feather of truth. If deemed worthy the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form.161 If they were not deemed worthy their heart was eaten by Ammit the Devourer and they were erased from the Universe.citation needed Burial customs Main article Ancient Egyptian funerary practices Anubis the god associated with mummification and burial rituals attending to a mummy. The ancient Egyptians maintained an elaborate set of burial customs that they believed were necessary to ensure immortality after death. These customs involved preserving the body by mummification performing burial ceremonies and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife.151 Before the Old Kingdom bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by desiccation. The arid desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification which involved removing the internal organs wrapping the body in linen and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty some parts were preserved separately in canopic jars.162 By the New Kingdom the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification the best technique took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs removing the brain through the nose and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called natron. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy which was decorated.163 Wealthy Egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items but all burials regardless of social status included goods for the deceased. Funerary texts were often included in the grave and beginning in the New Kingdom so were shabti statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife.164 Rituals in which the deceased was magically reanimated accompanied burials. After burial living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased.165 Military Main article Military of ancient Egypt Further information Ancient Egyptian navy Tutankhamun charging enemies on his chariot 
18 th dynasty. The ancient Egyptian military was responsible for defending Egypt against foreign invasion and for maintaining Egypts domination in the ancient Near East. The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods. The military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes such as those found at the city of Buhen on the way to Nubia. Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases such as the fortress at Sile which was a base of operations for expeditions to the Levant. In the New Kingdom a series of pharaohs used the standing Egyptian army to attack and conquer Kush and parts of the Levant.166 Wooden figures of soldiers from the tomb of nomarch Mesehti 
11 th dynasty Typical military equipment included bows and arrows spears and roundtopped shields made by stretching animal skin over a wooden frame. In the New Kingdom the military began using chariots that had earlier been introduced by the Hyksos invaders. Weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle spears were tipped with a bronze point and the khopesh was adopted from Asiatic soldiers.167 The pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army it has been suggested that at least a few pharaohs such as Seqenenre Tao II and his sons did do so.168 However it has also been argued that kings of this period did not personally act as frontline war leaders fighting alongside their troops.169 Soldiers were recruited from the general population but during and especially after the New Kingdom mercenaries from Nubia Kush and Libya were hired to fight for Egypt.170 Technology medicine and mathematics Technology Main article Ancient Egyptian technology Glassmaking was a highly developed art. In technology medicine and mathematics ancient Egypt achieved a relatively high standard of productivity and sophistication. Traditional empiricism as evidenced by the Edwin Smith and Ebers papyri c.1600 BC is first credited to Egypt. The Egyptians created their own alphabet and decimal system. Faience and glass Even before the Old Kingdom the ancient Egyptians had developed a glassy material known as faience which they treated as a type of artificial semiprecious stone. Faience is a nonclay ceramic made of silica small amounts of lime and soda and a colorant typically copper.171 The material was used to make beads tiles figurines and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core which was then fired. By a related technique the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian blue also called blue frit which is produced by fusing or sintering silica copper lime and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.172 The ancient Egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently.173 It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported premade ingots which they melted and finished. However they did have technical expertise in making objects as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced including yellow red green blue purple and white and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.174 Medicine Main article Ancient Egyptian medicine The medical problems of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stoneground flour abraded teeth leaving them susceptible to abscesses though caries were rare.175 The diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars which promoted periodontal disease.176 Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence.177 Adult life expectancy was about 35 for men and 30 for women but reaching adulthood was difficult as about onethird of the population died in infancy.e The Edwin Smith surgical papyrus describes anatomy and medical treatments written in hieratic c.1550 BC Ancient Egyptian physicians were renowned in the ancient Near East for their healing skills and some such as Imhotep remained famous long after their deaths.178 Herodotus remarked that there was a high degree of specialization among Egyptian physicians with some treating only the head or the stomach while others were eyedoctors and dentists.179 Training of physicians took place at the Per Ankh or House of Life institution most notably those headquartered in PerBastet during the New Kingdom and at Abydos and Sas in the Late period. Medical papyri show empirical knowledge of anatomy injuries and practical treatments.180 Wounds were treated by bandaging with raw meat white linen sutures nets pads and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection181 while opium thyme and belladona were used to relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers were made to the goddess Isis. Moldy bread honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns.182 Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds set broken bones and amputated diseased limbs but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.183 Maritime technology Early Egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull and had mastered advanced forms of shipbuilding as early as 3000 BC. The Archaeological Institute of America reports that the oldest planked ships known are the Abydos boats.5 A group of 14 discovered ships in Abydos were constructed of wooden planks sewn together. Discovered by Egyptologist David OConnor of New York University184 woven straps were found to have been used to lash the planks together5 and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams.5 Because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to Pharaoh Khasekhemwy originally they were all thought to have belonged to him but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000 BC and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating. The ship dating to 3000 BC was 75 feet 23 m long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh perhaps one as early as HorAha.184 Early Egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with treenails to fasten them together using pitch for caulking the seams. The Khufu ship a 
43.6 metre 143 ft vessel sealed into a pit in the Giza pyramid complex at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza in the Fourth Dynasty around 2500 BC is a fullsize surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a solar barque. Early Egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with mortise and tenon joints.5 Seagoing ship of an expedition to Punt from a relief of Hatshepsuts Mortuary temple Deir elBahari Large seagoing ships are known to have been heavily used by the Egyptians in their trade with the city states of the eastern Mediterranean especially Byblos on the coast of modernday Lebanon and in several expeditions down the Red Sea to the Land of Punt. In fact one of the earliest Egyptian words for a seagoing ship is a Byblos Ship which originally defined a class of Egyptian seagoing ships used on the Byblos run however by the end of the Old Kingdom the term had come to include large seagoing ships whatever their destination.185 In 1977 an ancient northsouth canal was discovered extending from Lake Timsah to the Ballah Lakes.186 It was dated to the Middle Kingdom of Egypt by extrapolating dates of ancient sites constructed along its course.1
86 f In 2011 archaeologists from Italy the United States and Egypt excavating a driedup lagoon known as Mersa Gawasis have unearthed traces of an ancient harbor that once launched early voyages like Hatshepsuts Punt expedition onto the open ocean. Some of the sites most evocative evidence for the ancient Egyptians seafaring prowess include large ship timbers and hundreds of feet of ropes made from papyrus coiled in huge bundles.187 In 2013 a team of FrancoEgyptian archaeologists discovered what is believed to be the worlds oldest port dating back about 4500 years from the time of King Khufu on the Red Sea coast near Wadi elJarf about 110 miles south of Suez.188 Mathematics Main article Ancient Egyptian mathematics Facsimile of the Astronomical chart in Senemuts tomb 
18 th dynasty189 The earliest attested examples of mathematical calculations date to the predynastic Naqada period and show a fully developed numeral system.g The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land labor and grain.190 Texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operationsaddition subtraction multiplication and divisionuse fractions calculate the areas of rectangles triangles and circles and compute the volumes of boxes columns and pyramids. They understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry and could solve simple sets of simultaneous equations.191 23 in hieroglyphs Mathematical notation was decimal and based on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number so to write the number eighty or eight hundred the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively.192 Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions. For example they resolved the fraction twofifths into the sum of onethird  onefifteenth. Standard tables of values facilitated this.193 Some common fractions however were written with a special glyphthe equivalent of the modern twothirds is shown on the right.194 Ancient Egyptian mathematicians knew the Pythagorean theorem as an empirical formula. They were aware for example that a triangle had a right angle opposite the hypotenuse when its sides were in a 345 ratio.195 They were able to estimate the area of a circle by subtracting oneninth from its diameter and squaring the result Area

11.5  million in the 
3 rd millennium BC to possibly 23 million by the 
1 st millennium BC before growing significantly towards the end of that millennium.197 The halls of Karnak Temple are built with rows of large columns. Archaeogenetics Main article Genetic history of Egypt According to historian William Stiebling and archaeologist Susan N. Helft conflicting DNA analysis on recent genetic samples such as the Amarna royal mummies has led to a lack of consensus on the genetic makeup of the ancient Egyptians and their geographic origins.198 The genetic history of Ancient Egypt remains a developing field and is relevant for the understanding of population demographic events connecting Africa and Eurasia. To date the amount of genomewide aDNA analyses on ancient specimens from Egypt and Sudan remain scarce although studies on uniparental haplogroups in ancient individuals have been carried out several times pointing broadly to affinities with other African and Eurasian groups.199200 The currently most advanced full genome analyses was made on three ancient specimens recovered from the Nile River Valley Abusir elMeleq Egypt. Two of the individuals were dated to the PrePtolemaic Period New Kingdom to Late Period and one individual to the Ptolemaic Period spanning around 1300 years of Egyptian history. These results point to a genetic continuity of Ancient Egyptians with modern Egyptians. The results further point to a close genetic affinity between ancient Egyptians and Middle Eastern populations especially ancient groups from the Levant Natufian culture.199200 The preserved Temple of Horus at Edfu is a model of Egyptian architecture. Ancient Egyptians also displayed affinities to Nubians to the south of Egypt in modernday Sudan. Archaeological and historical evidence support interactions between Egyptian and Nubian populations more than 5000 years ago with sociopolitical dynamics between Egyptians and Nubians ranging from peaceful coexistence to variably successful attempts of conquest. A study on sixtysix ancient Nubian individuals revealed significant contact with ancient Egyptians characterized by the presence of c. 57 NeolithicBronze Age Levantine ancestry in these individuals. Such geneflow of Levantinelike ancestry corresponds with archaeological and botanic evidence pointing to a Neolithic movement around 7000 years ago.199200 Genetic data on other Northern African specimens such as the c. 15000 year old Iberomaurusian Taforalt man but also specimens from the last Green Sahara and the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic point to the widespread presence of an Western Eurasian ancestry component distributed throughout Northern Africa the Sahara and the Horn of Africa having arrived via back migrations from the Middle East starting as early as c. 23000 years ago.201202203204 Modern Egyptians like modern Nubians underwent subsequent admixture events contributing both SubSaharan Africanlike and West Asianlike ancestries since the Roman period with significance on the African Slave Trade and the Spread of Islam.199200 Some scholars such as Christopher Ehret caution that a wider sampling area is needed and argue that the current data is inconclusive on the origin of ancient Egyptians. They also point out issues with the previously used methodology such as the sampling size comparative approach and a biased interpretation of the genetic data. They argue in favor for a link between Ancient Egypt and the northern Horn of Africa. This latter view has been attributed to the corresponding archaeological genetic linguistic and biological anthropological sources of evidence which broadly indicate that the earliest Egyptians and Nubians were the descendants of populations in northeast Africa.205206207198 Legacy See also Egyptian Revival architecture and Tourism in Egypt Frontispiece of Description de lgypte published in 38 volumes between 1809 and 1829. The culture and monuments of ancient Egypt have left a lasting legacy on the world. Egyptian civilization significantly influenced the Kingdom of Kush and Mero with both adopting Egyptian religious and architectural norms hundreds of pyramids 630 meters high were built in EgyptSudan as well as using Egyptian writing as the basis of the Meroitic script.208 Meroitic is the oldest written language in Africa other than Egyptian and was used from the 
2 nd century BC until the early 
5 th century AD.209 The cult of the goddess Isis for example became popular in the Roman Empire as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome.210 The Romans also imported building materials from Egypt to erect Egyptianstyle structures. Early historians such as Herodotus Strabo and Diodorus Siculus studied and wrote about the land which Romans came to view as a place of mystery.211 During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance Egyptian pagan culture was in decline after the rise of Christianity and later Islam but interest in Egyptian antiquity continued in the writings of medieval scholars such as DhulNun alMisri and alMaqrizi.212 In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys leading to a wave of Egyptomania across Europe as evident in symbolism like the Eye of Providence and the Great Seal of the United States. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt who took purchased or were given many important antiquities.213 Napoleon arranged the first studies in Egyptology when he brought some 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypts natural history which was published in the Description de lgypte.214 In the 
20 th century the Egyptian Government and archaeologists alike recognized the importance of cultural respect and integrity in excavations. Since the 20
10 s the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has overseen excavations and the recovery of artifacts.215 The Abu Haggag Mosque is integrated into the Luxor temple from the 
14 th century BC which has made it the oldest continuously used temple Cleopatra Testing Poisons on Condemned Prisoners 1887 by Alexandre Cabanel216 Tourists at the pyramid complex of Khafre near the Great Sphinx of Giza See also Ancient Egypt portal Civilizations portal Periods and dynasties of ancient Egypt All years are BC Early Predynastic period First Dynasty I c. 31502890 Second Dynasty II 28902686 Old Kingdom Third Dynasty III 26862613 Fourth Dynasty IV 26132498 Fifth Dynasty V 24982345 Sixth Dynasty VI 23452181 First Intermediate Seventh Dynasty VII spurious Eighth Dynasty VIII 21812160 Ninth Dynasty IX 21602130 Tenth Dynasty X 21302040 Early Eleventh Dynasty XI 21342061 Middle Kingdom Late Eleventh Dynasty XI 20611991 Twelfth Dynasty XII 19911803 Thirteenth Dynasty XIII 18031649 Second Intermediate Fourteenth Dynasty XIV 17051690 Fifteenth Dynasty Hyksos XV 16741535 Sixteenth Dynasty XVI 16601600 Abydos Dynasty 16501600 Seventeenth Dynasty XVII 15801549 New Kingdom Eighteenth Dynasty XVIII 15491292 Nineteenth Dynasty XIX 12921189 Twentieth Dynasty XX 11891077 Third Intermediate Twentyfirst Dynasty XXI 1069945 Twentysecond Dynasty XXII 945720 Twentythird Dynasty XXIII 837728 Twentyfourth Dynasty XXIV 732720 Twentyfifth Dynasty Nubian XXV 732653 Late Period Twentysixth Dynasty XXVI 672525 Twentyseventh Dynasty

Clayton 1994 p. 146  From Killebrew  Lehmann 2013 p. 2 First coined in 1881 by the French Egyptologist G. Maspero 1896 the somewhat misleading term Sea Peoples encompasses the ethnonyms Lukka Sherden Shekelesh Teresh Eqwesh Denyen Sikil  Tjekker Weshesh and Peleset Philistines. Footnote The modern term Sea Peoples refers to peoples that appear in several New Kingdom Egyptian texts as originating from islands... The use of quotation marks in association with the term Sea Peoples in our title is intended to draw attention to the problematic nature of this commonly used term. It is noteworthy that the designation of the sea appears only in relation to the Sherden Shekelesh and Eqwesh. Subsequently this term was applied somewhat indiscriminately to several additional ethnonyms including the Philistines who are portrayed in their earliest appearance as invaders from the north during the reigns of Merenptah and Ramesses III.  From Drews 1993 pp. 4861 The thesis that a great migration of the Sea Peoples occurred ca. 1200 B.C. is supposedly based on Egyptian inscriptions one from the reign of Merneptah and another from the reign of Ramesses III. Yet in the inscriptions themselves such a migration nowhere appears. After reviewing what the Egyptian texts have to say about the sea peoples one Egyptologist Wolfgang Helck recently remarked that although some things are unclear eins ist aber sicher Nach den agyptischen Texten haben wir es nicht mit einer Volkerwanderung zu tun. Thus the migration hypothesis is based not on the inscriptions themselves but on their interpretation.  Figures are given for adult life expectancy and do not reflect life expectancy at birth.
