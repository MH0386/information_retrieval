4 th century BC Languages Ancient Macedonian then Attic Greek and later Koine Greek Religion ancient Greek religion The Macedonians Greek  Makednes were an ancient tribe that lived on the alluvial plain around the rivers Haliacmon and lower Axios in the northeastern part of mainland Greece. Essentially an ancient Greek people1 they gradually expanded from their homeland along the Haliacmon valley on the northern edge of the Greek world absorbing or driving out neighbouring nonGreek tribes primarily Thracian and Illyrian.23 They spoke Ancient Macedonian which is usually classified by scholars as a dialect of Northwest Doric Greeknote 1 and occasionally as a distinct sister language of Greeknote 2 or an Aeolic Greek dialect.note 3 However the prestige language of the region during the Classical era was Attic Greek replaced by Koine Greek during the Hellenistic era.13 Their religious beliefs mirrored those of other Greeks following the main deities of the Greek pantheon although the Macedonians continued Archaic burial practices that had ceased in other parts of Greece after the 
6 th century BC. Aside from the monarchy the core of Macedonian society was its nobility. Similar to the aristocracy of neighboring Thessaly their wealth was largely built on herding horses and cattle. Although composed of various clans the kingdom of Macedonia established around the 
7 th century BC is mostly associated with the Argead dynasty and the tribe named after it. The dynasty was allegedly founded by Perdiccas I descendant of the legendary Temenus of Argos while the region of Macedon derived its name from Makedon a figure of Greek mythology. Traditionally ruled by independent families the Macedonians seem to have accepted Argead rule by the time of Alexander I r.498  454 BC. Under Philip II r.359  336 BC the Macedonians are credited with numerous military innovations which enlarged their territory and increased their control over other areas extending into Thrace. This consolidation of territory allowed for the exploits of Alexander the Great r.336  323 BC the conquest of the Achaemenid Empire the establishment of the diadochi successor states and the inauguration of the Hellenistic period in West Asia Greece and the broader Mediterranean world. The Macedonians were eventually conquered by the Roman Republic which dismantled the Macedonian monarchy at the end of the Third Macedonian War 171168 BC and established the Roman province of Macedonia after the Fourth Macedonian War 150148 BC. Authors historians and statesmen of the ancient world often expressed ambiguous if not conflicting ideas about the ethnic identity of the Macedonians as either Greeks semiGreeks or even barbarians. This has led to some debate among modern academics about the precise ethnic identity of the Macedonians who nevertheless embraced many aspects of contemporaneous Greek culture such as participation in Greek religious cults and athletic games including the exclusive Ancient Olympic Games. Given the scant linguistic evidence such as the Pella curse tablet ancient Macedonian is regarded by most scholars as another Greek dialect possibly related to Doric Greek or Northwestern Greek.a The ancient Macedonians participated in the production and fostering of Classical and later Hellenistic art. In terms of visual arts they produced frescoes mosaics sculptures and decorative metalwork. The performing arts of music and Greek theatrical dramas were highly appreciated while famous playwrights such as Euripides came to live in Macedonia. The kingdom also attracted the presence of renowned philosophers such as Aristotle while native Macedonians contributed to the field of ancient Greek literature especially Greek historiography. Their sport and leisure activities included hunting foot races and chariot races as well as feasting and drinking at aristocratic banquets known as symposia. Etymology The ethnonym  Makednes stems from the Ancient Greek adjective  makedns meaning tall slim also the name of a people related to the Dorians Herodotus.25 It is most likely cognate with the adjective  makrs meaning long or tall in Ancient Greek.25 The name is believed to have originally meant either highlanders the tall ones or high grown men.note 4 Origins consolidation and expansion Further information History of Macedonia ancient kingdom and Demographic history of Macedonia Historical overview Further information Argead dynasty Antipatrid dynasty and Antigonid dynasty The expansion of ancient Macedon up to the death of Philip II of Macedon r.359  336 BC The expansion of the Macedonian kingdom has been described as a threestage process. As a frontier kingdom on the border of the Greek world with barbarian Europe the Macedonians first subjugated their immediate northern neighbours  various Paeonian Illyrian and Thracian tribes  before turning against the states of southern and central Greece. Macedonia then led a panHellenic military force against their primary objectivethe conquest of Persiawhich they achieved with remarkable ease.26272829 Following the death of Alexander the Great and the Partition of Babylon in 323 BC the diadochi successor states such as the Attalid Ptolemaic and Seleucid Empires were established ushering in the Hellenistic period of Greece West Asia and the Hellenized Mediterranean Basin.30 With Alexanders conquest of the Achaemenid Empire Macedonians colonized territories as far east as Central Asia.31 The Macedonians continued to rule much of Hellenistic Greece 323146 BC forming alliances with Greek leagues such as the Cretan League and Epirote League and prior to this the Kingdom of Epirus.32 However they often fell into conflict with the Achaean League Aetolian League the citystate of Sparta and the Ptolemaic dynasty of Hellenistic Egypt that intervened in wars of the Aegean region and mainland Greece.33 After Macedonia formed an alliance with Hannibal of Ancient Carthage in 215 BC the rival Roman Republic responded by fighting a series of wars against Macedonia in conjunction with its Greek allies such as Pergamon and Rhodes.34 In the aftermath of the Third Macedonian War 171168 BC the Romans abolished the Macedonian monarchy under Perseus of Macedon r.179168 BC  and replaced the kingdom with four client state republics.35 A brief revival of the monarchy by the pretender Andriscus led to the Fourth Macedonian War 150148 BC after which Rome established the Roman province of Macedonia and subjugated the Macedonians.36 Prehistoric homeland The positions of the Balkan tribes prior to the Macedonian expansion according to Nicholas Hammond In Greek mythology Makedon is the eponymous hero of Macedonia and is mentioned in Hesiods Catalogue of Women.37 The first historical attestation of the Macedonians occurs in the works of Herodotus during the mid
5 th century BC.38 The Macedonians are absent in Homers Catalogue of Ships and the term Macedonia itself appears late. The Iliad states that upon leaving Mount Olympus Hera journeyed via Pieria and Emathia before reaching Athos.39 This is reiterated by Strabo in his Geography.40 Nevertheless archaeological evidence indicates that Mycenaean contact with or penetration into the Macedonian interior possibly started from the early 
14 th century BC.4142 In his A History of Macedonia Nicholas Hammond reconstructed the earliest phases of Macedonian history based on his interpretation of later literary accounts and archaeological excavations in the region of Macedonia.43 According to Hammond the Macedonians are missing from early Macedonian historical accounts because they had been living in the Orestian highlands since before the Greek Dark Ages possibly having originated from the same protoGreek population pool that produced other Greek peoples.4445 The Macedonian tribes subsequently moved down from Orestis in the upper Haliacmon to the Pierian highlands in the lower Haliacmon because of pressure from the Molossians a related tribe who had migrated to Orestis from Pelagonia.46 In their new Pierian home north of Olympus the Macedonian tribes mingled with the protoDorians. This might account for traditions which placed the eponymous founder Makedon near Pieria and Olympus.47 Some traditions placed the Dorian homeland in the Pindus mountain range in western Thessaly whilst Herodotus pushed this further north to the Macedonian Pindus and claimed that the Greeks were referred to as Makednon M and then as Dorians.4849 A different southern homeland theory also exists in traditional historiography. Arnold J. Toynbee asserted that the Makedones migrated north to Macedonia from central Greece placing the Dorian homeland in Phthiotis and citing the traditions of fraternity between Makedon and Magnes.50 Temenids and Argeads The Macedonian expansion is said to have been led by the ruling Temenid dynasty known as Argeads or Argives. Herodotus said that Perdiccas the dynastys founder was descended from the Heraclid Temenus.51 He left Argos with his two older brothers Aeropus and Gayanes and travelled via Illyria to Lebaea a city in Upper Macedonia which certain scholars have tried to connect with the villages Albus or Velventos.52 Here the brothers served as shepherds for a local ruler. After a vision the brothers fled to another region in Macedonia near the Midas Gardens by the foot of the Vermio Mountains and then set about subjugating the rest of Macedonia.53 Thucydidess account is similar to that of Herodotus making it probable that the story was disseminated by the Macedonian court54 i.e. it accounts for the belief the Macedonians had about the origin of their kingdom if not an actual memory of this beginning.55 Later historians modified the dynastic traditions by introducing variously Caranus565758 or Archelaus the son of Temenus as the founding Temenid kingsalthough there is no doubt that Euripides transformed Caranus to Archelaus meaning leader of the people in his play Archelaus in an attempt to please Archelaus I of Macedon.59 The route of the Argeads from Argos Peloponnese to Macedonia The earliest sources Herodotus and Thucydides called the royal family Temenidae. In later sources Strabo Appian Pausanias the term Argeadae was introduced. However Appian said that the term Argeadae referred to a leading Macedonian tribe rather than the name of the ruling dynasty.6061 The connection of the Argead name to the royal family is uncertain. The words Argead and Argive derive via Latin Argvus62 from Ancient Greek  Argeios meaning of or from Argos6364 and is first attested in Homer where it was also used as a collective designation for the Greeks   Argive Danaans.65 The most common connection to the royal family as written by Herodotus is with Peloponnesian Argos.66 Appian connects it with Orestian Argos.60 According to another tradition mentioned by Justin the name was adopted after Caranus moved Macedonias capital from Edessa to Aegae thus appropriating the name of the city for its citizens.67 A figure Argeas is mentioned in the Iliad

17.6 1 Taking Herodotuss lineage account as the most trustworthy Appian said that after Perdiccas six successive heirs ruled Argeus Philip Aeropus Alcetas Amyntas and Alexander.68 Amyntas I r.547  498 BC ruled at the time of the Persian invasion of Paeonia and when Macedon became a vassal state of Achaemenid Persia.6970 However Alexander I r.498  454 BC is the first truly historic figure. Based on this line of succession and an estimated average rule of 25 to 30 years the beginnings of the Macedonian dynasty have thus been traditionally dated to 750 BC.6171 Hammond supports the traditional view that the Temenidae did arrive from the Peloponnese and took charge of Macedonian leadership possibly usurping rule from a native Argead dynasty with Illyrian help.53 However other scholars doubt the veracity of their Peloponnesian origins. For example Miltiades Hatzopoulos takes Appians testimony to mean that the royal lineage imposed itself onto the tribes of the Middle Heliacmon from Argos Orestikon52 whilst Eugene N. Borza argues that the Argeads were a family of notables hailing from Vergina.72 Expansion from the core Further information Rise of Macedon and Colonies in antiquity Expulsion of the Pieres from the region of Olympus to the Pangaion Hills by the Macedonians Both Strabo and Thucydides said that Emathia and Pieria were mostly occupied by Thracians Pieres Paeonians and Bottiaeans as well as some Illyrian and Epirote tribes.73 Herodotus states that the Bryges were cohabitants with the Macedonians before their mass migration to Anatolia.74 If a group of ethnically definable Macedonian tribes were living in the Pierian highlands prior to their expansion the first conquest was of the Pierian piedmont and coastal plain including Vergina.75 The tribes may have launched their expansion from a base near Mount Bermion according to Herodotus.76 Thucydides describes the Macedonian expansion specifically as a process of conquest led by the Argeads77 But the country along the sea which is now called Macedonia was first acquired and made a kingdom by Alexander I father of Perdiccas II and his forefathers who were originally Temenidae from Argos. They defeated and expelled from Pieria the Pierians ... and also expelled the Bottiaeans from Bottiaea ... they acquired as well a narrow strip of Paeonia extending along the Axios river from the interior to Pella and the sea. Beyond the Axios they possess the territory as far as the Strymon called Mygdonia having driven out the Edoni. Moreover they expelled from the district now called Eordaea the Eordi ... The Macedonians also made themselves rulers of certain places ... namely Anthemus Grestonia and a large part of Macedonia proper.77 Regions of Mygdonia Edonia Bisaltia Crestonia and Bottiaea Thucydidess account gives a geographical overview of Macedonian possessions at the time of Alexander Is rule. To reconstruct a chronology of the expansion by Alexander Is predecessors is more difficult but generally three stages have been proposed from Thucydides reading. The initial and most important conquest was of Pieria and Bottiaea including the locations of Pydna and Dium. The second stage consolidated rule in Pieria and Bottiaea captured Methone and Pella and extended rule over Eordaea and Almopia. According to Hammond the third stage occurred after 550 BC when the Macedonians gained control over Mygdonia Edonis lower Paeonia Bisaltia and Crestonia.78 However the second stage might have occurred as late as 520 BC79 and the third stage probably did not occur until after 479 BC when the Macedonians capitalized on the weakened Paeonian state after the Persian withdrawal from Macedon and the rest of their mainland European territories.80 Whatever the case Thucydides account of the Macedonian state describes its accumulated territorial extent by the rule of Perdiccas II Alexander Is son. Hammond has said that the early stages of Macedonian expansion were militaristic subduing or expunging populations from a large and varied area.81 Pastoralism and highland living could not support a very concentrated settlement density forcing pastoralist tribes to search for more arable lowlands suitable for agriculture.82 Ethnogenesis scenario The entrance to the Great Tumulus Museum at Vergina Presentday scholars have highlighted several inconsistencies in the traditionalist perspective first set in place by Hammond.83 An alternative model of state and ethnos formation promulgated by an alliance of regional elites which redates the creation of the Macedonian kingdom to the 
6 th century BC was proposed in 20
10.8 4 According to these scholars direct literary archaeological and linguistic evidence to support Hammonds contention that a distinct Macedonian ethnos had existed in the Haliacmon valley since the Aegean civilizations is lacking. Hammonds interpretation has been criticized as a conjectural reconstruction from what appears during later historical times.85 Similarly the historicity of migration conquest and population expulsion have also been questioned. Thucydidess account of the forced expulsion of the Pierians and Bottiaeans could have been formed on the basis of his perceived similarity of names of the Pierians and Bottiaeans living in the Struma valley with the names of regions in Macedonia whereas his account of Eordean extermination was formulated because such toponymic correspondences are absent.80 Likewise the Argead conquest of Macedonia may be viewed as a commonly used literary topos in classical Macedonian rhetoric. Tales of migration served to create complex genealogical connections between transregional ruling elites while at the same time were used by the ruling dynasty to legitimize their rule heroicize mythical ancestors and distance themselves from their subjects.5586 Conflict was a historical reality in the early Macedonian kingdom and pastoralist traditions allowed the potential for population mobility. Greek archaeologists have found that some of the passes linking the Macedonian highlands with the valley regions have been used for thousands of years. However the archaeological evidence does not point to any significant disruptions between the Iron Age and Hellenistic period in Macedonia. The general continuity of material culture87 settlement sites88 and preGreek onomasticon contradict the alleged ethnic cleansing account of early Macedonian expansion.89 An atrium with a pebblemosaic paving in Pella the Macedonian capital The process of state formation in Macedonia was similar to that of its neighbours in Epirus Illyria Thrace and Thessaly whereby regional elites could mobilize disparate communities for the purpose of organizing land and resources. Local notables were often based in urbanlike settlements although contemporaneous historians often did not recognize them as poleis because they were not selfruled but under the rule of a king.90 From the mid
6 th century there appears a series of exceptionally rich burials throughout the regionin Trebenita Vergina Sindos Agia Paraskevi PellaArchontiko Aiani Gevgelija Amphipolissharing a similar burial rite and grave accompaniments interpreted to represent the rise of a new regional ruling class sharing a common ideology customs and religious beliefs.84 A common geography mode of existence and defensive interests might have necessitated the creation of a political confederacy among otherwise ethnolinguistically diverse communities which led to the consolidation of a new Macedonian ethnic identity.8491 The traditional view that Macedonia was populated by rural ethnic groups in constant conflict is slowly changing bridging the cultural gap between southern Epirus and the north Aegean region. Hatzopouloss studies on Macedonian institutions have lent support to the hypothesis that Macedonian state formation occurred via an integration of regional elites which were based in citylike centres including the Argeadae at Vergina the PaeonianEdonian peoples in Sindos Ichnae and Pella and the mixed MacedonianBarbarian colonies in the Thermaic Gulf and western Chalkidiki.92 The Temenidae became overall leaders of a new Macedonian state because of the diplomatic proficiency of Alexander I and the logistic centrality of Vergina itself. It has been suggested that a breakdown in traditional Balkan tribal traditions associated with adaptation of Aegean sociopolitical institutions created a climate of institutional flexibility in a vast resourcerich land.93 NonArgead centres increasingly became dependent allies allowing the Argeads to gradually assert and secure their control over the lower and eastern territories of Macedonia.92 This control was fully consolidated by Phillip II r.359  336 BC.94 Culture and society Further information Culture of Greece The Golden Larnax at the Museum of Vergina which contains the remains Philip II of Macedon r.359  336 BC Macedonia had a distinct material culture by the Early Iron Age.95 Typically Balkan burial ornamental and ceramic forms were used for most of the Iron Age.95 These features suggest broad cultural affinities and organizational structures analogous with Thracian Epirote and Illyrian regions.9697 This did not necessarily symbolize a shared cultural identity or any political allegiance between these regions.98 In the late sixth century BC Macedonia became open to south Greek influences although a small but detectable amount of interaction with the south had been present since late Mycenaean times.99 By the 
5 th century BC Macedonia was a part of the Greek cultural milieu according to Edward M. Anson possessing many cultural traits typical of the southern Greek citystates.100 Classical Greek objects and customs were appropriated selectively and used in peculiarly Macedonian ways.101 In addition influences from Achaemenid Persia in culture and economy are evident from the 
5 th century BC onward such as the inclusion of Persian grave goods at Macedonian burial sites as well as the adoption of royal customs such as a Persianstyle throne during the reign of Philip II.102 Economy society and social class Main articles Economy of ancient Greece and Government of Macedonia ancient kingdom Further information Slavery in ancient Greece Prostitution in ancient Greece and Pederasty in ancient Greece Macedonian coins and medallions depicting Alexander the Great and Philip II The way of life of the inhabitants of Upper Macedonia differed little from that of their neighbours in Epirus and Illyria engaging in seasonal transhumance supplemented by agriculture. Young Macedonian men were typically expected to engage in hunting and martial combat as a byproduct of their transhumance lifestyles of herding livestock such as goats and sheep while horse breeding and raising cattle were other common pursuits.103 In these mountainous regions upland sites were important focal points for local communities. In these difficult terrains competition for resources often precipitated intertribal conflict and raiding forays into the comparatively richer lowland settlements of coastal Macedonia and Thessaly.104 Despite the remoteness of the upper Macedonian highlands excavations at Aiani since 1983 have discovered finds attesting to the presence of social organization since the 
2 nd millennium BC. The finds include the oldest pieces of blackandwhite pottery which is characteristic of the tribes of northwest Greece discovered so far.105 Found with ycenaean sherds they can be dated with certainty to the 
14 th century BC.105106107 The finds also include some of the oldest samples of writing in Macedonia among them inscriptions bearing Greek names like  Themida. The inscriptions demonstrate that Hellenism in Upper Macedonia was at a high economic artistic and cultural level by the sixth century BCoverturning the notion that Upper Macedonia was culturally and socially isolated from the rest of ancient Greece.105 By contrast the alluvial plains of Lower Macedonia and Pelagonia which had a comparative abundance of natural resources such as timber and minerals favored the development of a native aristocracy with a wealth that at times surpassed the classical Greek poleis.108 Exploitation of minerals helped expedite the introduction of coinage in Macedonia from the 
5 th century BC developing under southern Greek Thracian and Persian influences.109 Some Macedonians engaged in farming often with irrigation land reclamation and horticulture activities supported by the Macedonian state.110 However the bedrock of the Macedonian economy and state finances was the twofold exploitation of the forests with logging and valuable minerals such as copper iron gold and silver with mining.111 The conversion of these raw materials into finished products and their sale encouraged the growth of urban centers and a gradual shift away from the traditional rustic Macedonian lifestyle during the course of the 
5 th century BC.112 Entrance to the tomb of Philip II of Macedon r.359  336 BC. Macedonian society was dominated by aristocratic families whose main source of wealth and prestige was their herds of horses and cattle. In this respect Macedonia was similar to Thessaly and Thrace.97 These aristocrats were second only to the king in terms of power and privilege filling the ranks of his administration and serving as commanding officers in the military.113 It was in the more bureaucratic regimes of the Hellenistic kingdoms succeeding Alexander the Greats empire where greater social mobility for members of society seeking to join the aristocracy could be found especially in Ptolemaic Egypt.114 In contrast with classical Greek poleis the Macedonians held only few slaves.115116 Aristotle a philosopher from the Macedonian town of Stageira tutoring young Alexander in the Royal Palace of Pella. The Macedonian Kings often sought the best education possible for their heirs. Artwork by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris. However unlike Thessaly Macedonia was ruled by a monarchy from its earliest history until the Roman conquest in 167 BC. The nature of the kingship however remains debated. One viewpoint sees it as an autocracy whereby the king held absolute power and was at the head of both government and society wielding arguably unlimited authority to handle affairs of state and public policy. He was also the leader of a very personal regime with close relationships or connections to his hetairoi the core of the Macedonian aristocracy.117 Any other position of authority including the army was appointed at the whim of the king himself. The other constitutionalist position argues that there was an evolution from a society of many minor kings  each of equal authority  to a sovereign military state whereby an army of citizen soldiers supported a central king against a rival class of nobility.118 Kingship was hereditary along the paternal line yet it is unclear if primogeniture was strictly observed as an established custom.119 During the Late Bronze Age circa 
15 thcentury BC the ancient Macedonians developed distinct mattpainted wares that evolved from Middle Helladic pottery traditions originating in central and southern Greece.107120 The Macedonians continued to use an individualized form of material culturealbeit showing analogies in ceramic ornamental and burial forms with the socalled Lausitz culture between 1200 and 900 BCand that of the Glasinac culture after circa 900 BC.121 While some of these influences persisted beyond the sixth century BC87122 a more ubiquitous presence of items of an AegeanMediterranean character is seen from the latter sixth century BC123 as Greece recovered from its Dark Ages. Southern Greek impulses penetrated Macedonia via trade with north Aegean colonies such as Methone and those in the Chalcidice neighbouring Thessaly and from the Ionic colonies of Asia Minor. Ionic influences were later supplanted by those of Athenian provenance. Thus by the latter sixth century local elites could acquire exotic Aegean items such as Athenian red figure pottery fine tablewares olive oil and wine amphorae fine ceramic perfume flasks glass marble and precious metal ornamentsall of which would serve as status symbols.124 By the 
5 th century BC these items became widespread in Macedonia and in much of the central Balkans.125 Macedonian settlements have a strong continuity dating from the Bronze Age maintaining traditional construction techniques for residential architecture. While settlement numbers appeared to drop in central and southern Greece after 1000 BC there was a dramatic increase of settlements in Macedonia.126 These settlements seemed to have developed along raised promontories near river flood plains called tells Greek . Their ruins are most commonly found in western Macedonia between Florina and Lake Vergoritis the upper and middle Haliacmon River and Bottiaea. They can also be found on either side of the Axios and in the Chalcidice in eastern Macedonia.127 Religion and funerary practices Further information Ancient Greek religion Greek mythology Hellenistic religion Ancient Greek temple Greek hero cult GrecoRoman mysteries Oracle of Delphi Lion of Amphipolis Lion of Chaeronea and Pella curse tablet Ancient Dion was a centre of the worship of Zeus and the most important spiritual sanctuary of the ancient Macedonians. The Lion of Amphipolis in Amphipolis northern Greece a 
4 thcentury BC marble tomb sculpture128 erected in honor of Laomedon of Mytilene a general who served under Alexander the Great By the 
5 th century BC the Macedonians and the rest of the Greeks worshiped more or less the same deities of the Greek pantheon.129 In Macedonia politics and religion often intertwined. For instance the head of state for the city of Amphipolis also served as the priest of Asklepios Greek god of medicine a similar arrangement existed at Cassandreia where a cult priest honoring the citys founder Cassander was the nominal municipal leader.130 Foreign cults from Egypt were fostered by the royal court such as the temple of Sarapis at Thessaloniki while Macedonian kings Philip III of Macedon and Alexander IV of Macedon made votive offerings to the internationally esteemed Samothrace temple complex of the Cabeiri mystery cult.131 This was also the same location where Perseus of Macedon fled and received sanctuary following his defeat by the Romans at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC.132 The main sanctuary of Zeus was maintained at Dion while another at Veria was dedicated to Herakles and received particularly strong patronage from Demetrius II Aetolicus r.239  229 BC when he intervened in the affairs of the municipal government at the behest of the cults main priest.131 The ancient Macedonians worshipped the Twelve Olympians especially Zeus Artemis Heracles and Dionysus. Evidence of this worship exists from the beginning of the 
4 th century BC onwards but little evidence of Macedonian religious practices from earlier times exists.133 From an early period Zeus was the single most important deity in the Macedonian pantheon.133 Makedon the mythical ancestor of the Macedonians was held to be a son of Zeus and Zeus features prominently in Macedonian coinage.133 The most important centre of worship of Zeus was at Dion in Pieria the spiritual centre of the Macedonians where beginning in 400 BC King Archelaus established an annual festival which in honour of Zeus featured lavish sacrifices and athletic contests.133 Worship of Zeuss son Heracles was also prominent coins featuring Heracles appear from the 
5 th century BC onwards.133 This was in large part because the Argead kings of Macedon traced their lineage to Heracles making sacrifices to him in the Macedonian capitals of Vergina and Pella.133 Numerous votive reliefs and dedications also attest to the importance of the worship of Artemis.134 Artemis was often depicted as a huntress and served as a tutelary goddess for young girls entering the comingofage process much as Heracles Kynagidas Hunter did for young men who had completed it.134 By contrast some deities popular elsewhere in the Greek worldnotably Poseidon and Hephaestuswere largely ignored by the Macedonians.133 Other deities worshipped by the ancient Macedonians were part of a local pantheon which included Thaulos god of war equated with Ares Gyga later equated with Athena Gozoria goddess of hunting equated with Artemis Zeirene goddess of love equated with Aphrodite and Xandos god of light.135 A notable influence on Macedonian religious life and worship was neighbouring Thessaly the two regions shared many similar cultural institutions.136 They were tolerant of and open to incorporating foreign religious influences such as the sun worship of the Paeonians.3 By the 
4 th century BC there had been a significant fusion of Macedonian and common Greek religious identity137 but Macedonia was nevertheless characterized by an unusually diverse religious life.3 This diversity extended to the belief in magic as evidenced by curse tablets. It was a significant but secret aspect of Greek cultural practice.138 Hades abducting Persephone fresco in the small Macedonian royal tomb at Vergina Macedonia Greece c. 340 BC A notable feature of Macedonian culture was the ostentatious burials reserved for its rulers.139 The Macedonian elite built lavish tombs at the time of death rather than constructing temples during life.139 Such traditions had been practiced throughout Greece and the centralwest Balkans since the Bronze Age. Macedonian burials contain items similar to those at Mycenae such as burial with weapons gold death masks etc.101 From the sixth century Macedonian burials became particularly lavish displaying a rich variety of Greek imports reflecting the incorporation of Macedonia into a wider economic and political network centred on the Aegean citystates. Burials contained jewellery and ornaments of unprecedented wealth and artistic style. This zenith of Macedonian warrior burial style closely parallels those of sites in southcentral Illyria and western Thrace creating a koinon of elite burials.140 Lavish warrior burials had been discontinued in southern and central Greece from the seventh century onwards where offerings at sanctuaries and the erection of temples became the norm.141 From the sixth century BC cremation replaced the traditional inhumation rite for elite Macedonians.84 One of the most lavish tombs dating from the 
4 th century BC believed to be that of Phillip II is at Vergina. It contains extravagant grave goods highly sophisticated artwork depicting hunting scenes and Greek cultic figures and a vast array of weaponry.142 This demonstrates a continuing tradition of the warrior society rather than a focus on religious piety and technology of the intellect which had become paramount facets of central Greek society in the Classical Period.141 In the three royal tombs at Vergina professional painters decorated the walls with a mythological scene of Hades abducting Persephone Tomb 1 and royal hunting scenes Tomb 2 while lavish grave goods including weapons armor drinking vessels and personal items were housed with the dead whose bones were burned before burial in decorated gold coffins.143 Some grave goods and decorations were common in other Macedonian tombs yet some items found at Vergina were distinctly tied to royalty including a diadem luxurious goods and arms and armor.144 Scholars have debated about the identity of the tomb occupants since the discovery of their remains in 19771978145 yet recent research and forensic examination have concluded with certainty that at least one of the persons buried was Philip II Tomb 
2.1 46 Located near Tomb 1 are the aboveground ruins of a heroon a shrine for cult worship of the dead.147 In 2014 the ancient Macedonian Kasta Tomb the largest ancient tomb found in Greece as of 2017 was discovered outside of Amphipolis a city that was incorporated into the Macedonian realm after its capture by Philip II in 357 BC.148149150 The identity of the tombs occupant is unknown but archaeologists have speculated that it may be Alexanders close friend Hephaestion.151 The deification of Macedonian monarchs perhaps began with the death of Philip II yet it was his son Alexander the Great who unambiguously claimed to be a living god.152 As pharaoh of the Egyptians he was already entitled as Son of Ra and considered the living incarnation of Horus by his Egyptian subjects a belief that the Ptolemaic successors of Alexander would foster for their own dynasty in Egypt.153 However following his visit to the oracle of Didyma in 334 BC that suggested his divinity he traveled to the Oracle of Zeus Ammon the Greek equivalent of the Egyptian AmunRa at the Siwa Oasis of the Libyan Desert in 332 BC to confirm his divine status.154 After the priest there convinced him that Philip II was merely his mortal father and Zeus his actual father Alexander began styling himself as the Son of Zeus which brought him into contention with some of his Greek subjects who adamantly believed that living men could not be immortals.155 Although the Seleucid and Ptolemaic diadochi successor states cultivated their own ancestral cults and deification of the rulers as part of state ideology a similar cult did not exist in the Kingdom of Macedonia.156 Visual arts Main article Ancient Greek art Further information Hellenistic art Music in ancient Greece Pottery of ancient Greece and Ancient Greek sculpture Left Fresco of a Macedonian soldier resting a spear and wearing a cap from the tomb of Agios Athanasios Thessaloniki

4 th century BC By the reign of Archelaus I of Macedon the Macedonian elite started importing significantly greater customs artwork and art traditions from other regions of Greece. However they still retained more archaic perhaps Homeric funerary rites connected with the symposium and drinking rites that were typified with items such as decorative metal kraters that held the ashes of deceased Macedonian nobility in their tombs.157 Among these is the large bronze Derveni Krater from a

6 th century BC onward with drinking vessels jewellery containers crowns diadems and coins among the many metal objects found in Macedonian tombs.159 Surviving Macedonian painted artwork includes frescoes and murals on walls but also decoration on sculpted artwork such as statues and reliefs. For instance trace colors still exist on the basreliefs of the Alexander Sarcophagus.160 Macedonian paintings have allowed historians to investigate the clothing fashions as well as military gear worn by ancient Macedonians such as the brightlycolored tomb paintings of Agios Athanasios Thessaloniki showing figures wearing headgear ranging from feathered helmets to kausia and petasos caps.161 Alexander left wearing a kausia and fighting an Asiatic lion with his friend Craterus late 
4 th century BC mosaic162 Archaeological Museum of Pella Macedonia Aside from metalwork and painting mosaics serve as another significant form of surviving Macedonian artwork especially those discovered at Pella dating to the 
4 th century BC.159 The Stag Hunt Mosaic of Pella with its three dimensional qualities and illusionist style show clear influence from painted artwork and wider Hellenistic art trends although the rustic theme of hunting was tailored for Macedonian tastes.163 The similar Lion Hunt Mosaic of Pella illustrates either a scene of Alexander the Great with his companion Craterus or simply a conventional illustration of the generic royal diversion of hunting.163 Mosaics with mythological themes include scenes of Dionysus riding a panther and Helen of Troy being abducted by Theseus the latter of which employs illusionist qualities and realistic shading similar to Macedonian paintings.163 Common themes of Macedonian paintings and mosaics include warfare hunting and aggressive masculine sexuality i.e. abduction of women for rape or marriage. In some instances these themes are combined within the same work indicating a metaphorical connection that seems to be affirmed by later Byzantine Greek literature.164 Theatre music and performing arts Further information Theatre in ancient Greece and Music in ancient Greece Philip II was assassinated by his bodyguard Pausanias of Orestis in 336 BC at the theatre of Aigai Macedonia amid games and spectacles held inside that celebrated the marriage of his daughter Cleopatra of Macedon.165 Alexander the Great was allegedly a great admirer of both theatre and music.166 He was especially fond of the plays by Classical Athenian tragedians Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides whose works formed part of a proper Greek education for his new eastern subjects alongside studies in the Greek language and epics of Homer.167 While he and his army were stationed at Tyre in modernday Lebanon Alexander had his generals act as judges not only for athletic contests but also stage performances of Greek tragedies.168 The contemporaneous famous actors Thessalus and Athenodorus performed at the event despite Athenodorus risking a fine for being absent from the simultaneous Dionysia festival of Athens where he was scheduled to perform a fine that his patron Alexander agreed to pay.169 Music was also appreciated in Macedonia. In addition to the agora the gymnasium the theatre and religious sanctuaries and temples dedicated to Greek gods and goddesses one of the main markers of a true Greek city in the empire of Alexander the Great was the presence of an odeon for musical performances.170 This was the case not only for Alexandria in Egypt but also cities as distant as AiKhanoum in what is now modernday Afghanistan.170 Literature education philosophy and patronage Further information Literature in ancient Greece Education in ancient Greece Philosophy in ancient Greece Ancient Greek medicine and Ancient Macedonian calendar Portrait bust of Aristotle an Imperial Roman

Perdiccas II of Macedon was able to host wellknown Classical Greek intellectual visitors at his royal court such as the lyric poet Melanippides and the renowned medical doctor Hippocrates while Pindars enkomion written for Alexander I of Macedon may have been composed at his court.171 Yet Archelaus I of Macedon received a far greater number of Greek scholars artists and celebrities at his court than his predecessors leading M. B. Hatzopoulos to describe Macedonia under his reign as an active centre of Hellenic culture.172 His honored guests included the painter Zeuxis the architect Callimachus the poets Choerilus of Samos Timotheus of Miletus and Agathon as well as the famous Athenian playwright Euripides.173 Although Archelaus was criticized by the philosopher Plato supposedly hated by Socrates and the first known Macedonian king to be insulted with the label of a barbarian the historian Thucydides held the Macedonian king in glowing admiration for his accomplishments including his engagement in panhellenic sports and fostering of literary culture.174 The philosopher Aristotle who studied at the Platonic Academy of Athens and established the Aristotelian school of thought moved to Macedonia and is said to have tutored the young Alexander the Great in addition to serving as an esteemed diplomat for Alexanders father Philip II.175 Among Alexanders retinue of artists writers and philosophers was Pyrrho of Elis founder of Pyrrhonism the school of philosophical skepticism.167 During the Antigonid period Antigonos Gonatas fostered cordial relationships with Menedemos of Eretria founder of the Eretrian school of philosophy and Zenon the founder of Stoicism.166 In terms of early Greek historiography and later Roman historiography Felix Jacoby identified thirteen possible ancient historians who wrote histories about Macedonia in his Fragmente der griechischen Historiker.176 Aside from accounts in the works of Herodotus and Thucydides the works compiled by Jacoby are only fragmentary whereas other works are completely lost such as the history of an Illyrian war fought by Perdiccas III of Macedon written by the Macedonian general and statesman Antipater.177 The Macedonian historians Marsyas of Pella and Marsyas of Philippi wrote histories of Macedonia while the Ptolemaic king Ptolemy I Soter authored a history about Alexander and Hieronymus of Cardia wrote a history about Alexanders royal successors.178 Following the Indian campaign of Alexander the Great the Macedonian military officer Nearchus wrote a work of his voyage from the mouth of the Indus river to the Persian Gulf.179 The Macedonian historian Craterus published a compilation of decrees made by the popular assembly of the Athenian democracy ostensibly while attending the school of Aristotle.179 Philip V of Macedon had manuscripts of the history of Philip II written by Theopompus gathered by his court scholars and disseminated with further copies.166 Sports and leisure Further information History of sport  Ancient Greece Gymnasium ancient Greece Ancient Olympic Games and Music in ancient Greece A fresco showing Hades and Persephone riding in a chariot from the tomb of Queen Eurydice I of Macedon at Vergina Greece 
4 th century BC When Alexander I of Macedon petitioned to compete in the foot race of the ancient Olympic Games the event organizers at first denied his request explaining that only Greeks were allowed to compete. However Alexander I produced proof of an Argead royal genealogy showing ancient Argive Temenid lineage a move that ultimately convinced the Olympic Hellanodikai authorities of his Greek descent and ability to compete although this did not necessarily apply to common Macedonians outside of his royal dynasty.180 By the end of the 
5 th century BC the Macedonian king Archelaus I was crowned with the olive wreath at both Olympia and Delphi in the Pythian Games for winning chariot racing contests.174 Philip II allegedly heard of the Olympic victory of his horse in either an individual horse race or chariot race on the same day his son Alexander the Great was born on either 19 or 20 July 356 BC.181 In addition to literary contests Alexander the Great also staged competitions for music and athletics across his empire.167 The Macedonians created their own athletic games and after the late 
4 th century BC nonroyal Macedonians competed and became victors in the Olympic Games100 and other athletic events such as the Argive Heraean Games. However athletics were a less favored pastime compared to hunting.182 Dining and cuisine Further information Ancient Greek cuisine and Wine in ancient Greece A banquet scene from a Macedonian tomb of Agios Athanasios Thessaloniki 
4 th century BC six men are shown reclining on couches with food arranged on nearby tables a male servant in attendance and female musicians providing entertainment.183 Ancient Macedonia produced very few fine foods or beverages that were highly appreciated elsewhere in the Greek world namely eels from the Strymonian Gulf and special wine brewed in Chalcidice.184 The earliest known use of flat bread as a plate for meat was made in Macedonia during the 
3 rd century BC which perhaps influenced the later trencher bread of medieval Europe if not Greek pita and Italian pizza.184 Cattle and goats were consumed although there was no notice of Macedonian mountain cheeses in literature until the Middle Ages.184 As exemplified by works such as the plays by the comedic playwright Menander Macedonian dining habits penetrated Athenian high society for instance the introduction of meats into the dessert course of a meal.185 The Macedonians also most likely introduced mattye to Athenian cuisine a dish usually made of chicken or other spiced salted and sauced meats served during the wine course.186 This particular dish was derided and connected with licentiousness and drunkenness in a play by the Athenian comic poet Alexis about the declining morals of Athenians in the age of Demetrius I of Macedon.187 The symposium plural symposia in the Macedonian and wider Greek realm was a banquet for the nobility and privileged class an occasion for feasting drinking entertainment and sometimes philosophical discussion.188 The hetairoi leading members of the Macedonian aristocracy were expected to attend such feasts with their king.113 They were also expected to accompany him on royal hunts for the acquisition of game meat as well as for sport.113 Symposia had several functions amongst which was providing relief from the hardship of battle and marching. Symposia were Greek traditions since Homeric times providing a venue for interaction amongst Macedonian elites. An ethos of egalitarianism surrounded symposia allowing all male elites to express ideas and concerns although builtup rivalries and excessive drinking often led to quarrels fighting and even murder. The degree of extravagance and propensity for violence set Macedonian symposia apart from classical Greek symposia.189 Like symposia hunting was another focus of elite activity and it remained popular throughout Macedonias history. Young men participating in symposia were only allowed to recline after having killed their first wild boar.190 Language Main article Ancient Macedonian language The Pella curse tablet Greek katadesmos from Prof. Radcliffe G. Edmonds III Bryn Mawr College. For administrative and political purposes Attic Greek seems to have operated as a lingua franca among the ethnolinguistically diverse communities of Macedonia and the north Aegean region creating a diglossic linguistic area.note 5 Attic Greek was standardized as the language of the court formal discourse and diplomacy from as early as the time of Archelaus at the end of the 
5 th century BC.191 Attic was further spread by Macedonias conquests.192 Although Macedonian continued to be spoken well into Antigonid times193 it became the prevalent oral dialect in Macedonia and throughout the Macedonianruled Hellenistic world.194 However Macedonian became extinct in either the Hellenistic or the Roman period and entirely replaced by Koine Greek.195 For instance Cleopatra VII Philopator the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt spoke Koine Greek as a first language and by her reign 5130 BC or some time before it the Macedonian language was no longer used.196 Attempts to classify Ancient Macedonian are hindered by the lack of surviving Ancient Macedonian texts it was a mainly oral language and most archaeological inscriptions indicate that in Macedonia there was no dominant written language besides Attic and later Koine Greek.195 All surviving epigraphical evidence from grave markers and public inscriptions is in Greek.197 Classification attempts are based on a vocabulary of 150200 words and 200 personal names assembled mainly from the 
5 th century lexicon of Hesychius of Alexandria and a few surviving fragmentary inscriptions coins and occasional passages in ancient sources.195 Most of the vocabulary is regular Greek with tendencies toward Doric Greek and Aeolic Greek. There can be found some Illyrian and Thracian elements.195198 The Pella curse tablet which was found in 1986 at Pella and dates to the mid
4 th century BC or slightly earlier199 is believed to be the only substantial attested text in Macedonian. The language of the tablet is a distinctly recognizable form of Northwest Greek. The tablet has been used to support the argument that ancient Macedonian was a Northwest Greek dialect and mainly a Doric Greek dialect.200201202102038 Hatzopouloss analysis revealed some tendencies toward the Aeolic Greek dialect.198 Hatzopoulos also states that the native language of the ancient Macedonians also betrays a slight phonetic influence from the languages of the original inhabitants of the region who were assimilated or expelled by the invading Macedonians.204 He also asserts that little is known about the languages of these original inhabitants aside from Phrygian spoken by the Bryges who migrated to Anatolia.204 However according to Hatzopoulos Bruno Helly expanded and improved his own earlier suggestion and presented the hypothesis of a NorthAchaean substratum extending as far north as the head of the Thermaic Gulf which had a continuous relation in prehistoric times both in Thessaly and Macedonia with the Northwest Greekspeaking populations living on the other side of the Pindus mountain range and contacts became cohabitation when the Argead Macedonians completed their wandering from Orestis to Lower Macedonia in the 
7 th century BC.205 According to this hypothesis Hatzopoulos concludes that the Macedonian dialect of the 
4 th century BC as attested in the Pella curse tablet was a sort of Macedonian koine resulting from the encounter of the idiom of the Aeolicspeaking populations around Mount Olympus and the Pierian Mountains whose phonetics had been influenced by a nonGreek possibly Phrygian or Pelasgian adstratum with the Northwest Greekspeaking Argead Macedonians hailing from Argos Orestikon who founded the kingdom of Lower Macedonia.205 An ancient Macedonian funerary stele with an epigram written at the top mid 
4 th century B.C. Vergina Macedonia Greece In Macedonian onomastics most personal names are recognizably Greek e.g. Alexandros Philippos Dionysios Apollonios Demetrios with some dating back to Homeric e.g. Ptolemaeos or Mycenean times and there are also a few nonGreek names Illyrian or Thracian e.g. Bithys. This material supports the observation that Macedonian personal names have a predominantly Greek character.195 Macedonian toponyms and hydronyms are mostly of Greek origin e.g. Aegae Dion Pieria Haliacmon as are the names of the months of the Macedonian calendar and the names of most of the deities the Macedonians worshiped. Hammond states that these are not late borrowings.206 Macedonian has a close structural and lexical affinity with other Greek dialects especially Northwest Greek and Thessalian.207208 Most of the words are Greek although some of these could represent loans or cognate forms.209210 Alternatively a number of phonological lexical and onomastic features set Macedonian apart.210211 These latter features possibly representing traces of a substrate language occur in what are considered to be particularly conservative systems of the language.212 Several hypotheses have consequently been proposed as to the position of Macedonian all of which broadly regard it as either a peripheral Greek dialect a closely related but separate language see Hellenic languages210213214 or a hybridized idiom incorporating Brygian Northwest Greek and Thessalian Greek.215216 Drawing on the similarities between Macedonian Greek and Brygian Fanula Papazoglu wrote that she formed an IndoEuropean macrodialectical group217 which according to Georgiev split before circa 
14 th
13 th century BC before the appearance of the main Greek dialects.218 The same data has been analyzed in an alternative manner which regards the formation of the main Greek dialects as a later convergence of related but distinct groups. According to this theory Macedonian did not fully participate in this process making its ultimate positionother than being a contiguous related minor languagedifficult to define.219 Hatzopoulos who offers a critical review of recent research on Macedonian speech argues that all available evidence points to the conclusion that Macedonian is a Greek dialect of the NorthWest group.220 Another source of evidence is metalinguistics and the question of mutual intelligibility. The available literary evidence has no details about the exact nature of Macedonian however it suggests that Macedonian and Greek were sufficiently different that there were communication difficulties between Greek and Macedonian contingents necessitating the use of interpreters as late as the time of Alexander the Great.221222223 Based on this evidence Papazoglou has written that Macedonian could not have been a Greek dialect224 however evidence for nonintelligibility exists for other ancient Greek dialects such as Aetolian225 and Aeolic Greek.226 Hornblower suggests that Greeks were intelligible to Macedonians without an interpreter227 as supported by the Athenian orator Aeschines.228 Livy wrote that when Aemilius Paulus called together representatives of the defeated Macedonian communities his Latin pronouncements were translated for the benefit of the assembled Macedonians into Greek.229 According to Hatzopoulos the sole direct attestation of Macedonian speech preserved in an ancient author is a verse in a nonAttic Greek dialect that the 
4 th century BC Athenian poet Strattis in his comedy The Macedonians places a character presumably Macedonian to give as an answer to the question of an Athenian       the sphyraena whats that       its what ye in Attica dub cestra.230 Georgios Giannakis writes that recent scholarship has established the position of ancient Macedonian within the dialect map of NorthWest Greek.220 Identity The Vergina Sun has been proposed as a symbol of ancient Macedonia or of the Argead dynasty by archeologists. See also Macedonia terminology Macedonians Greeks Ethnography and Cultural anthropology Nature of sources Further information Greek historiography Most ancient sources on the Macedonians come from outside Macedonia.176 According to Eugene N. Borza most of these sources are either illinformed hostile or both making the Macedonians one of the silent peoples of the ancient Mediterranean.231 Ernst Badian notes that nearly all surviving references to antagonisms and differences between Greeks and Macedonians exist in the written speeches of Arrian who lived during a period i.e. the Roman Empire in which any notion of an ethnic disparity between Macedonians and other Greeks was incomprehensible.232 Most of the literary evidence comes from later sources focusing on the campaigns of Alexander the Great rather than on Macedonia itself. Most contemporaneous evidence on Philip is Athenian and hostile.233 Moreover most ancient sources focus on the deeds of Macedonian kings in connection with political and military events such as the Peloponnesian War. Evidence about the ethnic identity of Macedonians of lower social status from the Archaic to the Hellenistic period is highly fragmentary and unsatisfactory.234 For information about Macedonia before Philip historians must rely on archaeological inscriptions and material remains a few fragments from historians whose work is now lost occasional passing mentions in Herodotus and Thucydides and universal histories from the Roman era.233 Ancient sources on the Argeads The god Dionysos riding a cheetah mosaic floor in the House of Dionysos at Pella Greece c. 330300 BC In Homer the term Argead was used as a collective designation for the Greeks   Argive Danaans.65235 The earliest version of the Temenid foundation myth was circulated by Alexander I via Herodotus during his apparent appearance at the Olympic Games.236 Despite protests from some competitors the Hellanodikai Judges of the Greeks accepted Alexanders Greek genealogy as did Herodotus and later Thucydides. Alexander had proved to the judges that he was an Argive Greek descendant from the mythical king of Argos Temenus.236237 Surviving fragments of the Pindaric ode seem to confirm his participation by praising his pentathlon victory.238 Nevertheless the historicity of Alexander Is participation in the Olympics has been doubted by some scholars who see the story as a piece of propaganda engineered by the Argeads and spread by Herodotus. Alexanders name does not appear in any list of Olympic victors.239 That there were protests from other competitors suggests that the supposed Argive genealogy of the Argeads was far from mainstream knowledge.240 Although some have formulated that the appellation Philhellene was surely not an appellation that could be given to an actual Greek240241 ancient Greek authors had confirmed that the term philhellene fond of Greece was also used as a title for Greek patriots.242243 Whatever the case according to Hall what mattered was that Alexander had played the genealogical game  la grecque and played it well perhaps even excessively.244 The emphasis on the Heraclean ancestry of the Argeads served to heroicize the royal family and to provide a sacred genealogy which established a divine right to rule over their subjects.245 The Macedonian royal family like those of Epirus emphasized blood and kinship in order to construct for themselves a heroic genealogy that sometimes also functioned as a Hellenic genealogy.246 Gold Macedonian stater of Alexander the Great struck at the Memphis mint dated c. 332323 BC. Obv Goddess Athena wearing Corinthian helmet. Rev Goddess Nike standing. PreHellenistic Greek writers expressed an ambiguity about the Greekness of Macedonians specifically their monarchic institutions and their background of Persian allianceoften portraying them as a potential barbarian threat to Greece.247 For example the late 
5 th century sophist Thrasymachus of Chalcedon wrote we Greeks are enslaved to the barbarian Archelaus Fragment 
2.2 48 This fragment is an adaptation of a verse from Euripides tragedy Telephos which was destined to become a stock expression. Hatzopoulos states that given the fragments conventional character it can hardly be taken literally as ethnological or linguistic evidence.249 The issue of Macedonian Hellenicity and that of their royal house was particularly pertinent in the 
4 th century BC regarding the politics of invading Persia. Demosthenes regarded Macedonias monarchy to be incongruous with an Athenianled PanHellenic alliance. He castigated Philip II for being not only no Greek nor related to the Greeks but not even a barbarian from any place that can be named with honor but a pestilent knave from Macedonia whence it was never yet possible to buy a decent slave.250 This was obvious political slander and is regarded as an insulting speech251 but the orator clearly could not do this if his audience was likely to regard his claim as nonsense it could not be said of a Theban or even a Thessalian252 however he also calls Meidias an Athenian statesman barbarian253 and in an event mentioned by Athenaeus the Boeotians the Thessalians and the Eleans were labeled barbarians.254 Demosthenes regarded only those who had reached the cultural standards of southern Greece as Greek and he did not take ethnological criteria into consideration255 and his corpus is considered by Eugene N. Borza as an oratory designed to sway public opinion at Athens and thereby to formulate public policy.231 Isocrates believed that only Macedonia was capable of leading a war against Persia he felt compelled to say that Phillip was a bona fide Hellene by discussing his Argead and Heraclean heritage.256257 Aeschines also sought to defend Philip and publicly described him at a meeting of the Athenian popular assembly as being entirely Greek.258 Moreover Philip in his letter to the council and people of Athens mentioned by Demosthenes places himself with the rest of the Greeks.259 Ancient sources on the Macedonian people Ancient frescos of Macedonian soldiers from the tomb of Agios Athanasios Thessaloniki Greece 
4 th century BC The earliest reference about Greek attitudes towards the Macedonian ethnos as a whole comes from Hesiods Catalogue of Women. The text maintains that the Macedonians descended from Makedon son of Zeus and Thyia daughter of Deucalion and was therefore a nephew of Hellen progenitor of the Greeks.37 Magnes brother of the eponymous Makedon was also said to be a son of Zeus and Thyia.47 The Magnetes descendants of Magnes were an Aeolian tribe according to Hammond this places the Macedonians among the Greeks.260 Engels also wrote that Hesiod counted the Macedonians as Greeks while Hall said that according to strict genealogical logic this excludes the population that bears Makedons name from the ranks of the Hellenes.261 Two later writers deny Makedon a lineage from Hellen Apollodorus 

3.8.1  makes him a son of Lycaon son of earthborn Pelasgus whilst PseudoScymnos 
6.2 2 makes him born directly from the earth262 Apollodorus 

3.8.1  however is technically identifying Makedon with the Greek royalty of Arcadia thus placing Macedonia within the orbit of the most archaic of Greek myths.263 At the end of the 
5 th century BC Hellanicus of Lesbos asserted Macedon was the son of Aeolus the latter a son of Hellen and ancestor of the Aeolians one of the major tribes of the Greeks.37 Hellanicus modified Hesiods genealogy by making Makedon the son of Aeolus firmly placing the Macedonians in the Aeolic Greekspeaking family.264 In addition to belonging to tribal groups such as the Aeolians Dorians Achaeans and Ionians Anson also stresses the fact that some Greeks even distinguished their ethnic identities based on the polis i.e. citystate they originally came from.265 These early writers and their formulation of genealogical relationships demonstrate that before the 
5 th century Greekness was defined on an ethnic basis and was legitimized by tracing descent from eponymous Hellen.266 Subsequently cultural considerations assumed greater importance. Fresco of an ancient Makedonian soldier thorakitai wearing chainmail armor and bearing a thureos shield 
3 rd century BC Herodotus regarded the Macedonians as either northern Greeks or an intermediate group between pure Greeks and barbarians.267 In the Histories 
5.2 
0.4  Herodotus calls king Alexander I an anr Helln Makedonn huparchos Ancient Greek     which translates to either a Greek viceroy of Macedonia268 or a Greek who ruled over Macedonians.267 In 
7.1 
30.3  he says that the Thessalians were the first of the Greeks to submit to Xerxes.269 In the first book of the Histories Herodotus recalls a reliable tradition according to which the Greek ethnos in its wandering was called Macedonian when it settled around Pindus and Dorian when it came to the Peloponnese270 and in the eighth book he groups several Greek tribes under Macedonians and Dorians implying that the Macedonians were Greeks.271272 In parts of his work Thucydides placed the Macedonians on his cultural continuum closer to barbarians than Hellenes273 or an intermediate category between Greeks and nonGreeks.274 In other parts he distinguishes between three groups fighting in the Peloponnesian War The Greeks including Peloponnesians the Macedonians and the barbarian Illyrians.274 Recounting Brasidas expedition to Lyncus Thucydides considers Macedonians separate from the barbarians he says In all there were about three thousand Hellenic heavy infantry accompanied by all the Macedonian cavalry with the Chalcidians near one thousand strong besides an immense crowd of barbarians275 and night coming on the Macedonians and the barbarian crowd took fright in a moment in one of those mysterious panics to which great armies are liable.276 More explicit is his recounting of Brasidas speech where he tells his Peloponnesian troops to dispel fear of fighting against barbarians because they had already fought against Macedonians.277 Euripides in his work Archelaus tells us that the Macedonians were Greeks.278 Ancient geographers differed in their views on the size of Macedonia and on the ethnicity of the Macedonians.279 Most ancient geographers did not include the core territories of the Macedonian kingdom in their definition of Greece the reasons for which are unknown. For example Strabo says that while Macedonia is of course part of Greece yet now since I am following the nature and shape of the places geographically I have chosen to classify it apart from the rest of Greece.279280 Strabo supports the Greek ethnicity of the Macedonian people and wrote of the Macedonians and the other Greeks281 as does Pausanias the latter of which did not include Macedonia in Hellas as indicated in Book 10 of his Description of Greece.279 Pausanias said that the Macedonians took part in the Amphictyonic League282 and that Caranus of Macedonthe mythical founder of the Argead dynastyset up a trophy after the Argive fashion for a victory against Cisseus.283 Macedonian terracotta figurine 
3 rd century BC the Persians referred to the Macedonians as Yaun Takabara Greeks with hats that look like shields.284 Isocrates defended Philips Greek origins but perhaps did not think the same of his people. In Halls version he wrote He Perdiccas I left the Greek world alone completely but he desired to hold the kingship in Macedonia for he understood that Greeks are not accustomed to submit themselves to monarchy whereas others are incapable of living their lives without domination of this sort ... for he alone of the Greeks deemed it fit to rule over an ethnically unrelated population.262 On the other hand Michael Cosmopoulos reports that Isocrates clearly states that the Macedonians were Greeks278 as in George Norlins translation Isocrates describes Perdiccas people as being rather of kindred race with the Greeks.285 Nevertheless Philip named the federation of Greek states he created with Macedon at its headnowadays referred to as the League of Corinthas simply The Hellenes i.e. Greeks. The Macedonians were granted two seats in the exclusively Greek Great Amphictyonic League in 346 BC when the Phocians were expelled. Badian sees it as a personal honour awarded to Phillip and not to the Macedonian people as a whole.286 Aeschines said that Phillips father Amyntas III joined other Greeks in the Panhellenic congress of the Lacedaemonian allies known as the Congress of Sparta in a vote to help Athens recover possession of Amphipolis.287 Amyntas son and Phillips older brother Perdiccas III served as theorodokos Ancient Greek  or  in the Panhellenic Games that took place in Epidaurus around 360359 BC.288 With Philips conquest of Greece Greeks and Macedonians enjoyed privileges at the royal court and there was no social distinction among his court hetairoi although Philips armies were only ever led by Macedonians. The process of Greek and Macedonian syncretism culminated during the reign of Alexander the Great and he allowed other Greeks to command his armies.289 In his speech at the battle of Issus mentioned in Arrians Anabasis Alexander is seen to place himself among the Greeks further acknowledging that while the Greek allies of Darius III fight for pay his own army fights for the Greek cause.290 The persisting antagonism between Macedonians and other Greeks however continued into Antigonid times.291 Some Greek citizens continued to rebel against their Macedonian overlords throughout the Hellenistic era.292 They rejoiced on the death of Phillip II293 and they revolted against Alexanders Antigonid successors. The Greeks called this conflict the Hellenic War.294 However PanHellenic sloganeering was used by Greeks against Antigonid dominance and also by Macedonians to corral popular support throughout Greece. Those who considered Macedonia as a political enemy such as Hypereides and Chremonides likened the Lamian War and Chremonidean War respectively to the earlier GrecoPersian Wars and efforts to liberate Greeks from tyranny.295 Yet even those who considered Macedonia an ally such as Isocrates were keen to stress the differences between their kingdom and the Greek city states to assuage fears about the extension of the Macedonianstyle monarchism into the governance of their poleis.296 After the 
3 rd century BC and especially in Roman times the Macedonians were consistently regarded as Greeks.297 To begin with Polybius considers the Macedonians as Greeks and sets them apart from their neighboring nonGreek tribes.278 For example in his Histories the Acarnanian character Lyciscus tells the Spartans that they are of the same tribe as the Achaeans and the Macedonians298 who should be honoured because throughout nearly their whole lives are ceaselessly engaged in a struggle with the barbarians for the safety of the Greeks.299 Polybius also used the phrase Macedonia and the rest of Greece300 and says that Philip V of Macedon associates himself with the rest of the Greeks.301 In his text History of Rome Livy states that the Macedonians Aetolians and Acarnanians were all men of the same language.302 Similar opinions are shared by Arrian303 Dionysius of Halicarnassus304 Strabo305 and Plutarch who wrote of Aristotle advising Alexander to have regard for the Greeks as for friends and kindred306 more specifically to be a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants.307 M. B. Hatzopoulos points out that passages in Arrians text also reveal that the terms Greeks and Macedonians were at times synonymous. For instance when Alexander the Great held a feast accompanied by Macedonians and Persians with religious rituals performed by Persian magi and Greek seers the latter of whom were Macedonians.308 Any preconceived ethnic differences between Greeks and Macedonians faded soon after the Roman conquest of Macedonia by 148 BC and then the rest of Greece with the defeat of the Achaean League by the Roman Republic at the Battle of Corinth 146 BC.309 The Ionians with shieldhats Old Persian cuneiform  Yaun takabar310 depicted on the tomb of Xerxes I at Naqshe Rustam were probably Macedonian soldiers in the service of the Achaemenid army wearing their characteristic kausia c.480 BC.311 The Persians referred to both Greeks and Macedonians as Yauna Ionians their term for Greeks though they distinguished the Yauna by the sea and across the sea from the Yaun Takabara or Greeks with hats that look like shields ostensibly referring to the Macedonian kausia hat.312 According to another interpretation the Persians used such terms in a geographical rather than an ethnic sense. Yauna and its various attributes possibly referred to regions to the north and west of Asia Minor.313 Overall Persian inscriptions indicate that the Persians considered the Macedonians to be Greeks.314 In Hellenistic times most Egyptians and Syrians included the Macedonians among the larger category of Greeks as the Persians had done earlier.312 Modern discourse Modern scholarly discourse has produced several hypotheses about the Macedonians place within the Greek world. Considering material remains of Greekstyle monuments buildings inscriptions dating from the 
5 th century and the predominance of Greek personal names one school of thought says that the Macedonians were truly Greeks who had retained a more archaic lifestyle than those living in southern Greece. This cultural discrepancy was used during the political struggles in Athens and Macedonia in the 
4 th century.267 This has been the predominant viewpoint since the 
20 th century. Worthington wrote ... not much need to be said about the Greekness of ancient Macedonia it is undeniable.315 Hatzopoulos argues that there was no real ethnic difference between Macedonians and Greeks only a political distinction contrived after the creation of the League of Corinth in 337 BC which was led by Macedonia through the leagues elected hegemon Philip II despite him not being a member of the league itself.316 Hatzopoulos stresses the fact that Macedonians and other peoples such as the Epirotes and Cypriots despite speaking a Greek dialect worshiping in Greek cults engaging in panhellenic games and upholding traditional Greek institutions nevertheless occasionally had their territories excluded from contemporary geographic definitions of Hellas and were even considered nonGreek barbarians by some.317 Other academics who concur that the difference between the Macedonians and Greeks was a political rather than a true ethnic discrepancy include Michael B. Sakellariou318 Robert Malcolm Errington258 and Craige B. Champion.319 A mosaic of the Kasta Tomb in Amphipolis depicting the abduction of Persephone by Pluto 
4 th century BC Another perspective interprets the literary evidence and the archaeologicalcultural differences between Macedonia and centralsouthern Greece before the 
6 th century and beyond as evidence that the Macedonians were originally nonGreek tribes who underwent a process of Hellenization.320321 Accepting that political factors played a part they highlight the degree of antipathy between Macedonians and Greeks which was of a different quality to that seen among other Greek stateseven those with a longterm history of mutual animosity e.g. Sparta and Athens.322 According to these scholars the Macedonians came to be regarded as northern Greeks only with the ongoing Hellenization of Macedonia and the emergence of Rome as a common enemy in the west. This coincides with the period during which ancient authors such as Polybius and Strabo called the ancient Macedonians Greeks.320 By this point to have been a Greek could have defined a quality of culture and intelligence rather than a racial or ethnic affinity.323324 In the context of ethnic origins of the companions of the Antigonid kings James L. ONeil distinguishes Macedonians and Greeks as separate ethnic groups the latter becoming more prominent in Macedonian affairs and the royal court after Alexander the Greats reign.325 Others have adopted both views. According to Sansone there is no question that in the fifth and fourth centuries there were noticeable difference between the Greeks and the Macedonians yet the issue of Macedonian Hellenicity was ultimately a political one.326 Hall adds to ask whether the Macedonians really were Greek or not in antiquity is ultimately a redundant question given the shifting semantics of Greekness between the 
6 th and 
4 th centuries BC. What cannot be denied however is that the cultural commodification of Hellenic identity that emerged in the 
4 th century might have remained a provincial artifact confined to the Balkan peninsula had it not been for the Macedonians.327 Eugene Borza emphasized the Macedonians made their mark in antiquity as Macedonians not as a tribe of some other people328 but argued that the highlanders or Makedones of the mountainous regions of western Macedonia are derived from northwest Greek stock.329 Worthington concludes that there is still more than enough evidence and reasoned theory to suggest that the Macedonians were racially Greek.330 Anson argues that some Hellenic authors expressed complex if not everchanging and ambiguous ideas about the exact ethnic identity of the Macedonians who were considered by some as barbarians and by others as semiGreek or fully Greek.331 Panagiotis Filos notes that the term barbarian was often used by ancient Greek authors in a very broad sense referring not only to nonGreek populations but also to Greek populations on the fringe of the Greek world with dialectal differences such as the Macedonians.332 The term was also known for being used in a pejorative and politically motivated manner especially by the Athenians to deride other Greek tribes and states such as Epirotes Eleans Boeotians and Aeolicspeakers.333334 Roger D. Woodard asserts that in addition to persisting uncertainty in modern times about the proper classification of the Macedonian language and its relation to Greek ancient authors also presented conflicting ideas such as Demosthenes when labeling Philip II of Macedon inaccurately as a barbarian335 whereas Polybius called the Achaeans and Macedonians as homophylos i.e. part of the same race or kin.336337 Carol J. King elaborates that finding the reason why ancient Greeks themselves differentiated between Greeks and Macedonians is limited by the fact that if one seeks historical truth about an ancient people who have left no definitive record one may have to let go of the hope for a definitive answer especially considering that ancient Macedonia was composed of Greeks people akin to Greeks and nonGreeks.338 Simon Hornblower supports the Greek identity of the Macedonians taking into consideration their origin language cults and customs.339 See also Demographic history of Macedonia  Historical overview of Macedonias demographics Government of Macedonia ancient kingdom  Political history topic History of Macedonia ancient kingdom Macedonians Greeks  Greek regional and historical population group Macednon  ancient region of MacedoniaPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback References Footnotes  1718192021222324  Pioneered by Friedrich Wilhelm Sturz 18084 and subsequently supported by Olivier Masson 19965 Michael MeierBrgger 20036 Johannes Engels 20107 J.

For his victory Caranus set up a trophy after the Argive fashion but it is said to have been upset by a lion from Olympus which then vanished. Caranus they assert realized that it was a mistaken policy to incur the undying hatred of the nonGreeks dwelling around and so they say the rule was adopted that no king of Macedonia neither Caranus himself nor any of his successors should set up trophies if they were ever to gain the goodwill of their neighbors. This story is confirmed by the fact that Alexander set up no trophies neither for his victory over Dareius nor for those he won in India.  Engels 2010 p. 87 Olbrycht 2010 pp. 343344.  Isocrates.

Engels suggests this perhaps because the Epirotes did not try to dominate the Greek world as Philip II of Macedon had done. See Engels 2010 pp. 8384.  Sakellariou 1983 pp. 52.

Allowing that there were living in ancient Macedonia throughout the Archaic Classical and Hellenistic periods people who were Greek people who were akin to Greeks and people who were not Greek if one seeks historical truth about an ancient people who have left no definitive record one may have to let go of the hope for a definitive answer. The ancient Greeks themselves differentiated between Greeks and Macedonians and if the difference was not one of written language then it ought to be constructive to consider what factors did differentiate the Macedoniansin the opinion of ancient Greeks.  Hornblower 2008 p. 58. The question Were the Macedonians Greeks perhaps needs to be chopped up further. The Macedonian kings emerge as Greeks by criterion one namely shared blood and personal names indicate that Macedonians generally moved north from Greece. The kings the elite and the generality of the Macedonians were Greeks by criteria two and three that is religion and language. Macedonian customs criterion four were in certain respects unlike those of a normal apart perhaps from the institutions which I have characterized as feudal. The crude oneword answer to the question has to be yes. Bibliography Adams Winthrop Lindsay 2010. Alexanders Successors to 221 BC. In Roisman Joseph Worthington Ian eds..
