19 th Dynasty Menpehtyre Ramesses I or Ramses was the founding pharaoh of ancient Egypts 
19 th Dynasty. The dates for his short reign are not completely known but the timeline of late 12921290 BC is frequently cited2 as well as 12951294 BC.3 While Ramesses I was the founder of the 
19 th Dynasty his brief reign mainly serves to mark the transition between the reign of Horemheb who had stabilized Egypt in the late 
18 th Dynasty and the rule of the powerful pharaohs of his own dynasty in particular his son Seti I and grandson Ramesses II. Originsedit See also Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt family tree Pharaoh Ramses I making an offering before Osiris Allard Pierson Museum. Originally called Paramessu Ramesses I was of nonroyal birth being born into a noble military family from the Nile Delta region perhaps near the former Hyksos capital of Avaris. He was a son of a troop commander called Seti. His uncle Khaemwaset an army officer married Tamwadjesy the matron of Tutankhamuns4 Harem of Amun who was a relative of Huy the viceroy of Kush an important state post.5 This shows the high status of Ramesses family. Ramesses I found favor with Horemheb the last pharaoh of the tumultuous Eighteenth Dynasty who appointed the former as his vizier. Ramesses also served as the High Priest of Set6  as such he would have played an important role in the restoration of the old religion following the Amarna heresy of a generation earlier under Akhenaten. Horemheb himself had been a nobleman from outside the immediate royal family who rose through the ranks of the Egyptian army to serve as the royal advisor to Tutankhamun and Ay and ultimately pharaoh. Since Horemheb had no surviving children he ultimately chose Ramesses to be his heir in the final years of his reign presumably because Ramesses I was both an able administrator and had a son Seti I and a grandson the future Ramesses II to succeed him and thus avoid any succession difficulties. Upon his accession Ramesses assumed a prenomen or royal name. When transliterated the name is mnptyr which is usually interpreted as Menpehtyre meaning Established by the strength of Ra. However he is better known by his nomen or personal name. This is transliterated as rmssw and is usually realised as Ramessu or Ramesses meaning Ra bore him. Already an old man when he was crowned Ramesses appointed his son the later pharaoh Seti I to serve as the Crown Prince and chosen successor. Seti was charged with undertaking several military operations during this timein particular an attempt to recoup some of Egypts lost possessions in Syria. Ramesses appears to have taken charge of domestic matters most memorably he completed the second pylon at Karnak Temple begun under Horemheb. Reign Lengthedit Reliefs from the Abydos chapel of Ramesses I. The chapel was specifically built and dedicated by Seti I in memory of his late father. Mummy of Ramesses I Ramesses I enjoyed a brief reign as evidenced by the general paucity of contemporary monuments mentioning him the king had little time to build any major buildings in his reign and was hurriedly buried in a small and hastily finished tomb.7 According to the Jewish historian Josephus in his book Contra Apionem which translated Manethos Aegyptiaca Manetho assigns this king a reign of 16 months but this pharaoh certainly ruled Egypt for a minimum of 17 months based on his highest known date which is a Year 2 II Peret day 20 Louvre C57 stela which ordered the provision of new endowments of food and priests for the temple of Ptah within the Egyptian fortress of Buhen.8 In contrast Ramesses Is son and successor Seti I assumed the throne 5 months later after the erection of this stela on III Shemu day 24 which means that Ramesses I had a minimum reign of 17 months. or 1 year and 5 months.2 However based on a papyrus document published by Robert J. Demare in a 2023 publication Demare argues that Ramesses Is predecessor Horemheb died on III Shemu 22 based on evidence in Papyrus Turin Cat. 1898  Cat. 1937  Cat. 2094244 which is a journal diary.9 If confirmed this would mean that Ramesses I actually had a reign of approximately 2 Full years since he would have ascended to the throne around III Shemu 23 soon after Horemhebs death on III Shemu 22 and died about 2 years later around the very same day since Ramesses Is son Seti I succeeded his father on III Shemu 
24.1 0 Ramesses Is only known action was to order the provision of endowments for the aforementioned Nubian temple at Buhen and the construction of a chapel and a temple which was to be finished by his son at Abydos.11 The aged Ramesses was buried in the Valley of the Kings. His tomb discovered by Giovanni Belzoni in 1817 and designated KV16 is small in size and gives the impression of having been completed with haste. Joyce Tyldesley states that Ramesses Is tomb consisted of a single corridor and one unfinished room whose walls after a hurried coat of plaster were painted to show the king with his gods with Osiris allowed a prominent position. The red granite sarcophagus too was painted rather than carved with inscriptions which due to their hasty preparation included a number of unfortunate errors.7 Seti I his son and successor later built a small chapel with fine reliefs in memory of his deceased father Ramesses I at Abydos. In 1911 John Pierpont Morgan donated several exquisite reliefs from this chapel to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.12 Rediscovery and repatriationedit Fragment of a stela showing Amun enthroned. Mut wearing the double crown stands behind him. Both are being offered by Ramesses I now lost. From Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology London A mummy currently believed to be that of Ramesses I was stolen from Egypt and displayed in a private Canadian museum for many years before being repatriated. The mummys identity cannot be conclusively determined but is most likely to be that of Ramesses I based on CT scans Xrays skull measurements and radiocarbon dating tests by researchers at Emory University as well as aesthetic interpretations of family resemblance. Moreover the mummys arms were found crossed high across his chest which was a position reserved solely for Egyptian royalty until 600 BC.13 The mummy had been stolen from the Royal Cache in Deir elBahari by the AbuRassul family of grave robbers and sold by Turkish viceconsular agent Mustapha Aga Ayat at Luxor1415 to Dr. James Douglas who brought it to North America around 1860. Douglas used to purchase Egyptian antiquities for his friend Sydney Barnett who then placed it in The Niagara Falls Museum. At the time the its identity of the mummified man was unknown.16 The mummy remained in the museum through moves to Niagara Falls New York and Niagara Falls Ontario next to other curiosities for more than 130 years.16 The mummy was displayed as a A Prince of Egypt but despite occasional speculation from visitors that he might be exactly that nothing further was done.16 When the owner of the museum decided to sell his property Canadian businessman William Jamieson purchased the contents of the museum and with the help of Canadian Egyptologist Gayle Gibson identified their great value.17 In 1999 Jamieson sold the Egyptian artifacts in the collection including the various mummies to the Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University in Atlanta Georgia for US2 million.16 The mummy was returned to Egypt on October 24 2003 with full official honors and is on display at the Luxor Museum.18 Portrayals in fictionedit In The Ten Commandments 1956 film he was played by Ian Keith as the Pharaoh of the Oppression. In the miniseries In the Beginning he was portrayed by Christopher Lee as the Pharaoh encountered by Joseph. Lee had previously played Ramses grandson Ramesses II in Moses.
