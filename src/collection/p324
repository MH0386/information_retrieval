Calendar epochsedit 3114 BC According to the most widely accepted correlations between the Western calendar and the calendar systems of preColumbian Mesoamerica the mythical starting point of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar cycle occurs in this year.4 The Long Count calendar used and refined most notably by the Maya civilization but also attested in some other earlier Mesoamerican cultures consisted of a series of interlocked cycles or periods of daycounts which mapped out a linear sequence of days from a notional starting point. The system originated sometime in the Mid to Late Preclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology during the latter half of the 
1 st millennium BC.5 The starting point of the most commonly used highestorder cycle
6 the baktuncycle consisting of thirteen baktuns of 144000 days eachwas projected back to an earlier mythical date. This date is equivalent to 11 August 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or 6 September in the proleptic Julian calendar using the correlation known as the GoodmanMartnezThompson GMT correlation. The GMTcorrelation is worked out with the Long Count starting date equivalent to the Julian Day Number JDN equal to 584283 and is accepted by most Mayanist scholars as providing the best fit with the ethnohistorical data.7 Two succeeding dates the 
12 th and 13 August Gregorian have also been supported with the 
13 th JDN  584285 the astronomical or Lounsbury correlation attracting significant support as according better with astronomical observational data.8 Although it is still contended which of these three dates forms the actual starting base of the Long Count the correlation to one of this triad of dates is definitively accepted by almost all contemporary Mayanists. All other earlier or later correlation proposals are now discounted.7 The end of the thirteenth baktun was either on December 21 or 23 of 2012 supposed end of the world. 3102 BC According to Puranic sourcesa Krishnas death marked the start of Kali Yuga which is dated to 1718 February 3102 BCE.1415 Lasting for 432000 years 1200 divine years Kali Yuga began 5125 years ago and has 426875 years left as of 2024 CE.161718 Kali Yuga will end in the year 428899 CE.

The Krita yuga lasts 4000 godyears with a dawn and dusk of 400 godyears each or a total of 4800 godyears Treta a total of 3600 godyears Dvapara 2400 godyears and Kali the current yuga 1200 godyears. A mahayuga thus lasts 12000 godyears ... Since each godyear lasts 360 human years a mahayuga is 4320000 years long in human time. Two thousand mahayugas form one kalpa eon and pralaya which is itself but one day in the life of Brahma whose full life lasts 100 years the present is the midpoint of his life. Each kalpa is followed by an equally long period of abeyance pralaya in which the universe is asleep. Seemingly the universe will come to an end at the end of Brahmas life but Brahmas too are innumerable and a new universe is reborn with each new Brahma.  YUGA Each yuga is progressively shorter than the preceding one corresponding to a decline in the moral and physical state of humanity. Four such yugas called ... after throws of an Indian game of dice make up a mahayuga great yuga ... The first yuga Krita was an age of perfection lasting 1728000 years. The fourth and most degenerate yuga Kali began in 3102 BCE and will last 432000 years. At the close of the Kali yuga the world will be destroyed by fire and flood to be recreated as the cycle resumes. In a partially competing vision of time Vishnus 
10 th and final AVATAR KALKI is described as bringing the present cosmic cycle to a close by destroying the evil forces that rule the Kali yuga and ushering in an immediate return to the idyllic Krita yuga.  Gupta S. V. 2010. Ch.

60 day years each 12 months. Parardha is 50 Brahma years and we are in the 
2 nd half of his life. After 100 years of Brahma the universe starts with a new Brahma. We are currently in the 
28 th Kali yuga of the first day of the 
51 st year of the second Parardha in the reign of the 
7 th Vaivasvata Manu. This is the 
51 st year of the present Brahma and so about 155 trillion years have elapsed. The current Kali Yuga Iron Age began at midnight on 1718 February 3102 BC in the proleptic Julian calendar.  Godwin 2011 p. 301 The Hindu astronomers agree that the Dvapara Yuga ended and Kali Yuga began at midnight between February 17 and 18 3102 BCE. Consequently Kali Yuga is due to end about 427000 CE whereupon a new Golden Age will dawn. Referencesedit Burgess Rev. Ebenezer 1935 1860. Ch. 1 Of the Mean Motions of the Planets..
