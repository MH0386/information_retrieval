This was the first of three socalled Kingdom periods which mark the high points of civilization in the Nile Valley. It began when Egypt was ruled by the Third Dynasty through the Sixth Dynasty 26862181 BC. Many Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth Dynasties in the Old Kingdom. The Old Kingdom was followed by a period of disunity called the First Intermediate Period or as the Egyptians called it the first illness. The royal capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom was at Memphis. This is where Djoser set up his court. The Old Kingdom is known for the large number of pyramids. These were built as tombs for the pharoahs. The Old Kingdom is called the Age of the Pyramids. Third Dynastychange  change source The Third Dynasty ruled from 2686 to 2613 BC.

Bones have been found at the Red Pyramid but there is no evidence that this is Sneferus body. 26132589 BC Khufu Greek form Cheops. Built the great pyramid of Giza. In some early sources Khufu is listed as the third of his family to rule but there is no known record of a pharaoh between Sneferu and Khufu. It is possible that there might have been a short reign of some elder brother of Khufu whose inscriptions names and monuments have gone for one reason or another. 25892566 BC Djedefra Radjedef Believed to have created the Great Sphinx of Giza as a monument to his father. He also created a pyramid at Abu Rawash. The stones from this pyramid were reused by the Romans. The pyramid may have been the highest ever built about 20 meters taller than the Great Pyramid of Giza because of its elevated location rather than the size from base to tip. 25662558 BC Khafre Greek form Chephren His pyramid is the second largest in Giza.

8 th Dynasties. Short reign c. 2184 BC  2181 BC First Intermediate Periodchange  change source The First Intermediate Period 21812060 BC is between the end of the Old Kingdom and the start of the Middle Kingdom.

The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age. The Union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine. Around 2160 BC a new line of pharaohs tried to reunite Lower Egypt from their capital in Herakleopolis Magna. Another line of pharaohs at Thebes was reuniting Upper Egypt and a clash between the two rival dynasties was inevitable. Around 2055 BC Mentuhotep II the son and successor of pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands. This was the start of the Middle Kingdom.

During this time the Hyksos who later became the Fifteenth Dynasty arrived in Egypt. The Thirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the Twelfth Dynasty and was unable to hold onto the two lands of Egypt. Either at the start of the dynasty c. 1805 BC or toward the middle of it in c. 1710 BC the ruling family in Xois located in the marshes of the eastern Delta broke away from the central authority to form the Canaanite Fourteenth Dynasty.
