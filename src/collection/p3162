It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains nonarticle pages or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories. This is a tracking category. It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedias categorization scheme. This category is hidden on its member pagesunless the corresponding user preference Appearance  Show hidden categories is set. These categories can be used to track build and organize lists of pages needing attention en masse for example pages using deprecated syntax or that may need to be edited at someones earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or subcategories into a larger more efficient list discriminated by classifications. This is a category to help keep count of the total number of articles with the citation needed template. They should all be in one of the dated categories which can be found at CategoryArticles with unsourced statements. Want to help reduce the backlogedit With 519798 articles in this category it can be hard to choose which one to work on.
