6 th Dynasty Pepi I Meryre also Pepy I was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh third king of the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt who ruled for over 40 years at the turn of the 
24 th and 
23 rd centuries BC toward the end of the Old Kingdom period. He was the son of Teti the founder of the dynasty and ascended the throne only after the brief intervening reign of the shadowy Userkare. His mother was Iput who may have been a daughter of Unas the final ruler of the preceding Fifth Dynasty. Pepi I who had at least six consorts was succeeded by his son Merenre Nemtyemsaf I with whom he may have shared power in a coregency at the very end of his reign. Pepi II Neferkare who might also have been Pepi Is son succeeded Merenre. Several difficulties accumulated during Pepis reign beginning with the possible murder of his father and the ensuing reign of Userkare. Later probably after his twentieth year of reign Pepi faced a harem conspiracy hatched by one of his consorts who may have tried to have her son designated heir to the throne and possibly another conspiracy involving his vizier at the end of his reign. Confronted with the protracted decline of pharaonic power and the emergence of dynasties of local officials Pepi reacted with a vast architectural program involving the construction of temples dedicated to local gods and numerous chapels for his own cult throughout Egypt reinforcing his presence in the provinces. Egypts prosperity allowed Pepi to become the most prolific builder of the Old Kingdom. At the same time Pepi favored the rise of small provincial centres and recruited officials of nonnoble extraction to curtail the influence of powerful local families. Continuing Tetis policy Pepi expanded a network of warehouses accessible to royal envoys and from which taxes and labor could easily be collected. Finally he buttressed his power after the harem conspiracy by forming alliances with Khui the provincial nomarch of Abydos marrying two of his daughters Ankhesenpepi I and Ankhesenpepi II and making both Khuis wife Nebet and her son Djau viziers. The Egyptian states external policy under Pepi comprised military campaigns against Nubia Sinai and the southern Levant landing troops on the Levantine coast using Egyptian transport boats. Trade with Byblos Ebla and the oases of the Western Desert flourished while Pepi launched mining and quarrying expeditions to Sinai and further afield. Pepi had a pyramid complex built for his funerary cult in Saqqara next to which he built at least a further six pyramids for his consorts. Pepis pyramid which originally stood 
52.5  m 172 ft tall and an accompanying high temple followed the standard layout inherited from the late Fifth Dynasty. The most extensive corpus of Pyramid Texts from the Old Kingdom cover the walls of Pepi Is burial chamber antechamber and much of the corridor leading to it. For the first time these texts also appear in some of the consorts pyramids. Excavations revealed a bundle of viscera and a mummy fragment both presumed to belong to the pharaoh. Pepis complex called Pepi Mennefer remained the focus of his funerary cult well into the Middle Kingdom and ultimately gave its name to the nearby capital of Egypt Memphis. Pepis cult stopped early in the Second Intermediate Period. Pepis monuments began to be quarried for their stone in the New Kingdom and in the Mamluk era they were almost entirely dismantled. Familyedit Parentsedit Pepi was the son of the pharaoh Teti and Iput.16 Her parentage is directly attested to by a relief on a decree uncovered in Coptos that mentions Iput as Pepis mother17 by inscriptions in her mortuary temple mentioning her titles as mother of a king and as mother of Pepi
18 note 2 by the architecture of her tomb which had been changed from an original mastaba form into a pyramid on the accession of her son to the throne18 and by her mention as being Pepis mother on the Sixth Dynasty royal annals.19 Iput may have been a daughter of Unas the last pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty3 although this remains uncertain and debated.20 She seems to have died before Pepis accession to the throne.21 The observation that Teti was most probably Pepis father follows from the location of Iputs tomb next to Tetis pyramid as was customary for a queen consort.19 Consortsedit Ankhesenpepi II shown on a relief from her mortuary temple Imhotep Museum Egyptologists have identified six consorts of Pepi I with near certainty.22 Pepis bestattested consorts were Ankhesenpepi I and Ankhesenpepi II
23 note 3 who both bore future pharaohs and were daughters of the nomarch of Abydos Khui and his wife Nebet.2325 Further consorts are Nubwenet2627 InenekInti28 who became one of Pepis viziers22 and Mehaa also called Haaheru. All were buried in pyramids adjacent to that of Pepi.29 Relief fragments from the necropolis surrounding Pepis pyramid mention another consort Sebwetet.30 Two more consorts have been proposed for Pepi I based on partial evidence. The first is Nedjeftet2531 whose name is recorded on blocks excavated in the necropolis adjacent to Pepis pyramid. The identification of Nedjeftet as Pepis consort remains uncertain owing to the lack of inscriptions explicitly naming her husband.32 Given the location of Nedjeftets blocks in the necropolis she may be the owner of a pyramid west of Pepis.3334 The second is another consort named Behenu who was buried in the second largest queen pyramid of Pepis necropolis north of his. She could either be one of his consorts or a consort of Pepi II.35 A final unnamed consort only referred to by her title WeretYamtes36 meaning great of affection37 is known from inscriptions uncovered in the tomb of Weni an official serving Pepi. This consort whose name is purposefully left unmentioned by Weni38 conspired against Pepi and was prosecuted when the conspiracy was discovered.36 Childrenedit Pepi fathered at least four sons. Ankhesenpepi I probably bore him the future pharaoh Merenre Nemtyemsaf I.note 4 Ankhesenpepi II was the mother of Pepi II Neferkare40 who was probably born at the very end of Pepi Is reign given he was only six upon ascending the throne after Merenres rule.39 While a majority of Egyptologists favor this hypothesis41 an alternative one holds that Pepi II could be a son of Merenre.35 Another of Pepi Is sons was Tetiankh meaning Teti lives whose mother has yet to be identified.40 Tetiankh is known only from an ink inscription bearing his name discovered in Pepis pyramid.17 Buried nearby is Prince Hornetjerkhet a son of Pepi with Mehaa.40 At least three of Pepi Is daughters have been tentatively identified all future consorts of Pepi II.42 The first Meritites IVnote 5 was the kings eldest daughter and was buried in the necropolis surrounding her fathers pyramid.44 The second is Neith
45 note 6 whom he fathered with Ankhesenpepi I.47 She may have been the mother of Pepi IIs successor Merenre Nemtyemsaf II.45 The third is Iput II48 whose identity as Pepis daughter remains uncertain because her title of daughter of the king may only be honorary.42 Chronologyedit Relative chronologyedit Pepi Is cartouche reading Meryre on the Abydos King List49 The relative chronology of Pepi Is reign is well established by historical records contemporary artifacts and archeological evidence which agree he succeeded Userkare and was succeeded by Merenre I Nemtyemsaf.50 For example the nearcontemporary South Saqqara Stone a royal annal inscribed during the reign of Pepi II gives the succession Teti  Userkare  Pepi I  Merenre I making Pepi the third king of the Sixth Dynasty. Two more historical sources agree with this chronology the Abydos king list written under Seti I which places Pepi Is cartouche as the 
36 th entry between those of Userkare and Merenre49 and the Turin canon a list of kings on papyrus dating to the reign of Ramses II which records Pepi I in the fourth column third row.51 Historical sources against this order of succession include the Aegyptiaca  a history of Egypt written in the 
3 rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II 283  246 BC by Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. According to the Byzantine scholar George Syncellus Africanus wrote that the Aegyptiaca mentioned the succession Othos  Phius  Methusuphis at the start of the Sixth Dynasty. Othos Phius in Greek  and Methusuphis are understood to be the Hellenized forms for Teti Pepi I and Merenre respectively
52 note 7 meaning that the Aegyptiaca omits Userkare. Manethos reconstruction of the early Sixth Dynasty agrees with the Karnak king list written under Thutmosis III. This list places Pepis birth name immediately after that of Teti in the seventh entry of the second row.54 Unlike other sources such as the Turin canon the purpose of the Karnak king list was not to be exhaustive but rather to list a selection of royal ancestors to be honoured. Similarly the Saqqara Tablet written under Ramses II55 omits Userkare with Pepis name given as the 
25 th entry after that of Teti.49 Length of reignedit Alabaster statuette of Pepi I dressed for the Sed Festival Brooklyn Museum56 The length of Pepi Is reign remains somewhat uncertain although as of 2021 the consensus is that he ruled over Egypt for over 40 years possibly 49 or 50 years57 and possibly longer.58 During the Old Kingdom period the Egyptians counted years from the beginning of the reign of the current king. These years were referred to by the number of cattle counts which had taken place since the reigns start.59 The cattle count was an important event aimed at evaluating the amount of taxes to be levied on the population. This involved counting cattle oxen and small livestock.60 During the early Sixth Dynasty this count was probably biennialnote 8 occurring every two years.5964 The South Saqqara Stone and an inscription in Hatnub both record the 
25 th cattle count under Pepi I his highest known date.6566 Accepting a biennial count this indicates that Pepi reigned for 49 years. That a 
50 th year of reign could have also been recorded on the royal annal cannot be discounted however because of the damaged state of the South Saqqara Stone.67 Another historical source supporting such a long reign is Africanus epitome of Manethos Aegyptiaca which credits Pepi I with a reign of 53 years.14
52 note 9 Archaeological evidence in favor of a long reign for Pepi I includes his numerous building projects and many surviving objects made in celebration of his first Sed festival which was meant to rejuvenate the king and was first celebrated on the 
30 th year of a kings rule. For example numerous alabaster ointment vessels celebrating Pepis first Sed festival have been discovered. They bear a standard inscriptions reading The king of Upper and Lower Egypt Meryre may he be given life for ever. The first occasion of the Sed festival.69 Examples can now be found in museums throughout the world57071 Muse du Louvre Walters Art Museum Metropolitan Museum of Art British Museum The Sed festival had a considerable importance for Old Kingdom kings.63 Representations of it were part of the typical decoration of temples associated with the ruler during the Old Kingdom whether the king had actually celebrated it or not.72 As further evidence of the importance of this event in Pepis case the state administration seems to have had a tendency to mention his first jubilee repeatedly in the years following its celebration until the end of his rule in connection with building activities. For example Pepis final 
25 th cattle count reported on the Sixth Dynasty royal annals is associated with his first Sed festival even though it probably had taken place some 19 years prior.63 Politicsedit Ascending the throneedit Kneeling statuette of Pepi I Brooklyn Museum
73 note 10 Pepis accession to the throne may have occurred in times of discord. Manetho writing nearly 2000 years after Pepis reign claims that Pepis father Teti was assassinated by his own bodyguards.852 The Egyptologist Naguib Kanawati has argued in support of Manethos claim noting for example that Tetis reign saw a significant increase in the number of guards at the Egyptian court who became responsible for the everyday care of the king.74 At the same time the figures and names of several contemporary palace officials as represented in their tombs have been erased purposefully.75 This seems to be an attempt at a damnatio memoriae76 targeting three men in particular the vizier Hezinote 11 the overseer of weapons Mereri and chief physician Seankhuiptah. These men could therefore be behind the regicide.78 Pepi may have been too young to be king. In any case he did not immediately succeed his father. King Userkare succeeded him instead but Userkares identity and relationship to the royal family remain uncertain. It is possible Userkare served only as a regent with Pepis mother Iput as Pepi reached adulthood79 occupying the throne in the interregnum until Pepis coming of age.80 The apparent lack of resistance to Pepis eventual accession supports such hypotheses.79 Against this view however Kanawati has argued that Userkares short reignlasting perhaps only one yearcannot be a regency as a regent would not have assumed a full royal titulary as Userkare did nor would he be included in king lists.74 Rather Userkare could have been an usurpernote 12 and a descendant of a lateral branch of the Fifth Dynasty royal family who seized power briefly in a coup81 possibly with the support of the priesthood of the sun god Ra.74 This hypothesis finds indirect evidence in Userkares theophoric name which incorporates the name of Ra a naming fashion common during the preceding Fifth Dynasty that had fallen out of use since Unass reign. Further archeological evidence of Userkares illegitimacy in the eyes of his successor is the absence of any mention of him in the tombs and biographies of the many Egyptian officials who served under both Teti and Pepi I.1482 For example the viziers Inumin and Khentika who served both Teti and Pepi I are completely silent about Userkare and none of their activities during his time on the throne are reported in their tomb.83 The tomb of Mehi a guard who lived under Teti Userkare and Pepi yielded an inscription showing that the name of Teti was first erased to be replaced by that of another king whose name was itself erased and replaced again by that of Teti.84 Kanawati argues the intervening name was that of Userkare to whom Mehi may have transferred his allegiance.85 Mehis attempt to switch back to Teti was seemingly unsuccessful as there is evidence that work on his tomb stopped abruptly and that he was never buried there.86 For the Egyptologist Miroslav Brta cs further troubles might have arisen directly between Pepi and relatives of his father Teti.76 Brta and Baud point to Pepis apparent decision to dismantle the funerary complex of his paternal grandmother87 Sesheshet as witnessed by blocks from this queens complex which were found reused as construction material in Pepis own mortuary temple.7688 On the other hand Wilfried Seipel disagrees with this interpretation of the blocks being reused by Pepi instead he thinks the blocks bear witness to Pepis foundation of a pious memorial to his grandmother.89 At the same time as he apparently distanced himself from his fathers line Pepi transformed his mothers tomb into a pyramid and posthumously bestowed a new title on her Daughter of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt thereby emphasising his royal lineage as a descendant of Unas last ruler of the Fifth Dynasty.76 Pepi chose the Horus name of Merytawy meaning He who is loved by the two lands or Beloved of the Two Lands which Nicolas Grimal sees as a clear indication that he desired political appeasement in times of troubles.90 Similarly Pepi chose the throne name Nefersahor meaning Perfect is the protection of Horus.9 Brta adds that Pepis writing of his own name Merytawy is also highly unusual he chose to invert the order of the hieroglyphic signs composing it placing the sign for Beloved before that for Two Lands. For Brta and Yannis Gourdon this deliberate choice shows Pepis deference to the powerful nobility of the country on which he was dependent.76 Although there seems to be no direct relation between Userkares brief reign and one or more later conspiracies against him this evidence suggests some form of political instability at the time.90 Turquoise cylinder seal of an official of Pepi I Sole companion lector priest who does what is ordered ... privy to the secrets of the king91 Provincial administrationedit In a long trend that began earlier in the Fifth Dynasty the Old Kingdom Egyptian state was the subject of increasing decentralisation and regionalisation.92 Provincial families played an increasingly important role marrying into the royal family accessing the highest offices of the state administration and having a strong influence at the court while also consolidating their hold over regional power bases by creating local dynasties.93 These processes well under way during Pepi Is reign progressively weakened the kings primacy and ascendancy over his own administration and would ultimately result in the princedoms of the First Intermediate Period.94 Teti and Pepi I seem to have developed several policies to counteract this. They both changed the organisation of the territorial administration during their reigns many provincial governors were nominated especially in Upper Egypt95 while Lower Egypt was possibly under direct royal administration.96 In addition Pepi instigated the construction of royal Kachapelsnote 13 throughout Egypt9498 to strengthen the royal presence in the provinces.99 These expensive policies suggest Egypt was prosperous during Pepis reign.51 Small provincial centres in areas historically associated with the crown became more important suggesting that pharaohs of the Sixth Dynasty tried to diminish the power of regional dynasties by recruiting senior officials who did not belong to them and were loyal to the pharaoh.100 Some of these new officials have no known background indicating they were not of noble extraction. The circulation of high officials who were moved from key positions of power to other duties occurred at an astonishing pace under Teti and Pepi I according to the Egyptologist Juan Carlos Moreno Garca93 in what might have been a deliberate attempt to curtail the concentration of power in the hands of a few officials.95 The Sixth Dynasty royal annals only a small part of which are still legible record further activities during Pepis reign including the offering of milk and young cows for a feast of Ra the building of a south chapel on the occasion of the new year and the arrival of messengers at court.101 Further offerings of lapislazuli66 cattle bread and beer are mentioned102 for gods including Horus103 and the Ennead.104 Conspiracyedit Weni shown on a lintel from his tomb with the name of Pepi Is pyramid Pepi Mennefer mentioned on the top row of hieroglyphs Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum.1
05 note 14 At some point in his reignnote 15 Pepi faced a conspiracy hatched by one of his harem consorts only known by her title WeretYamtes. Although Weni who served as a judge during the subsequent trial does not report the precise nature of her crime this at least shows that the person of the king was not untouchable.107 If the conspiracy happened early in Pepis reign as proposed by Wilfried Seipel and Vivienne Callender the queen concerned could have been Userkares mother and Tetis consort rather than Pepis.108 Most scholars however agree with Hans Goedickes thesis that the conspiracy occurred after more than two decades into Pepis reign. For Goedicke the queen could have been Merenres mother.39 Nicolas Grimalnote 16 and Baud see this as highly unlikely and outright outlandish respectively109 as this queens son would have been punished along with her.36 Rather the queen might have attempted unsuccessfully to secure the throne for her son whose name is now lost.108 Perhaps in response to these events Pepi changed his prenomen Nefersahor to Meryre meaning Beloved of Ra even updating the inscriptions inside his pyramid.note 17 This late change with Pepi incorporating the sun god Ras name into his own may reflect some agreement with the influential priesthood of Ra.110 Around this time Pepi married two daughters of Khui the provincial governor of Abydos.111 This may also have served to counteract the weakening of the kings authority over Middle and Upper Egypt by securing the allegiance of a powerful family.112 For Baud and Christopher Eyre this also demonstrates that at the time of the Sixth Dynasty government and power was still largely determined by family relationships rather than by bureaucracy.113114 The political importance of these marriages114 is furthered by the fact that for the first and last time until the 
26 th Dynasty some 1800 years later a woman Khuis wife Nebet bore the title of vizier of Upper Egypt. Egyptologists debate whether this title was purely honorific115 or whether she really assumed the duties of a vizier.75 Later Khuis and Nebets son Djau was made vizier as well. Pepis marriages might be at the origin116 of a trend which continued during the later Sixth and Eighth Dynasties in which the temple of Min in CoptosKhuis seat of powerwas the focus of much royal patronage.39 The Coptos Decrees which record successive pharaohs granting tax exemptions to the temple as well as official honours bestowed by the kings on the local ruling family while the Old Kingdom society was collapsing manifest this.117 End of reign coregencyedit The end of Pepis rule may have been no less troubled than his early reign as Kanawati conjectures that Pepi faced yet another conspiracy against him in which his vizier Rawer may have been involved. To support his theory Kanawati observes that Rawers image in his tomb has been desecrated with his name hands and feet chiselled off while this same tomb is dated to the second half of Pepis reign on stylistic grounds.118 Kanawati further posits that the conspiracy may have aimed at having someone else designated heir to the throne at the expense of Merenre. Because of this failed conspiracy Pepi I may have taken the drasticnote 18 step of crowning Merenre during his own reign58 thereby creating the earliest documented coregency in the history of Egypt.118 That such a coregency took place was first proposed by tienne Drioton. A gold pendant bearing the names of both Pepi I and Merenre I as living kings122123 and the copper statues of Hierakonpolis discussed below indirectly support this.112 Goedicke has suggested further that an inscription mentioning King Merenres tenth year of reign in Hatnub contradicting Manethos figure of seven years is evidence that Merenre dated the start of his reign before the end of his fathers reign as a coregency would permit.124 The coregency remains uncertain. The Sixth Dynasty Royal annals bear no trace either for or against it but the shape and size of the stone on which the annals are inscribed makes it more probable that Merenre did not start to count his years of reign until soon after the death of his father.1
25 note 19 Furthermore William J. Murnane writes that the gold pendants context is unknown making its significance regarding the coregency difficult to appraise. The copper statues are similarly inconclusive as the identity of the smaller one and whether they originally formed a group remains uncertain.127 Military campaignsedit Autobiography of Weni now at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo1
28 note 20 Militarily aggressive expansion into Nubia marked Pepi Is reign.129130 The walls of the tombs of the contemporary nomarchs of Elephantine129 alabaster vessels bearing Pepis cartouche found in Kerma131 and inscriptions in Tumas report this.80 The Sixth Dynasty royal annals also recount at least one campaign into Nubia. Although the campaign narrative is now largely illegible according to the Egyptologists Baud and Dobrev it comprised three phases first messengers were sent to Nubia for negotiation and surveillance purposes then the military campaign took place and finally a booty of men and goods was brought back to Egypt for presentation to the pharaoh.132 To the northeast of Egypt Pepi launched at least five military expeditions against the sand dwellersnote 21 of Sinai and southern Canaan.112134 These campaigns are recounted on the walls of the tomb of Weni then officially a palace superintendent but given tasks befitting a general.135 Weni states that he ordered nomarchs in Upper Egypt and the Nile Delta region to call up the levies of their own subordinates and these in turn summoned their subordinates down through every level of the local administration.136 Meanwhile Nubian mercenaries were also recruited and endowed with the power to enroll men and seize goods1121
37 note 22 so that in total tens of thousands of men were at Wenis disposal.135 This is the only text relating the raising of an Egyptian army during the Old Kingdom136 and it indirectly reveals the absence of a permanent standing army at the time.139 The goal of this army was either to repulse rebelling Semitic people1
40 note 23 or to seize their properties and conquer their land in southern Canaannote 24 an action possibly motivated by the intense commercial activities between Egypt and this region.145 The Egyptians campaigned up to what was probably Mount Carmel142 or Ras Kouroun146 landing troops on the coast using transport boats.112147 Weni reports that walled towns were destroyed fig trees and grape vines were cut down and local shrines were burned.148 Economyedit Eblas royal palace destroyed c.2300 BC The reign of Pepi I marks the apogee of the Sixth Dynasty foreign policy with flourishing trade several mining and quarrying expeditions and major military campaigns.149 Foreign trade and miningedit Trade with settlements along the Levantine coast which had existed during the Fifth Dynasty seems to have peaked150 under Pepi I and Pepi II. Their chief trade partner there might have been Byblos where dozens of inscriptions on stone vessels showing Pepis cartouches have been found151152 and a large alabaster vessel bearing Pepis titulary and commemorating his jubilee from the Temple of Baalat Gebal.1
53 note 25 The high official Iny served Pepi during several successful expeditions to Byblos for which the king rewarded him with the name Inydjefaw meaning He who brings back provisions.154 Through Byblos Egypt had indirect contacts155 with the city of Ebla in modernday Syria.101
56 note 26 The contact with Ebla is established by alabaster vessels157 bearing Pepis name found near its royal palace G1
58 note 27 destroyed in the 
23 rd century BC possibly by the Akkadian Empire under Sargon.160 Trading parties departed Egypt for the Levant from a Nile Delta port called RaHat the first mouth of the Nile. This trade benefited the nearby city of Mendes from which one of Pepis viziers probably originated.161 Further contacts with Canaan may be inferred from a statue of Pepi which is said to have been unearthed in Gezer but has since been lost.162 Expeditions and mining activities that were already taking place in the Fifth and early Sixth Dynasty continued unabated. These include at least one expedition of workmen and their military escort163 to the mines of turquoise and copper in Wadi Maghareh Sinai 156 around Pepis 
36 th year on the throne.
80 note 28 In all likelihood this expedition departed Egypt from the Red Sea coast port of Ayn Soukhna which was active during Pepis reign.165 The same port may also have been the origin of an expedition to the southern Red Sea possibly to Punt as witnessed by Ethiopian obsidian discovered on the site.166 There were also one or more expeditions to Hatnub where alabaster was extracted156 at least once in Pepis 
49 th year of reign80 as well as visits to the Gebel elSilsila167 and Sehel Island.168 A trading expedition fetching lapislazuli and lead or tin may also have passed further south through Mirgissa.1
69 note 29 Greywacke and siltstone for building projects originated from quarries of the Wadi Hammamat156 where some eighty graffiti mention Pepi I.171 At the same time an extensive network of caravan routes traversed Egypts Western Desert for example from Abydos to the Kharga Oasis and from there to the Dakhla and Selima Oases.156 Domestic policiesedit Agricultural estates affiliated with the crown in the provinces during the preceding dynasty were replaced by novel administrative entities the wt which were agricultural centres controlling tracts of land livestock and workers. Together with temples and royal domains these numerous wt represented a network of warehouses accessible to royal envoys and from which taxes and labor could easily be collected.172173 This territorial mode of organisation disappeared nearly 300 years after Pepi Is reign at the dawn of the Middle Kingdom period.172 Pepi decreed taxexemptions to various institutions. He gave an exemption to a chapel dedicated to the cult of his mother located in Coptos.1
74 note 30 Another decree has survived on a stele discovered near the Bent Pyramid in Dashur whereby in his 
21 st year of reign Pepi grants exemptions to the people serving in the two pyramids townsnote 31 of Sneferu175 My majesty has commanded that these two pyramid towns be exempt for him throughout the course of eternity from doing any work of the palace from doing any forced labor for any part of the royal residence throughout the course of eternity or from doing any forced labor at the word of anybody in the course of eternity.176 The Egyptologist David Warburton sees such perpetual tax exemptions as capitulations by a king confronted with rampant corruption. Whether they were the result of religious or political motives exemptions created precedents that encouraged other institutions to request similar treatment weakening the power of the state as they accumulated over time.177 Further domestic activities related to agriculture and the economy may be inferred from the inscriptions found in the tomb of Nekhebu a high official belonging to the family of Senedjemib Inti a vizier during the late Fifth Dynasty. Nekhebu reports overseeing the excavations of canals in Lower Egypt and at Cusae in Middle Egypt.178179 Building activitiesedit Ruins of Pepi Is Kachapel in Bubastis180 Pepi I built extensively throughout Egypt181 so much so that in 1900 the Egyptologist Flinders Petrie stated this king has left more monuments large and small than any other ruler before the Twelfth Dynasty.51 The Egyptologist Jean Leclant reached a similar conclusion in 1999. He sees Pepis rule as marking the apogee of the Old Kingdom owing to the flurry of building activities administrative reforms trade and military campaigns at the time.14 Pepi devoted most of his building efforts to local cults147 and royal Kachapels182 seemingly with the objective of affirming the kings stature and presence in the provinces.183 Kachapelsedit Kachapels were small cult buildings comprising one or more chambers to hold offerings dedicated to the cult of the Ka of a deceased or in this case the king.184 Such chapels dedicated to Pepi I were uncovered or are known from contemporary sources to have stood in Hierakonpolis185186 in Abydos1871
88 note 32 and in the central Nile Delta region178 in Memphis Zawyet elMeytin Assiut Qus182 and beyond the Nile Valley in Balat a settlement of the Dakhla Oasis.191 In addition two192 chapels were built in Bubastis180 and probably more than one stood in Dendera.note 33 Finally yet another chapel is believed to have existed in Elkab where rock inscriptions refer to his funerary cult.194 All these buildings were probably peripheral to or inside189 larger temples hosting extensive cult activities.195196 For example the chapel at Abydos was next to the temple of KhentiAmentiu.197 For the Egyptologist Juan Moreno Garca this proximity demonstrates the direct power that the king still held over the temples economic activities and internal affairs during the Sixth Dynasty.189 The smaller copper statue from Hierakonpolis representing Merenre or a young Pepi I1 In an underground store beneath the floor of Hierakonpolis Kachapel of Pepi the Egyptologist James Quibell uncovered a statue of King Khasekhemwy of the Second Dynasty a terracotta lion cub made during the Thinite era198 a golden mask representing Horus and two copper statues.199200 Originally fashioned by hammering plates of copper over a wooden base199201 these statues had been disassembled placed inside one another and then sealed with a thin layer of engraved copper bearing the titles and names of Pepi I on the first day of the Heb Sed feast.198 The two statues were symbolically trampling underfoot the Nine bowsthe enemies of Egypta stylized representation of Egypts conquered foreign subjects.202 While the identity of the larger adult figure as Pepi I is revealed by the inscription the identity of the smaller statue showing a younger person remains unresolved.198 The most common hypothesis among Egyptologists is that the young man shown is Merenre.186 As Alessandro Bongioanni and Maria Croce write Merenre was publicly associated as his fathers successor on the occasion of the Jubilee the Heb Sed feast. The placement of his copper effigy inside that of his father would therefore reflect the continuity of the royal succession and the passage of the royal sceptre from father to son before the death of the pharaoh could cause a dynastic split.203 Alternatively Bongioanni and Croce have also proposed the smaller statue may represent a more youthful Pepy I reinvigorated by the celebration of the Jubilee ceremonies.204 Templesedit The close association between Kachapels and temples to deities might have spurred building activities for the latter. For example the Bubastis ensemble of Pepi I comprised a 95 m  60 m 312 ft  197 ft enclosure wall with a small rectangular Kachapel housing eight pillars near its north corner.205 This ensemble was peripheral to the main Old Kingdom temple dedicated to the goddess Bastet.186 In Dendera where a fragmentary statue of a seated Pepi I has been uncovered206 Pepi restored the temple complex to the goddess Hathor.207 He seems particularly to have desired to be associated with her using the epithet son of Hathor of Dendera on numerous vessels found throughout Egypt and abroad.5159188208 In Abydos209 he built a small rock cut chapel dedicated to the local god KhentiAmentiu210 where he is again referred to as Pepi son of Hathor of Dendera.211 Pepi also referred to himself as the son of Atum of Heliopolis direct evidence for the strengthening of the Heliopolitan cults at the time.212 At the southern border of Egypt in Elephantine several faience plaques bearing Pepis cartouche213 have been uncovered in the temple of Satet. These may suggest royal interest in the local cult.116 An alabaster statue of an ape with its offspring bearing Pepi Is cartouche214 was uncovered in the same location but it was probably a gift of the king to a high official who then dedicated it to Satet.99 In this temple Pepi built a red granite naos 99 destined either to house the goddesss statue215 or a statue of Pepi I himself which would mean the naos was yet another Kachapel.216 Pepi Is cartouche and the epithet beloved of Satet is inscribed on the naos which stands 
1.3 2 m 
4.3  ft high.99 Pepi seems to have undertaken wider works in the temple possibly reorganising its layout by adding walls and an altar.217 In this context the faience tablets bearing his cartouche may be foundation offerings made at the start of the works218 although this has been contested.219 For the Egyptologist David Warburton the reigns of Pepi I and II mark the first period during which small stone temples dedicated to local deities were built in Egypt.212 Pyramid complexedit Calcitealabaster jar mentioning the cartouches of Pepi I the name of his pyramid complex and his first Sed festival Neues Museum Berlin.220 Pepi I had a pyramid complex built for himself in South Saqqara221 which he named MenneferPepi variously translated as Pepis splendour is enduring222 The perfection of Pepi is established223 The beauty of Pepi endures3 or The perfection of Pepi endures.224 The shortened name Mennefer for the pyramid complex progressively became the name of the nearby capital of Egyptwhich had originally been called Inebhedj. In particular the Egyptian Mennefer ultimately gave Memphis in Greek a name which is still in use for this ancient city.32022
24 note 34 Pepi Is mortuary complex is neighboured on its southwest corner by a necropolis built during his own reign and the reigns of Merenre and Pepi II. The necropolis housed the pyramids of Pepi Is consorts and their dedicated funerary temples.
22 note 35 Main pyramidedit Main article Pyramid of Pepi I Pepis main pyramid was constructed in the same fashion as royal pyramids since the reign of Djedkare Isesi some 80 years earlier226 a core built six steps high from small roughly dressed blocks of limestone bound together using clay mortar encased with fine limestone blocks.227 The pyramid now destroyed had a base length of 
78.7 5 m 258 ft 150 cu converging to the apex at  53 and once stood 
52.5  m 172 ft 100 cu tall.223 Its remains now form a meager mound of 12 m 39 ft 23 cu221222 containing a pit in its centre dug by stone thieves.228 The substructure of the pyramid was accessed from the north chapel which has since disappeared. From the entrance a descending corridor gives way to a vestibule leading into the horizontal passage. Halfway along the passage three granite portcullises guard the chambers. As in preceding pyramids the substructure contains three chambers an antechamber on the pyramids vertical axis a serdab with three recesses to its east and a burial chamber containing the kings sarcophagus to the west.229 Extraordinarily the pink granite canopic chest that is sunk into the floor at the foot of the sarcophagus has remained undisturbed.223230 Discovered alongside it was a bundle of viscera presumed to belong to the pharaoh.230 The provenance of a mummy fragment and fine linen wrappings discovered in the burial chamber are unknown but they are hypothesized to belong to Pepi I.231 The walls of Pepi Is antechamber burial chamber and much of the corridornote 36 are covered with vertical columns of inscribed hieroglyphic text.223231235 The hieroglyphs are painted green with ground malachite and gum arabic a colour symbolising renewal.236 His sarcophagus is also inscribed on its east side with the kings titles and names as part of a larger set of spells that includes texts at the bottom of the north and south walls opposite the sarcophagus and in a line running across the top of the north west and south walls of the chamber.237 The writing comprises 2263 columns and lines of text from 651 spells of which 82 are unique to Pepis pyramid.238 This is the most extensive corpus of Pyramid Texts from the Old Kingdom.239 The tradition of inscribing texts inside the pyramid was begun by Unas at the end of the Fifth Dynasty3240241 but originally discovered in Pepi Is pyramid in 18
80.2 23242 Their function like that of all funerary literature was to enable the reunion of the rulers ba and Ka leading to the transformation into an akh243244 and to secure eternal life among the gods in the sky.245246247 Mortuary templeedit Fragments of the pyramid texts from Pepi Is pyramid in South Saqqara now in the Petrie Museum2482
49 note 37 Pepis pyramid was part of a wider funerary complex comprising a small cult pyramid and mortuary temple surrounded by an enclosure wall. The purpose of the cult pyramid remains unclear. While it had a burial chamber it was never used as such and must have been a purely symbolic structure.250 It may have hosted the pharaohs Ka251 or a miniature statue of the king252 and could have been used for ritual performances centring around the burial and resurrection of the Ka spirit during the Sed festival.252 Excavations of the small cult pyramid yielded statue fragments pieces of stelae and offering tables which indicate the continuation of Pepis funerary cult into the Middle Kingdom.223 A valley temple by the Nile and a causeway leading from this temple up to the pyramid on the desert plateau completed the overall construction.223 The high temple next to the pyramid was laid out according to a standard plan253 making it nearly the same as the temples of Djedkare Isesi Unas and Teti.230 The temple had an entrance hall some 
6.2 9 m 
20.6  ft high now almost completely destroyed leading into an open columned courtyard. Storage rooms to the north and south flanked the hall. The inner temple contained a chapel with five statue niches an offering hall and other core chambers.254 Either the mortuary temple or the causeway might have been lined with statues of kneeling bound captives255 representing Egypts traditional enemies.223 Both the temple and the causeway are now heavily damaged due the activity of lime makers who extracted and burned the construction stones to turn them into mortar and whitewash in later times. In particular the original location of the statues remains uncertain as they had been displaced ready to be thrown into a lime furnace.223254 Necropolis of Pepi Iedit Pepis mortuary complex was the centre of a wider necropolis which comprised the tombs of the royal family and further afield those of the high officials of the state administration including a tomb for Weni.256 Pepi had pyramids built for his consorts to the south and southwest of his pyramid. These were all located outside the complex enclosure wall but inside an area delimited by a street to the west. Three of the main queens pyramids were built in a row on an eastwest axis each with a base side dimension of about 20 m 66 ft.33 The Ancient Egyptians referred to the owners of these pyramids as the Queen of the East Queen of the Centre and Queen of the West.33 Layout of the necropolis of Pepi I22 Pyramid of Nebwenetedit The pyramid of the queen of the east belonged to Nebwenet whose name image and titles are preserved on a fallen jamb uncovered in the attached mortuary temple.33 The pyramid had a base of 
26.2  m 86 ft making it similar in size to the other pyramids of the necropolis. On its northern face was a small mudbrick chapel which hosted a limestone altar now broken. The pyramids substructures were accessed from a descending passageway leading first to an antechamber and from there to the burial chamber slightly to the south of the pyramids apex. This chamber yielded fragments of pink granite sarcophagus and pieces of inscribed alabaster. To the east was a serdab and the scant remnants of funerary equipment.22 Pyramid of InenekIntiedit Immediately west of the pyramid of the queen of the east was the pyramid of the queen of the centre InenekInti. The name image and titles of this queen are inscribed on jambs and two 
2.2  m 
7.2  ft high redpainted obelisks on either side of the gateway to the mortuary temple establishing that InenekInti was buried there.257 With a base of 
22.5 3 m 
73.9  ft the pyramid size and layout is similar to that of Nebwenet except that the burial chamber is located precisely beneath the pyramid apex. Fragments of a greywacke sarcophagus and pieces of stone vessels were uncovered there. Unlike Ankhesenpepi IIs burial chamber that of InenekInti had no inscriptions on its walls. Ineneks mortuary temple was much larger than Nebwenets surrounding her pyramid on its eastern northern and southern sides. Ineneks complex also comprised a small cult pyramid 
6.3  m 21 ft at the base on the southeast corner of the mortuary temple.258 Queen of the Westedit West of Ineneks pyramid is that of the queen of the west. The identity of this pyramids owner is preserved on an obelisk in front of her pyramid only as the eldest daughter of the king.259 The pyramid had a base length of around 20 m 66 ft33 similar to those of Inenek and Nebwenet and now stands 3 m 
9.8  ft tall.260 Entry into the substructure is gained on the north face.261 The burial chamber is located under the vertical axis of the pyramid.260 The location of the serdab is unusual being to the south of the burial chamber instead of east.260261262 Substantial remains of funerary equipment were found inside including wooden weights ostrich feathers copper fish hooks and firedclay vessels260 but none bore their owners name.263 It has a hastily built mortuary temple with an offering hall and a room with two statue niches. Relief fragments discovered depict scenes of processions and estates along with an incomplete cartouche of Pepi Is name.260 Pyramid of Ankhesenpepi IIedit View of the pyramids and temples of Ankhesenpepi II and III in the necropolis of Pepi I The pyramid of Ankhesenpepi II occupies the southwestern extremity of the necropolis of Pepi I.264 With a base of 
31.4  m 103 ft the pyramid once reached 30 m 98 ft high making it the largest of the queens pyramids.265 The funerary complex of Ankhesenpepi II was also the largest in the necropolis except for that of Pepi himself covering an area of 3500 m2 38000 sq ft.265 It comprised a mortuary temple to the north of the pyramid and 20 storage rooms for offerings. The queens funerary complex had a monumental entrance with a granite frame its lintel bearing the queens name and titles being more than 
3.6  m 12 ft wide and weighing over 17 tons.266 A small chapel stood on the pyramid northern face at the entrance of the substructures. Painted reliefs of which only scant remains have been found including a small scene depicting the queen and a princess on a boat among papyrus plants adorned the accompanying funerary temple.265 The burial chamber walls were inscribed with spells from the pyramid texts a privilege that had been the preserve of kings. Fragments from a black basalt sarcophagus were uncovered onsite.41 Pyramid of Behenuedit With a base of 
26.2  m 86 ft Queen Behenus pyramid was of similar size and layout to the other queens pyramids of the necropolis. Located on the western end of the necropolis immediately northwest of Mehaas tomb on which it intrudes Behenus mortuary temple was on the pyramids southern face with a cult pyramid on its southeast corner. The entrance of the temple flanked with two granite obelisks led to several rooms which once housed statues and offering altars while a further 10 rooms served for storage.22 The burial chamber measured 
6.2 4 m  
2.8 8 m 
20.5  ft  
9.4  ft267 and its walls were inscribed with numerous spells of the pyramid texts. The head of a wooden statue of the queen as well as her opened basalt sarcophagus were unearthed there.268 Pyramid of Mehaaedit Pepis consort Mehaa was buried in a pyramid on the southwest corner of Pepis enclosure wall.261262 Directly adjacent to Mehaas pyramids eastern face was her mortuary temple where a relief bearing the name and image of Prince Hornetjerykhet her son was uncovered.262 Mehaas pyramid is intruded upon by the pyramid of Behenu establishing that Mehaa was a consort of Pepi I early in his reign while Behenu lived in the later part of his rule.269 Legacyedit Steatite cylinder seal belonging to a land tenant serving in Pepis pyramid complex270 Old Kingdomedit Pepi I was the object of a funerary cult after his death. For the remainder of the Old Kingdom period the funerary cult of Pepi had active priests even outside of his Saqqara mortuary complex for example inscriptions in Elkab attest to the presence of priests of his cult officiating in or in the vicinity of the local temple of Nekhbet.194 The ritual activities taking place in his main funerary complex continued up until the Middle Kingdom. This means that Pepis cult continued to be celebrated during the First Intermediate Period271 a period during which the Egyptian state seems to have collapsed with only brief interruptions of the cultic activities at times of important political instability.272 As members of the royal family and high officials had continued to be buried in the necropolis next to Pepis pyramid during the reigns of Merenre and Pepi II including Ankhesenpepi II and III and Pepis daughter Meritites273 Pepis necropolis had grown and had attracted burials from the highest officials such as vizier Weni.272 Starting with the reign of Pepi II the necropolis also attracted burials from private individuals274 as well as popular devotion to him and his consorts.275 The deposit of numerous offering tables throughout the site confirms this.274 Middle Kingdomedit The conquest of Egypt under Mentuhotep II seems to have interrupted all activities in the necropolis.276 These resumed towards the end of the Eleventh Dynasty when the statesponsored funerary cult of Pepi was renewed277 albeit in a more limited form than earlier.278 At this time private cultic activities seem to cease in the wider necropolis of Pepi rather concentrating in Pepis own mortuary temple mainly around his statues then accessible to important officials participating in the pharaohs cult.279280 Meanwhile the abandonment of certain parts of the mortuary temple and the queens necropolis led to the installation of novel tombs.279 The most prominent of these was that of the high official Reheryshefnakht who had a small pyramid complex built for himself in the midst of the tombs of the Sixth Dynasty royal family.273 The royal cult of Pepi I seems to have ended with the onset of the Second Intermediate Period.279 New Kingdomedit Head of Khaemweset Altes Museum The New Kingdom period witnessed renewed private burials in the necropolis of Pepi including in several rooms of his mortuary temple which were used as a catacomb at the time281 although no such tomb was found in the main room hosting the royal funerary cult suggesting continued use.281 The individuals buried in the necropolis belonged to the lower ranks of Egyptian society as shown by the simplicity if not the absence of funerary equipment282 while those using the catacombs were richer.281 The consequences of the longlasting cults of Old Kingdom pharaohs during the New Kingdom are apparent in the Karnak king list. It was composed during the reign of Thutmosis III to honour a selection of royal ancestors. Several pharaohs of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasty including Nyuserre Ini Djedkare Isesi Teti and Pepi I are mentioned on the list by their birth name rather than throne name. The Egyptologist Antonio Morales believes this is because the popular cults for these kings which existed well into the New Kingdom referred to these kings using their birth name.283 Later during the reign of Ramses II limited restoration works on the Old Kingdom monuments took place in the Memphite area under the direction of Prince Khaemweset. Pepis pyramid complex was among those restored as shown by inscriptions left onsite by Khaemweset284 even though it was actively being used for private burials.281 Pepi Is necropolis was therefore probably in a ruined state at this point with the area with the queens pyramids serving as a stone quarry.282 Khaemweset stated he had found the pyramid abandoned and recalled his proprietor for posterity.285 The progressive accumulation of burials in the passages leading up to the temple cult rooms blocked all access to it demonstrating that Pepis funerary cult had ceased.281 Late Periodedit The stone quarrying activities which were limited to Pepis necropolis during the New Kingdom and had spared his mortuary temple became widespread during the Late Period of Egypt with intermittent burials continuing nonetheless.286 Both the stone robbing and funerary activities stopped at some point during the period and the necropolis was abandoned until the Mamluk period when intense stone quarrying resumed.287 Notesedit  Dates proposed for Pepi Is reign 23902361 BC2 23542310 BC34 23382298 BC5 23352285 BC6 23322283 BC7 23212287 BC8910 22892255 BC11 22852235 BC6 22762228 BC.12  Among her titles Iput bore the titles of kings mother mwtniswt mother of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt mwtniswtbiti and kings mother of the pyramid MenneferPepy mwtniswtmnnfrppy.18  Their names are also rendered as Ankhnespepy I and II. In addition the Ancient Egyptians also used the variants Ankhesenmeryre I and II.2324  In an alternative hypothesis Hans Goedicke has proposed that Merenres mother was the consort known only from her title WeretYamtes responsible for the harem conspiracy against Pepi I. In this widely rejected hypothesis Ankhesenpepi I was falsely claimed by the Ancient Egyptians to be Merenres mother to safeguard his claim to the throne.39  Meritites has also been proposed to be one of Pepi Is consorts rather than daughter43 or an Eighth Dynasty queen buried here to indicate her filiation to Pepi I.43 Both views were proved wrong following excavations in Saqqara indicating she was Pepis daughter.44  Vivienne Callendar proposed her as Pepis eldest daughter46 but excavations have now established that Meritites was the kings eldest daughter.44  In the case of Pepi I the evolution of the name from Ancient Egyptian to Ancient Greek is understood to be as follows Pjpj  Pypy  Pypy  Py py  Py p  .53  There has been some doubt whether the cattle count dating system was strictly biennial or slightly more irregular early in the Sixth Dynasty. That the latter situation appeared to be the case was suggested by the Year after the 
18 th Count 
3 rd Month of Shemu day 27 inscription from Wadi Hammamat No. 7475 which mentions the first occurrence of the Heb Sed in that year for Pepi. Normally the Sed festival is first celebrated in a kings 
30 th year of reign while the 
18 th cattle count would have taken place in his 
36 th year had it been strictly biennial.61 The Egyptologist Michel Baud points to a similar inscription dated to Year after the 
18 th Count 
4 th Month of Shemu day 5 in Sinai graffito No. 1
06.6 2 This could imply that the cattle count during the Sixth Dynasty was not regularly biennial or that it was referenced continuously in the years following it. Michel Baud stresses that the year of the 
18 th count is preserved in the South Saqqara Stone and writes that Between the mention of count 18 here and the next memorial formula which belongs to count 19 end of register D the available space for count 18 is the expected half of the average size of a theoretical year count compartment. It is hard to believe that such a narrow space corresponds to the jubilee celebration which obviously had a considerable importance for this and every king.63 Therefore the references to Pepi Is first jubilee being celebrated in his 
18 th cattle count are probably just part of this royal tendency to emphasize the kings first jubilee years after it was first celebrated and Baud notes that the longest year compartment in the South Saqqara Stone appears at the beginning of register D. Fortuitously or not this year compartment corresponds perfectly to year 3031 if a strictly biennial system of numbering is presumed for Pepi Is reign. i.e. his 
15 th count Therefore the count was most probably biennial during Pepi Is reign and the reference to his final yearthe 25 countimplies that he reigned for 49 full years.63  The Turin King List gives only 20 years on the throne to Pepi I while his successor Merenre I is said to have reigned 44 years. This latter figure contradicts both contemporaneous and archaeological evidence. For example the royal annals mention no further cattle count under Merenre I beyond his fifth which might correspond to his tenth year of rule. The Egyptologist Kim Ryholt suggests that the two entries of the Turin king list might have been interchanged.68  Catalog number

At the death of the person the Ka simply departed the body but continued to exist and had to be sustained through offerings performed in the Kachapel associated with the tomb.97  Catalog number RC17
71.1 05  The precise date when Pepi faced the harem conspiracy is debated. Darrell Baker proposed that this happened early in his rule51 while Hans Goedicke proposes Pepis 
21 st year of reign as the terminus post quem for this conspiracy106 positing that the most probable date is Pepis 
44 th year on the throne.39  Hans Goedicke and Nicolas Grimal both use WeretYamtes as a proper name rather than a title36 but this is strongly opposed by others including Michel Baud.109  At this point the Ancient Egyptian royal titulary assumed its definitive standard form.76  The drastic nature of Pepis decisionif there was a coregencyis apparent on noting the Ancient Egyptians conception of the kingship as rulership by a single individual holding a supreme office in a lifelong tenure most often succeeding on a hereditary principle and wielding ... great personal power.119 The emphasis on a single individual holder follows from the Ancient Egyptians perception of the king as a divine being offspring of Ra who upholds Egypts unity and prosperity as well as the cosmic order preordained by the gods and playing the crucial role of mediator between the people and the gods with the capacity of conveying the gods messages and will.120 The king not only had these unique roles but the institution of kingship was perceived as a divinely established order guarding Egypt against chaos.121120  The royal annals mention the feast of the union of the two lands concerning Merenre a feast normally celebrated once shortly after the death of a king with the start of his successors reign. Since it is very unlikely that this feast was celebrated twice for Merenre that is once at the start of the coregency and once more at the death of his father Baud and Dobrev deem it likely that the feast happened only once at Pepis death as would be normal and hence everything written on the annals after the mention of the feast must have recorded Merenres sole reign had there been a coregency prior to that point or not. While almost all the inscriptions pertaining to Merenres sole reign are now illegible the space available for them on the royal annals shows that he may have been sole king for 11 to 14 years. This can be known because every occasion of a cattle count was written in a devoted and welldelimited case in the annals and these cases are of roughly consistent sizes allowing a good estimation of the maximum number of illegible cases. That Merenre reigned over a decade as sole king cannot easily be reconciled with Manethos claim that he reigned only seven years by invoking seven years of sole reign plus an additional number of years as coregent as proponents of the coregency including Goedicke had done.126  Catalog number CGC 1435128  Transliteration from Ancient Egyptian ryw.133  The Dashur decree of Pepi I shows that such mercenaries were already pacified137 integrated into Egyptian society for example in pyramid towns where they served as policemen and soldiers.138  Transliteration from Ancient Egyptian

As Hathor was the chief deity of Byblos it is probable that this vessel was destined to this city and was only later exchanged or given to Ebla.159  More precisely the expedition is dated to Pepis 
18 th cattle count fifth day of the fourth month of Shemu which might correspond to his 
36 th year of reign some time between the July 26 and August 4 of that year.164  The geographical destination of this expedition mentioned on the funerary texts of an Egyptian official is uncertain. It may instead have taken place in the Levant.170  The decree recording this called a Coptos Decree in modern Egyptology is now in the Egyptian Museum Cairo catalog number 418
90.1 74  Pyramid towns are areas of accommodation for workers who build pyramids and all craftsmen needed to sustain the construction effort including bakers carpenters water carriers and more. These towns continued to be used after the end of the pyramid construction.  A chapel in Akhmim attributed to a king Pepi189 might belong to Pepi II.190  Pepi might have built more than one chapel there as he seems to have been particularly interested in the cult of Hathor of Dendera192 presenting himself as the son of Hathor of Dendera in numerous inscriptions including on vessels traded abroad.1885159193  The linguistic evolution from the name of Pepis pyramid to the Greek word Memphis is well understood in modern Egyptology and reconstructed as Mnnfr  M nnfr  M mf    Mnnfrw Mnn frw  Mnn fr     .225  The tombs of Meritites and Ankhesenpepi III both built after Pepis reign and tombs from later periods of Egyptian history in the necropolis are not discussed here.22  The corridor texts in Pepi Is pyramid are the most extensive covering the whole horizontal passage the vestibule and even a section of the descending corridor.232233 Unas pyramid constrained the texts to the south section of the corridor234 as did Tetis.232 The texts in Merenre Is and Pepi IIs pyramids covered the entire corridor and the vestibule.232  Catalog number UC145
