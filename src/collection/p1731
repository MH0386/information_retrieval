Josiah Josiah from Guillaume Rouills Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum 1553 King of Judah Reign 640609 BCE Predecessor Amon Successor Jehoahaz Born c.648 BCE probably Jerusalem Died Tammuz JulyAugust 609 BCE aged 3839 Jerusalem Spouse Zebudah Hamutal Issue Johanan Jehoiakim Zedekiah Jehoahaz House House of David Father Amon Mother Jedidah Josiah dosa.12 or Yoshiyahua was the 
16 th King of Judah c.640609 BCE. According to the Hebrew Bible he instituted major religious reforms by removing official worship of gods other than Yahweh. Until the 19
90 s the biblical description of Josiahs reforms were usually considered to be more or less accurate but that is now heavily debated.3 According to the Bible Josiah became king of the Kingdom of Judah at the age of eight after the assassination of his father King Amon and reigned for 31 years from 641640 to 610609 BCE.4 Josiah is known only from biblical texts no reference to him exists in other surviving texts of the period from Egypt or Babylon and no clear archaeological evidence such as inscriptions bearing his name has ever been found.5 However a seal bearing the name Nathanmelech the name of an administrative official under King Josiah according to 2 Kings 2311 dating to the 
7 th century BCE was found in situ in an archeological site in Jerusalem. The discoverers believe this seal represents the individual mentioned in 2 Kings 23
11.6  Additionally most scholars believe that Josiah existed historically and that the absence of documents is due to few documents of any sort surviving from this period and to Jerusalem having been occupied conquered and rebuilt over thousands of years.7 Biblical narrativeedit The Bible describes him as a righteous king a king who walked in all the way of David his father and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left 2 Kings 222 2 Chronicles 342. He is also one of the kings mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus in Matthews gospel one of the two genealogies of Jesus in the New Testament cf. Matthew 11011. Familyedit According to the biblical narrative Josiah was the son of King Amon and Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.8 His grandfather Manasseh was one of the kings blamed for turning away from the worship of Yahweh. Manasseh adapted the Temple for idolatrous worship. Josiahs greatgrandfather was King Hezekiah a noted reformer also respected by the biblical writers as having done what was right in the sight of the LORD as David had done.9 Josiah had four sons Johanan and Eliakim born c. 634 BCE whose mother was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah and Shallum 633632 BCE and Mattanyahu c. 618 BCE whose mother was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.10 Eliakim had his name changed by Pharaoh Necho of Egypt to Jehoiakim.11 His third son Shallum succeeded Josiah as king of Judah under the name Jehoahaz.12 Shallum was succeeded by Eliakim under the name Jehoiakim13 who was succeeded by his own son Jeconiah14 then Jeconiah was succeeded to the throne by his uncle Mattanyahu under the name Zedekiah.15 Zedekiah was the last king of Judah before the kingdom was conquered by Babylon and the people exiled. Religious reformedit The Second Book of Chronicles records that Josiah was eight years old when he became king. In the eighth year of his reign he began to seek the God of his father David and in the twelfth year of that reign he began a program of destruction of Baalist altars and images throughout Jerusalem and Judah.16 The Chronicler records in detail the execution of this program whereas the account in 2 Kings begins with the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem which both accounts say was initiated in the eighteenth year of his reign.17 View of the inner court and House of the Temple of Solomon as depicted in a 
3 D computer model Josiah ordered the High Priest Hilkiah to use the tax money which had been collected over the years to renovate the temple. While Hilkiah was clearing the treasure room of the Temple he discovered a scroll described in 2 Kings as the book of the Law18 and in 2 Chronicles as the book of the Law of the LORD given by Moses.19 The phrase sefer hatorah   in 2 Kings 228 is identical to the phrase used in Joshua 18 and 834 to describe the sacred writings that Joshua had received from Moses. The book is not identified in the text as the Torah and many scholars believe this was either a copy of the Book of Deuteronomy or a text that became a part of Deuteronomy.20 However it has been noted that the story of the repairs to the Temple is based on those ordered by an earlier Judean king Joash who ruled c. 836  796 BCE in 2 Kings 
12.2 1 Hilkiah brought this scroll to Josiahs attention. Josiah consulted the prophetess Huldah who assured him that the evil foretold in the document for nonobservance of its instructions would come but not in his day because she said thine heart was tender and thou didst humble thyself before the Lord.8 An assembly of the elders of Judah and Jerusalem and of all the people was called and Josiah then encouraged the exclusive worship of Yahweh forbidding all other forms of worship. The instruments and emblems of the worship of Baal and the host of heaven were removed from the Jerusalem Temple. Local sanctuaries or High Places were destroyed from Beersheba in the south to Bethel and the cities of Samaria in the north.8 Josiah had pagan priests executed and even had the bones of the dead priests of Bethel exhumed from their graves and burned on their altars. Josiah also reinstituted the Passover celebrations. View of the Temple of Solomon with ceiling removed as depicted in a 
3 D computer model According to 1 Kings 1313 an unnamed man of God sometimes identified as Iddo had prophesied to King Jeroboam of the northern Kingdom of Israel Samaria approximately three hundred years earlier that a son named Josiah will be born to the house of David and that he would destroy the altar at Bethel. And the only exception to this destruction was for the grave of an unnamed prophet he found in Bethel 2 Kings 231519 who had foretold that these religious sites Jeroboam erected would one day be destroyed see 1 Kings 13. Josiah ordered the double grave of the man of God and of the Bethel prophet to be left alone as these prophecies had come true. Josiahs reforms are described in two biblical accounts 2 Kings 2223 and 2 Chronicles 3435. They began with the ending of ancient Israelite religious practices and the astral cults that had become popular in the 
8 th century and led to centralisation of worship in Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple at Bethel.22 Some scholars have rejected the entire historicity of these accounts232425 while others have defended the historical existence of a religious reform under Josiahs reign.26272829 According to the later account in 2 Chronicles Josiah destroyed altars and images of pagan deities in cities of the tribes of Manasseh Ephraim and Simeon as far as Naphtali 2 Chronicles 3467 which were outside of his kingdom Judah and returned the Ark of the Covenant to the Temple.30 Book of the Lawedit Josiah Hearing the Book of the Law 1873 The Hebrew Bible states that the priest Hilkiah found a Book of the Law in the temple during the early stages of Josiahs temple renovation.313233 Hilkiah then gave the scroll to his secretary Shaphan who took it to King Josiah. According to the Bible King Josiah then changed his form of leadership entirely entering into a new form of covenant with the Lord. He wiped out all of the pagan cults that had formed within his land. He along with his people then entered into this new covenant with the Lord to keep the commandments of the Lord.34 For much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries it was agreed among biblical scholars that this Book of the Law was an early version of the Book of Deuteronomy but recent biblical scholarship sees it as a largely legendary narrative about one of the earliest stages of the creation of Deuteronomistic work.35 William G. Dever for example argues that the Book of the Law was actually composed by orthodox Yahwist priests who attributed it to the legendary figure of Moses and then hid it in the Temple where it would be dramatically discovered in this way a miraculous new Word from Yahweh would seem to have appeared giving Judah a chance to redeem itself and save itself from the advance of the NeoBabylonian Empire.36 Many scholars see the whole core narrative from Joshua to 2 Kings as comprising a Deuteronomistic History DtrH written during Josiahs reign.3738 In fact some recent European theologians even go so far as to posit that most of the Torah and Deuteronomistic History was composed and finalized several centuries later during the Persian period.39 However most biblical scholars are coming to believe that the Deuteronomistic History was composed using other earlier sources including a brief chronicle of kings names age at the beginning of their reign and their mothers names.40 Prophets and King Josiahedit According to rabbinic interpretation Huldah said to the messengers of King Josiah Tell the man that sent you to me ... 2 Kings 2215 indicating by her unceremonious language that for her Josiah was like any other man. The king addressed her and not Jeremiah because he thought that women are more easily stirred to pity than men and that therefore the prophetess would be more likely than Jeremiah to intercede with God in his behalf.41 Huldah was a relative of Jeremiah both being descendants of Rahab by her marriage with Joshua.42 While Jeremiah admonished and preached repentance to the men she did the same to the women.43 Huldah was not only a prophetess but taught publicly in the school44 according to some teaching especially the oral doctrine. It is doubtful whether the Gate of Huldah in the Second Temple Middot 13 has any connection with the prophetess Huldah it may have meant Cats Gate some scholars however associate the gate with Huldahs schoolhouse Rashi to Kings l.c..E. C. L. G. The prophetic activity of Jeremiah began in the reign of Josiah he was a contemporary of his relative the prophetess Hulda and of his teacher Zephaniah.45 These three prophets divided their activity Hulda spoke to the women and Jeremiah to the men in the street while Zephaniah preached in the synagogue.46 When Josiah restored the true worship Jeremiah went to the exiled ten tribes whom he brought to Israel under the rule of the pious king.47 Although Josiah went to war with Egypt against the prophets advice Jeremiah knew that this was an error by the otherwise pious king48 and later he bitterly laments the kings death the fourth chapter of Lamentations beginning with a dirge on Josiah.49 King Josiah who foresaw the impending national catastrophe concealed the Ark and its contents including Aarons rod the vial of manna and the anointing oil within a hidden chamber which had been built by King Solomon50 Tosefta Sotah

5 b and their whereabouts will remain unknown until in the Messianic age the prophet Elijah shall reveal them Mekhilta l.c..51 Foreign relationsedit Pharaoh Necho II When Josiah became king of Judah in about 641640 BCE the international situation was in flux. The Assyrian Empire was beginning to disintegrate the NeoBabylonian Empire had not yet risen to replace it and Egypt to the west was still recovering from Assyrian rule. In this power vacuum Jerusalem was able to govern itself for the time being without foreign intervention. In the spring of 609 BCE Pharaoh Necho II led a sizable army up to the Euphrates River to aid the NeoAssyrian Empire which was collapsing under the attacks of the Medes and the NeoBabylonian Empire.52 Taking the coast route Via Maris into Syria at the head of a large army consisting mainly of mercenaries and supported by his Mediterranean fleet along the shore Necho passed the low tracts of Philistia and Sharon. However the passage over the ridge of hills which shuts in on the south of the great Jezreel Valley was blocked by the Judean army led by Josiah. The reason for Josiah attempting to halt the Egyptian campaign is not known but he may have considered that the Assyrians and Egyptians were weakened by the death of pharaoh Psamtik I only a year earlier 610 BCE Psamtik having been appointed and confirmed by Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal.52 According to the Biblical Books of Chronicles Necho had not intended to do battle with the Judeans and was confused by Josiahs decision to attack him supposedly sending a letter saying what have we done to each other king of Judah I am not coming against you this day.53 Josiah attempted to block the advance at Megiddo where a fierce battle was fought and Josiah was killed.54 Necho then joined forces with the Assyrian Ashuruballit II and crossed the Euphrates to lay siege to Harran. The combined forces failed to capture the city and Necho retreated to northern Syria. Deathedit Death of king Josiah as illustrated by Francesco Conti There are two accounts of Josiahs death in the Bible. The Second Book of Kings merely states that Necho II met Josiah at Megiddo and killed him 2 Kings 2329 whereas the second book of Chronicles 2 Chronicles 352027 gives a lengthier account and states that Josiah was fatally wounded by Egyptian archers and was brought back to Jerusalem to die. His death in the latter account was attributed to him not listening to what Necho had said at Gods command... when Necho stated What have I to do with you king of Judah I am not coming against you today but against the house with which I am at war and God has commanded me to hurry. Cease opposing God who is with me so that he will not destroy you.55 According to 2 Chronicles 3525 Jeremiah wrote a lament for Josiahs death.56 The account in Chronicles is considered unreliable by some scholars57 as it is based on the description of the death of a different king Ahab in 1 Kings and it meets the Chroniclers religious agenda to attribute the death of a righteous king to some form of sin.58 Some researchers have concluded from the account in Kings that Josiah did not meet Necho in battle but was summoned by Necho as a vassal investigated and beheaded for failing to pay the correct tribute or tax to Egypt.59 Rabbinic Literature remarks on Josiahs piety and his father Amon The fact that Amon was the most sinful of all the wicked kings of Judah II Chron. xxxiii. 23 is brought out in the Talmud Sanh. 1
03 b as followsSanh. 1
04 a Ahaz suspended the sacrificial worship Manasseh tore down the altar Amon made it a place of desolation covered it with cobwebs Ahaz sealed up the scrolls of the Law Isa. viii. 16 Manasseh cut out the sacred name Amon burnt the scrolls altogether compare Seder Olam R. xxiv. This is derived from the story of the finding of the Book of the Law II Kings xxii. 8 Ahab permitted incest Manasseh committed it himself Amon acted as Nero was said to have done toward his mother Agrippina. And yet out of respect for his son Josiah Amons name was not placed on the list of the kings excluded from the world to come.5160 also that Josiahs death was brought about because despite his sincere religious reform he had in fact been deceived thus he refused to heed the Prophet Jeremiah thinking that no sword would pass through the Land of Israel. He was struck by 300 darts he made no complaint except to acknowledge The Lord is righteous for I rebelled against His commandment.60 Successionedit After the setback in Harran the Pharaoh Necho left a sizeable force behind and returned to Egypt. On his return march Necho found that Jehoahaz had succeeded his father Josiah. 2 Kings 2331 Necho deposed Jehoahaz who had been king for only three months and replaced him with his older brother Jehoiakim. Necho imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver about 3 34 tons or about 
3.4  metric tons and a talent of gold about 75 pounds or about 34 kilograms. Necho then took Jehoahaz back to Egypt as his prisoner. The defeat of Josiah at Megiddo essentially represents the end of the rule of the Davidic line since not only were Josiahs successors shortlived but also Judahs relative independence had crumbled in the face of a resurgent Egypt bent on regaining its traditional control of the region and the imminent rise of the Babylonian empire which also sought control. Necho had left Egypt in 609 BCE to relieve the Assyrian Harran under Babylonian siege. Josiahs actions may have provided aid to the Babylonians by engaging the Egyptian army.61 Sourcesedit A sketch of the Temple of Solomon based on descriptions in the Tanakh. The only textual sources of information for Josiahs reign are from the Bible5 notably 2 Kings 2223 and 2 Chronicles 3435. No archaeological evidence for Josiah as a person exists. However a signet ring has been found in the City of David in Jerusalem featuring the name of one of King Josiahs officials Nathanmelech mentioned in 2 Kings 2311. The inscription of the ring says belonging to NathanMelech Servant of the King.6 Although it may not directly mention King Josiah by name it does appear to be from the same time period in which he would have lived. Seals and seal impressions from the period show a transition from those of an earlier period which bear images of stars and the moon to seals that carry only names a possible indication of Josiahs enforcement of monotheism.62 No other archaeological evidence of Josiahs religious reforms has been discovered62 with a possible exception being at Tel Dothan.29 The date of Josiahs death can be established fairly accurately. The Babylonian Chronicles date the battle at Harran between the Assyrians and their Egyptian allies against the Babylonians from Tammuz JulyAugust to Elul AugustSeptember 609 BCE. On that basis Josiah was killed in the month of Tammuz JulyAugust 609 BCE when the Egyptians were on their way to Harran.63 See alsoedit List of artifacts in biblical archaeology Notesedit  Hebrew  Modern Yyah Tiberian Yyyh literally meaning healed by Yah or supported of Yah Greek  Latin Iosias Referencesedit  Wells John C. 1990.

We have no direct evidence outside the biblical text which makes us at least ask whether it is an invention of the Deuteronomist. The alleged absence of any reference to this reform in Jeremiah has always been a major puzzle. Some have found allusions here and there but one has to admit that they are surprisingly obscure. Considering Jeremiahs overall message and position he should have embraced such a reform and made copious comments about it.  Naaman Nadav 2011.
