Cleopatra fatherloving goddessnote 6 7069 BC  10 August 30 BC was Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 51 to 30 BC and its last active ruler.note 7 A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty she was a descendant of its founder Ptolemy I Soter a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great.note 8 After the death of Cleopatra Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire marking the end of the last Hellenisticperiod state in the Mediterranean and of the age that had lasted since the reign of Alexander 336323 BC.note 9 Her first language was Koine Greek and she was the only known Ptolemaic ruler to learn the Egyptian language.note 10 In 58 BC Cleopatra presumably accompanied her father Ptolemy XII Auletes during his exile to Rome after a revolt in Egypt a Roman client state allowed his rival daughter Berenice IV to claim his throne. Berenice was killed in 55 BC when Ptolemy returned to Egypt with Roman military assistance. When he died in 51 BC the joint reign of Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIII began but a fallingout between them led to an open civil war. After losing the 48 BC Battle of Pharsalus in Greece against his rival Julius Caesar a Roman dictator and consul in Caesars civil war the Roman statesman Pompey fled to Egypt. Pompey had been a political ally of Ptolemy XII but Ptolemy XIII at the urging of his court eunuchs had Pompey ambushed and killed before Caesar arrived and occupied Alexandria. Caesar then attempted to reconcile the rival Ptolemaic siblings but Ptolemys chief adviser Potheinos viewed Caesars terms as favoring Cleopatra so his forces besieged her and Caesar at the palace. Shortly after the siege was lifted by reinforcements Ptolemy XIII died in the Battle of the Nile Cleopatras halfsister Arsinoe IV was eventually exiled to Ephesus for her role in carrying out the siege. Caesar declared Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIV joint rulers but maintained a private affair with Cleopatra that produced a son Caesarion. Cleopatra traveled to Rome as a client queen in 46 and 44 BC where she stayed at Caesars villa. After Caesars assassination followed shortly afterwards by that of Ptolemy XIV on Cleopatras orders she named Caesarion coruler as Ptolemy XV. In the Liberators civil war of 4342 BC Cleopatra sided with the Roman Second Triumvirate formed by Caesars grandnephew and heir Octavian Mark Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. After their meeting at Tarsos in 41 BC the queen had an affair with Antony which produced three children. He carried out the execution of Arsinoe at her request and became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding and military aid during his invasions of the Parthian Empire and the Kingdom of Armenia. The Donations of Alexandria declared their children rulers over various erstwhile territories under Antonys triumviral authority. This event their marriage and Antonys divorce of Octavians sister Octavia Minor led to the final war of the Roman Republic. Octavian engaged in a war of propaganda forced Antonys allies in the Roman Senate to flee Rome in 32 BC and declared war on Cleopatra. After defeating Antony and Cleopatras naval fleet at the 31 BC Battle of Actium Octavians forces invaded Egypt in 30 BC and defeated Antony leading to Antonys suicide. When Cleopatra learned that Octavian planned to bring her to his Roman triumphal procession she killed herself by poisoning contrary to the popular belief that she was bitten by an asp. Cleopatras legacy survives in ancient and modern works of art. Roman historiography and Latin poetry produced a generally critical view of the queen that pervaded later Medieval and Renaissance literature. In the visual arts her ancient depictions include Roman busts paintings and sculptures cameo carvings and glass Ptolemaic and Roman coinage and reliefs. In Renaissance and Baroque art she was the subject of many works including operas paintings poetry sculptures and theatrical dramas. She has become a pop culture icon of Egyptomania since the Victorian era and in modern times Cleopatra has appeared in the applied and fine arts burlesque satire Hollywood films and brand images for commercial products. Etymology The Latinized form Cleopatra comes from the Ancient Greek Kleoptra  meaning glory of her father5 from  klos glory and  patr father.6 The masculine form would have been written either as Klepatros  or Ptroklos .6 Cleopatra was the name of Alexander the Greats sister Cleopatra of Macedonia as well as the wife of Meleager in Greek mythology Cleopatra Alcyone.7 Through the marriage of Ptolemy V Epiphanes and Cleopatra I Syra a Seleucid princess the name entered the Ptolemaic dynasty.89 Cleopatras adopted title The Philoptra   means goddess who loves her father.10
11 note 11 Background Hellenistic portrait of Ptolemy XII Auletes the father of Cleopatra in the Louvre Paris12 Ptolemaic pharaohs were crowned by the Egyptian high priest of Ptah at Memphis but resided in the multicultural and largely Greek city of Alexandria established by Alexander the Great.1314
15 note 12 They spoke Greek and governed Egypt as Hellenistic Greek monarchs refusing to learn the native Egyptian language.1617
18 note 10 In contrast Cleopatra could speak multiple languages by adulthood and was the first Ptolemaic ruler known to learn the Egyptian language.1920
18 note 13 Plutarch implies that she also spoke Ethiopian the language of the Troglodytes Hebrew or Aramaic Arabic the Syrian language perhaps Syriac Median and Parthian and she could apparently also speak Latin although her Roman contemporaries would have preferred to speak with her in her native Koine Greek.2018
21 note 14 Aside from Greek Egyptian and Latin these languages reflected Cleopatras desire to restore North African and West Asian territories that once belonged to the Ptolemaic Kingdom.22 Roman interventionism in Egypt predated the reign of Cleopatra.232425 When Ptolemy IX Lathyros died in late 81 BC he was succeeded by his daughter Berenice III.2627 With opposition building at the royal court against the idea of a sole reigning female monarch Berenice III accepted joint rule and marriage with her cousin and stepson Ptolemy XI Alexander II an arrangement made by the Roman dictator Sulla.2627 Ptolemy XI had his wife killed shortly after their marriage in 80 BC and was lynched soon after in the resulting riot over the assassination.262829 Ptolemy XI and perhaps his uncle Ptolemy IX or father Ptolemy X Alexander I willed the Ptolemaic Kingdom to Rome as collateral for loans so that the Romans had legal grounds to take over Egypt their client state after the assassination of Ptolemy XI.263031 The Romans chose instead to divide the Ptolemaic realm among the illegitimate sons of Ptolemy IX bestowing Cyprus on Ptolemy of Cyprus and Egypt on Ptolemy XII Auletes.2628 Biography Early childhood Main article Early life of Cleopatra Cleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to the ruling Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy XII and an uncertain mother32

39 note 17 Cleopatra Tryphaena disappears from official records a few months after the birth of Cleopatra in 69 BC.4041 The three younger children of Ptolemy XII Cleopatras sister Arsinoe IV and brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV373839 were born in the absence of his wife.4243 Cleopatras childhood tutor was Philostratos from whom she learned the Greek arts of oration and philosophy.44 During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the Musaeum including the Library of Alexandria.4546 Reign and exile of Ptolemy XII Main article Early life of Cleopatra Further information First Triumvirate Most likely a posthumously painted portrait of Cleopatra with red hair and her distinct facial features wearing a royal diadem and pearlstudded hairpins from Roman Herculaneum Italy

48 note 18 In 65 BC the Roman censor Marcus Licinius Crassus argued before the Roman Senate that Rome should annex Ptolemaic Egypt but his proposed bill and the similar bill of tribune Servilius Rullus in 63 BC were rejected.4950 Ptolemy XII responded to the threat of possible annexation by offering remuneration and lavish gifts to powerful Roman statesmen such as Pompey during his campaign against Mithridates VI of Pontus and eventually Julius Caesar after he became Roman consul in 59 BC.5152
53 note 19 However Ptolemy XIIs profligate behavior bankrupted him and he was forced to acquire loans from the Roman banker Gaius Rabirius Postumus.545556 In 58 BC the Romans annexed Cyprus and on accusations of piracy drove Ptolemy of Cyprus Ptolemy XIIs brother to commit suicide instead of enduring exile to Paphos.5758
56 note 20 Ptolemy XII remained publicly silent on the death of his brother a decision which along with ceding traditional Ptolemaic territory to the Romans damaged his credibility among subjects already enraged by his economic policies.575960 Ptolemy XII was then exiled from Egypt by force traveling first to Rhodes then Athens and finally the villa of triumvir Pompey in the Alban Hills near Praeneste Italy.5758
61 note 21 Ptolemy XII spent nearly a year there on the outskirts of Rome ostensibly accompanied by his daughter Cleopatra then about 
11.5 7
61 note 22 Berenice IV sent an embassy to Rome to advocate for her rule and oppose the reinstatement of her father Ptolemy XII. Ptolemy had assassins kill the leaders of the embassy an incident that was covered up by his powerful Roman supporters.6255
63 note 23 When the Roman Senate denied Ptolemy XII the offer of an armed escort and provisions for a return to Egypt he decided to leave Rome in late 57 BC and reside at the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus.646566 The Roman financiers of Ptolemy XII remained determined to restore him to power.67 Pompey persuaded Aulus Gabinius the Roman governor of Syria to invade Egypt and restore Ptolemy XII offering him 10000 talents for the proposed mission.676869 Although it put him at odds with Roman law Gabinius invaded Egypt in the spring of 55 BC by way of Hasmonean Judea where Hyrcanus II had Antipater the Idumaean father of Herod the Great furnish the Romanled army with supplies.6770 As a young cavalry officer Mark Antony was under Gabiniuss command.71 He distinguished himself by preventing Ptolemy XII from massacring the inhabitants of Pelousion and for rescuing the body of Archelaos the husband of Berenice IV after he was killed in battle ensuring him a proper royal burial.7273 Cleopatra then 14 years of age would have traveled with the Roman expedition into Egypt years later Antony would profess that he had fallen in love with her at this time.7274 The Roman Republic green and Ptolemaic Egypt yellow in 40 BC Gabinius was put on trial in Rome for abusing his authority for which he was acquitted but his second trial for accepting bribes led to his exile from which he was recalled seven years later in 48 BC by Caesar.7576 Crassus replaced him as governor of Syria and extended his provincial command to Egypt but he was killed by the Parthians at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC.7577 Ptolemy XII had Berenice IV and her wealthy supporters executed seizing their properties.787980 He allowed Gabiniuss largely Germanic and Gallic Roman garrison the Gabiniani to harass people in the streets of Alexandria and installed his longtime Roman financier Rabirius as his chief financial officer.7881
82 note 24 Within a year Rabirius was placed under protective custody and sent back to Rome after his life was endangered for draining Egypt of its resources.8384
80 note 25 Despite these problems Ptolemy XII created a will designating Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs oversaw major construction projects such as the Temple of Edfu and a temple at Dendera and stabilized the economy.8584
86 note 26 On 31 May 52 BC Cleopatra was made a regent of Ptolemy XII as indicated by an inscription in the Temple of Hathor at Dendera.8788
89 note 27 Rabirius was unable to collect the entirety of Ptolemy XIIs debt by the time of the latters death and so it was passed on to his successors Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII.8376 Accession to the throne Main articles Early life of Cleopatra and Reign of Cleopatra Left A limestone stele dedicated by a Greek man named Onnophris depicting a male pharaoh but honouring a queen Cleopatra probably Cleopatra VII located in the Louvre Parisnote 28 Right The cartouches of Cleopatra and Caesarion on a limestone stele of the High Priest of Ptah Pasherienptah III in Egypt dated to the Ptolemaic period and located in the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology London Ptolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC when Cleopatra in her first act as queen began her voyage to Hermonthis near Thebes to install a new sacred Buchis bull worshiped as an intermediary for the god Montu in the Ancient Egyptian religion.9091
92 note 29 Cleopatra faced several pressing issues and emergencies shortly after taking the throne. These included famine caused by drought and a low level of the annual flooding of the Nile and lawless behavior instigated by the Gabiniani the now unemployed and assimilated Roman soldiers left by Gabinius to garrison Egypt.9394 Inheriting her fathers debts Cleopatra also owed the Roman Republic 
17.5  million drachmas.95 In 50 BC Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus proconsul of Syria sent his two eldest sons to Egypt most likely to negotiate with the Gabiniani and recruit them as soldiers in the desperate defense of Syria against the Parthians.96 The Gabiniani tortured and murdered these two perhaps with secret encouragement by rogue senior administrators in Cleopatras court.9697 Cleopatra sent the Gabiniani culprits to Bibulus as prisoners awaiting his judgment but he sent them back to Cleopatra and chastised her for interfering in their adjudication which was the prerogative of the Roman Senate.9897 Bibulus siding with Pompey in Caesars Civil War failed to prevent Caesar from landing a naval fleet in Greece which ultimately allowed Caesar to reach Egypt in pursuit of Pompey.98 By 29 August 51 BC official documents started listing Cleopatra as the sole ruler evidence that she had rejected her brother Ptolemy XIII as a coruler.959799 She had probably married him77 but there is no record of this.90 The Ptolemaic practice of sibling marriage was introduced by Ptolemy II and his sister Arsinoe II.100101102 A longheld royal Egyptian practice it was loathed by contemporary Greeks.1001011
02 note 30 By the reign of Cleopatra however it was considered a normal arrangement for Ptolemaic rulers.100101102 Despite Cleopatras rejection of him Ptolemy XIII still retained powerful allies notably the eunuch Potheinos his childhood tutor regent and administrator of his properties.10394104 Others involved in the cabal against Cleopatra included Achillas a prominent military commander and Theodotus of Chios another tutor of Ptolemy XIII.103105 Cleopatra seems to have attempted a shortlived alliance with her brother Ptolemy XIV but by the autumn of 50 BC Ptolemy XIII had the upper hand in their conflict and began signing documents with his name before that of his sister followed by the establishment of his first regnal date in 49 BC.901061
07 note 31 Assassination of Pompey Main article Reign of Cleopatra A Roman portrait of Pompey made during the reign of Augustus 27 BC  14 AD a copy of an original from 70 to 60 BC and located in the Venice National Archaeological Museum Italy In the summer of 49 BC Cleopatra and her forces were still fighting against Ptolemy XIII within Alexandria when Pompeys son Gnaeus Pompeius arrived seeking military aid on behalf of his father.106 After returning to Italy from the wars in Gaul and crossing the Rubicon in January of 49 BC Caesar had forced Pompey and his supporters to flee to Greece.108109 In perhaps their last joint decree both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII agreed to Gnaeus Pompeiuss request and sent his father 60 ships and 500 troops including the Gabiniani a move that helped erase some of the debt owed to Rome.108110 Losing the fight against her brother Cleopatra was then forced to flee Alexandria and withdraw to the region of Thebes.111112113 By the spring of 48 BC Cleopatra had traveled to Roman Syria with her younger sister Arsinoe IV to gather an invasion force that would head to Egypt.114107115 She returned with an army but her advance to Alexandria was blocked by her brothers forces including some Gabiniani mobilized to fight against her so she camped outside Pelousion in the eastern Nile Delta.116107117 In Greece Caesar and Pompeys forces engaged each other at the decisive Battle of Pharsalus on 9 August 48 BC leading to the destruction of most of Pompeys army and his forced flight to Tyre Lebanon.1161181
19 note 32 Given his close relationship with the Ptolemies Pompey ultimately decided that Egypt would be his place of refuge where he could replenish his forces.1201191
17 note 33 Ptolemy XIIIs advisers however feared the idea of Pompey using Egypt as his base in a protracted Roman civil war.120121122 In a scheme devised by Theodotus Pompey arrived by ship near Pelousion after being invited by a written message only to be ambushed and stabbed to death on 28 September 48 BC.1201181
23 note 34 Ptolemy XIII believed he had demonstrated his power and simultaneously defused the situation by having Pompeys head severed and embalmed sent to Caesar who arrived in Alexandria by early October and took up residence at the royal palace.1241251
26 note 34 Caesar expressed grief and outrage over the killing of Pompey and called on both Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra to disband their forces and reconcile with each other.1241271
26 note 35 Relationship with Julius Caesar Main article Reign of Cleopatra Further information Military campaigns of Julius Caesar Siege of Alexandria 47 BC Battle of the Nile 47 BC and Caesareum of Alexandria Cleopatra and Caesar 1866 a painting by JeanLon Grme Ptolemy XIII arrived at Alexandria at the head of his army in clear defiance of Caesars demand that he disband and leave his army before his arrival.128129 Cleopatra initially sent emissaries to Caesar but upon allegedly hearing that Caesar was inclined to having affairs with royal women she came to Alexandria to see him personally.128130129 Historian Cassius Dio records that she did so without informing her brother dressed in an attractive manner and charmed Caesar with her wit.128131132 Plutarch provides an entirely different account that alleges she was bound inside a bed sack to be smuggled into the palace to meet Caesar.1281331
34 note 36 When Ptolemy XIII realized that his sister was in the palace consorting directly with Caesar he attempted to rouse the populace of Alexandria into a riot but he was arrested by Caesar who used his oratorical skills to calm the frenzied crowd.135136137 Caesar then brought Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII before the assembly of Alexandria where Caesar revealed the written will of Ptolemy XIIpreviously possessed by Pompeynaming Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs.1381361
30 note 37 Caesar then attempted to arrange for the other two siblings Arsinoe IV and Ptolemy XIV to rule together over Cyprus thus removing potential rival claimants to the Egyptian throne while also appeasing the Ptolemaic subjects still bitter over the loss of Cyprus to the Romans in 58 BC.1391361
40 note 37 Judging that this agreement favored Cleopatra over Ptolemy XIII and that the latters army of 20000 including the Gabiniani could most likely defeat Caesars army of 4000 unsupported troops Potheinos decided to have Achillas lead their forces to Alexandria to attack both Caesar and Cleopatra.1391361
41 note 38 After Caesar managed to execute Potheinos Arsinoe IV joined forces with Achillas and was declared queen but soon afterward had her tutor Ganymedes kill Achillas and take his position as commander of her army.1421431
44 note 39 Ganymedes then tricked Caesar into requesting the presence of the erstwhile captive Ptolemy XIII as a negotiator only to have him join the army of Arsinoe IV.142145146 The resulting siege of the palace with Caesar and Cleopatra trapped together inside lasted into the following year of 47 BC.1471271
48 note 40 The Tusculum portrait a contemporary Roman sculpture of Julius Caesar located in the Archaeological Museum of Turin Italy Sometime between January and March of 47 BC Caesars reinforcements arrived including those led by Mithridates of Pergamon and Antipater the Idumaean.1421271
49 note 41 Ptolemy XIII and Arsinoe IV withdrew their forces to the Nile where Caesar attacked them. Ptolemy XIII tried to flee by boat but it capsized and he drowned.1501271
51 note 42 Ganymedes may have been killed in the battle. Theodotus was found years later in Asia by Marcus Junius Brutus and executed. Arsinoe IV was forcefully paraded in Caesars triumph in Rome before being exiled to the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus.152153154 Cleopatra was conspicuously absent from these events and resided in the palace most likely because she had been pregnant with Caesars child since September 48 BC.155156157 Caesars term as consul had expired at the end of 48 BC.152 However Antony an officer of his helped to secure Caesars appointment as dictator lasting for a year until October 47 BC providing Caesar with the legal authority to settle the dynastic dispute in Egypt.152 Wary of repeating the mistake of Cleopatras sister Berenice IV in having a female monarch as sole ruler Caesar appointed Cleopatras 
12 yearold brother Ptolemy XIV as joint ruler with the 
22 yearold Cleopatra in a nominal sibling marriage but Cleopatra continued living privately with Caesar.1581271
49 note 43 The exact date at which Cyprus was returned to her control is not known although she had a governor there by 42 BC.159149 Caesar is alleged to have joined Cleopatra for a cruise of the Nile and sightseeing of Egyptian monuments127160161 although this may be a romantic tale reflecting later welltodo Roman proclivities and not a real historical event.162 The historian Suetonius provided considerable details about the voyage including use of Thalamegos the pleasure barge constructed by Ptolemy IV which during his reign measured 90 metres 300 ft in length and 24 metres 80 ft in height and was complete with dining rooms state rooms holy shrines and promenades along its two decks resembling a floating villa.162163 Caesar could have had an interest in the Nile cruise owing to his fascination with geography he was wellread in the works of Eratosthenes and Pytheas and perhaps wanted to discover the source of the river but turned back before reaching Ethiopia.164165 Caesar departed from Egypt around April 47 BC allegedly to confront Pharnaces II of Pontus the son of Mithridates VI of Pontus who was stirring up trouble for Rome in Anatolia.166 It is possible that Caesar married to the prominent Roman woman Calpurnia also wanted to avoid being seen together with Cleopatra when she had their son.166160 He left three legions in Egypt later increased to four under the command of the freedman Rufio to secure Cleopatras tenuous position but also perhaps to keep her activities in check.166167168 An Egyptian portrait of a Ptolemaic queen possibly Cleopatra c.5130 BC located in the Brooklyn Museum169 Caesarion Cleopatras alleged child with Caesar was born 23 June 47 BC and was originally named Pharaoh Caesar as preserved on a stele at the Serapeum of Saqqara.1701271
71 note 44 Perhaps owing to his still childless marriage with Calpurnia Caesar remained publicly silent about Caesarion but perhaps accepted his parentage in private.1
72 note 45 Cleopatra on the other hand made repeated official declarations about Caesarions parentage naming Caesar as the father.172173174 Cleopatra and her nominal joint ruler Ptolemy XIV visited Rome sometime in late 46 BC presumably without Caesarion and were given lodging in Caesars villa within the Horti Caesaris.1751711
76 note 46 As with their father Ptolemy XII Caesar awarded both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIV the legal status of friend and ally of the Roman people Latin socius et amicus populi Romani in effect client rulers loyal to Rome.177178179 Cleopatras visitors at Caesars villa across the Tiber included the senator Cicero who found her arrogant.180181 Sosigenes of Alexandria one of the members of Cleopatras court aided Caesar in the calculations for the new Julian calendar put into effect 1 January 45 BC.182183184 The Temple of Venus Genetrix established in the Forum of Caesar on 25 September 46 BC contained a golden statue of Cleopatra which stood there at least until the 
3 rd century AD associating the mother of Caesars child directly with the goddess Venus mother of the Romans.185183186 The statue also subtly linked the Egyptian goddess Isis with the Roman religion.180 Cleopatras presence in Rome most likely had an effect on the events at the Lupercalia festival a month before Caesars assassination.187188 Antony attempted to place a royal diadem on Caesars head but the latter refused in what was most likely a staged performance perhaps to gauge the Roman publics mood about accepting Hellenisticstyle kingship.187188 Cicero who was present at the festival mockingly asked where the diadem came from an obvious reference to the Ptolemaic queen whom he abhorred.187188 Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March 15 March 44 BC but Cleopatra stayed in Rome until about midApril in the vain hope of having Caesarion recognized as Caesars heir.189190191 However Caesars will named his grandnephew Octavian as the primary heir and Octavian arrived in Italy around the same time Cleopatra decided to depart for Egypt.189190192 A few months later Cleopatra had Ptolemy XIV killed by poisoning elevating her son Caesarion as her coruler.1931941
74 note 47 Cleopatra in the Liberators civil war Main article Reign of Cleopatra Further information Liberators civil war Cleopatras Gate in Tarsos now Tarsus Mersin Turkey the site where she met Mark Antony in 41 BC195 Octavian Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC in which they were each elected for fiveyear terms to restore order in the Republic and bring Caesars assassins to justice.196197 Cleopatra received messages from both Gaius Cassius Longinus one of Caesars assassins and Publius Cornelius Dolabella proconsul of Syria and Caesarian loyalist requesting military aid.196 She decided to write Cassius an excuse that her kingdom faced too many internal problems while sending the four legions left by Caesar in Egypt to Dolabella.196198 These troops were captured by Cassius in Palestine.196198 While Serapion Cleopatras governor of Cyprus defected to Cassius and provided him with ships Cleopatra took her own fleet to Greece to personally assist Octavian and Antony. Her ships were heavily damaged in a Mediterranean storm and she arrived too late to aid in the fighting.196199 By the autumn of 42 BC Antony had defeated the forces of Caesars assassins at the Battle of Philippi in Greece leading to the suicide of Cassius and Brutus.196200 By the end of 42 BC Octavian had gained control over much of the western half of the Roman Republic and Antony the eastern half with Lepidus largely marginalized.201 In the summer of 41 BC Antony established his headquarters at Tarsos in Anatolia and summoned Cleopatra there in several letters which she rebuffed until Antonys envoy Quintus Dellius convinced her to come.202203 The meeting would allow Cleopatra to clear up the misconception that she had supported Cassius during the civil war and address territorial exchanges in the Levant but Antony also undoubtedly desired to form a personal romantic relationship with the queen.204203 Cleopatra sailed up the Kydnos River to Tarsos in Thalamegos hosting Antony and his officers for two nights of lavish banquets on board the ship.2052

1 st century AD Vatican Museums Cleopatra invited Antony to come to Egypt before departing from Tarsos which led Antony to visit Alexandria by November 41 BC.207210 Antony was well received by the populace of Alexandria both for his heroic actions in restoring Ptolemy XII to power and coming to Egypt without an occupation force like Caesar had done.211212 In Egypt Antony continued to enjoy the lavish royal lifestyle he had witnessed aboard Cleopatras ship docked at Tarsos.213209 He also had his subordinates such as Publius Ventidius Bassus drive the Parthians out of Anatolia and Syria.2122142
15 note 49 Cleopatra carefully chose Antony as her partner for producing further heirs as he was deemed to be the most powerful Roman figure following Caesars demise.216 With his powers as a triumvir Antony also had the broad authority to restore former Ptolemaic lands which were currently in Roman hands to Cleopatra.217218 While it is clear that both Cilicia and Cyprus were under Cleopatras control by 19 November 38 BC the transfer probably occurred earlier in the winter of 4140 BC during her time spent with Antony.217 By the spring of 40 BC Antony left Egypt due to troubles in Syria where his governor Lucius Decidius Saxa was killed and his army taken by Quintus Labienus a former officer under Cassius who now served the Parthian Empire.219 Cleopatra provided Antony with 200 ships for his campaign and as payment for her newly acquired territories.219 She would not see Antony again until 37 BC but she maintained correspondence and evidence suggests she kept a spy in his camp.219 By the end of 40 BC Cleopatra had given birth to twins a boy named Alexander Helios and a girl named Cleopatra Selene II both of whom Antony acknowledged as his children.220221 Helios the Sun and Selene the Moon were symbolic of a new era of societal rejuvenation222 as well as an indication that Cleopatra hoped Antony would repeat the exploits of Alexander the Great by conquering the Parthians.212 The Meeting of Antony and Cleopatra 1885 by Lawrence AlmaTadema Mark Antonys Parthian campaign in the east was disrupted by the events of the Perusine War 4140 BC initiated by his ambitious wife Fulvia against Octavian in the hopes of making her husband the undisputed leader of Rome.222223 It has been suggested that Fulvia wanted to cleave Antony away from Cleopatra but the conflict emerged in Italy even before Cleopatras meeting with Antony at Tarsos.224 Fulvia and Antonys brother Lucius Antonius were eventually besieged by Octavian at Perusia modern Perugia Italy and then exiled from Italy after which Fulvia died at Sicyon in Greece while attempting to reach Antony.225 Her sudden death led to a reconciliation of Octavian and Antony at Brundisium in Italy in September 40 BC.225212 Although the agreement struck at Brundisium solidified Antonys control of the Roman Republics territories east of the Ionian Sea it also stipulated that he concede Italia Hispania and Gaul and marry Octavians sister Octavia the Younger a potential rival for Cleopatra.226227 In December 40 BC Cleopatra received Herod in Alexandria as an unexpected guest and refugee who fled a turbulent situation in Judea.228 Herod had been installed as a tetrarch there by Antony but he was soon at odds with Antigonus II Mattathias of the longestablished Hasmonean dynasty.228 The latter had imprisoned Herods brother and fellow tetrarch Phasael who was executed while Herod was fleeing toward Cleopatras court.228 Cleopatra attempted to provide him with a military assignment but Herod declined and traveled to Rome where the triumvirs Octavian and Antony named him king of Judea.229230 This act put Herod on a collision course with Cleopatra who would desire to reclaim the former Ptolemaic territories that comprised his new Herodian kingdom.229 An ancient Roman sculpture possibly depicting either Cleopatra of Ptolemaic Egypt2312

18 note 51 In this arrangement Cleopatra gained significant former Ptolemaic territories in the Levant including nearly all of Phoenicia Lebanon minus Tyre and Sidon which remained in Roman hands.241218237 She also received Ptolemais Akko modern Acre Israel a city that was established by Ptolemy II.241 Given her ancestral relations with the Seleucids she was granted the region of CoeleSyria along the upper Orontes River.242237 She was even given the region surrounding Jericho in Palestine but she leased this territory back to Herod.243230 At the expense of the Nabataean king Malichus I a cousin of Herod Cleopatra was also given a portion of the Nabataean Kingdom around the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea including Ailana modern Aqaba Jordan.244230 To the west Cleopatra was handed Cyrene along the Libyan coast as well as Itanos and Olous in Roman Crete.245237 Although still administered by Roman officials these territories nevertheless enriched her kingdom and led her to declare the inauguration of a new era by doubledating her coinage in 36 BC.246247 Roman aureus bearing the portraits of Mark Antony left and Octavian right issued in 41 BC to celebrate the establishment of the Second Triumvirate by Octavian Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in 43 BC Antonys enlargement of the Ptolemaic realm by relinquishing directly controlled Roman territory was exploited by his rival Octavian who tapped into the public sentiment in Rome against the empowerment of a foreign queen at the expense of their Republic.248 Octavian fostering the narrative that Antony was neglecting his virtuous Roman wife Octavia granted both her and Livia his own wife extraordinary privileges of sacrosanctity.248 Some 50 years before Cornelia Africana daughter of Scipio Africanus had been the first living Roman woman to have a statue dedicated to her.246 She was now followed by Octavia and Livia whose statues were most likely erected in the Forum of Caesar to rival that of Cleopatras erected by Caesar.246 In 36 BC Cleopatra accompanied Antony to the Euphrates in his journey toward invading the Parthian Empire.249 She then returned to Egypt perhaps due to her advanced state of pregnancy.250 By the summer of 36 BC she had given birth to Ptolemy Philadelphus her second son with Antony.250237 Antonys Parthian campaign in 36 BC turned into a complete debacle for a number of reasons in particular the betrayal of Artavasdes II of Armenia who defected to the Parthian side.251218252 After losing some 30000 men more than Crassus at Carrhae an indignity he had hoped to avenge Antony finally arrived at Leukokome near Berytus modern Beirut Lebanon in December engaged in heavy drinking before Cleopatra arrived to provide funds and clothing for his battered troops.251253 Antony desired to avoid the risks involved in returning to Rome and so he traveled with Cleopatra back to Alexandria to see his newborn son.251 Donations of Alexandria Main articles Donations of Alexandria and Reign of Cleopatra A denarius minted by Antony in 34 BC with his portrait on the obverse which bears the inscription reading ANTONIVS ARMENIA DEVICTA alluding to his Armenian campaign. The reverse features Cleopatra with the inscription CLEOPATRAE REGINAE REGVM FILIORVM REGVM. The mention of her children on the reverse refers to the Donations of Alexandria.254255 As Antony prepared for another Parthian expedition in 35 BC this time aimed at their ally Armenia Octavia traveled to Athens with 2000 troops in alleged support of Antony but most likely in a scheme devised by Octavian to embarrass him for his military losses.2562
57 note 52 Antony received these troops but told Octavia not to stray east of Athens as he and Cleopatra traveled together to Antioch only to suddenly and inexplicably abandon the military campaign and head back to Alexandria.256257 When Octavia returned to Rome Octavian portrayed his sister as a victim wronged by Antony although she refused to leave Antonys household.258218 Octavians confidence grew as he eliminated his rivals in the west including Sextus Pompeius and even Lepidus the third member of the triumvirate who was placed under house arrest after revolting against Octavian in Sicily.258218253 Dellius was sent as Antonys envoy to Artavasdes II in 34 BC to negotiate a potential marriage alliance that would wed the Armenian kings daughter to Alexander Helios the son of Antony and Cleopatra.259260 When this was declined Antony marched his army into Armenia defeated their forces and captured the king and Armenian royal family.259261 Antony then held a military parade in Alexandria as an imitation of a Roman triumph dressed as Dionysus and riding into the city on a chariot to present the royal prisoners to Cleopatra who was seated on a golden throne above a silver dais.259262 News of this event was heavily criticized in Rome as a perversion of timehonored Roman rites and rituals to be enjoyed instead by an Egyptian queen.259 A papyrus document dated February 33 BC granting tax exemptions to a person in Egypt and containing the signature of Cleopatra written by an official but with  ginsthi lit. make it happen263264 or so be it265 added in Greek likely by the queens own hand263264265 In an event held at the gymnasium soon after the triumph Cleopatra dressed as Isis and declared that she was the Queen of Kings with her son Caesarion King of Kings while Alexander Helios was declared king of Armenia Media and Parthia and twoyearold Ptolemy Philadelphos was declared king of Syria and Cilicia.266267268 Cleopatra Selene II was bestowed with Crete and Cyrene.269270 Antony and Cleopatra may have been wed during this ceremony.2692
68 note 53 Antony sent a report to Rome requesting ratification of these territorial claims now known as the Donations of Alexandria. Octavian wanted to publicize it for propaganda purposes but the two consuls both supporters of Antony had it censored from public view.271270 In late 34 BC Antony and Octavian engaged in a heated war of propaganda that would last for years.2722701
74 note 54 Antony claimed that his rival had illegally deposed Lepidus from their triumvirate and barred him from raising troops in Italy while Octavian accused Antony of unlawfully detaining the king of Armenia marrying Cleopatra despite still being married to his sister Octavia and wrongfully claiming Caesarion as the heir of Caesar instead of Octavian.272270 The litany of accusations and gossip associated with this propaganda war have shaped the popular perceptions about Cleopatra from Augustanperiod literature through to various media in modern times.273274 Cleopatra was said to have brainwashed Mark Antony with witchcraft and sorcery and was as dangerous as Homers Helen of Troy in destroying civilization.275 Pliny the Elder claims in his Natural History that Cleopatra once dissolved a pearl worth tens of millions of sesterces in vinegar just to win a dinnerparty bet.276277 The accusation that Antony had stolen books from the Library of Pergamum to restock the Library of Alexandria later turned out to be an admitted fabrication by Gaius Calvisius Sabinus.278 A papyrus document dated to February 33 BC later used to wrap a mummy contains the signature of Cleopatra probably written by an official authorized to sign for her.263264 It concerns certain tax exemptions in Egypt granted to either Quintus Caecillius or Publius Canidius Crassusnote 55 a former Roman consul and Antonys confidant who would command his land forces at Actium.279264 A subscript in a different handwriting at the bottom of the papyrus reads make it happen279264 or so be it265 Ancient Greek  romanized ginsthinote 56 this is likely the autograph of the queen as it was Ptolemaic practice to countersign documents to avoid forgery.279264 Battle of Actium Main articles Battle of Actium and Reign of Cleopatra A reconstructed statue of Augustus as a younger Octavian dated c.30 BC In a speech to the Roman Senate on the first day of his consulship on 1 January 33 BC Octavian accused Antony of attempting to subvert Roman freedoms and territorial integrity as a slave to his Oriental queen.280 Before Antony and Octavians joint imperium expired on 31 December 33 BC Antony declared Caesarion as the true heir of Caesar in an attempt to undermine Octavian.280 In 32 BC the Antonian loyalists Gaius Sosius and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus became consuls. The former gave a fiery speech condemning Octavian now a private citizen without public office and introduced pieces of legislation against him.279281 During the next senatorial session Octavian entered the Senate house with armed guards and levied his own accusations against the consuls.279282 Intimidated by this act the consuls and over 200 senators still in support of Antony fled Rome the next day to join the side of Antony.279282283 Antony and Cleopatra traveled together to Ephesus in 32 BC where she provided him with 200 of the 800 naval ships he was able to acquire.279 Ahenobarbus wary of having Octavians propaganda confirmed to the public attempted to persuade Antony to have Cleopatra excluded from the campaign against Octavian.284285 Publius Canidius Crassus made the counterargument that Cleopatra was funding the war effort and was a competent monarch.284285 Cleopatra refused Antonys requests that she return to Egypt judging that by blocking Octavian in Greece she could more easily defend Egypt.284285 Cleopatras insistence that she be involved in the battle for Greece led to the defections of prominent Romans such as Ahenobarbus and Lucius Munatius Plancus.284282 During the spring of 32 BC Antony and Cleopatra traveled to Athens where she persuaded Antony to send Octavia an official declaration of divorce.284282268 This encouraged Plancus to advise Octavian that he should seize Antonys will invested with the Vestal Virgins.284282270 Although a violation of sacred and legal rights Octavian forcefully acquired the document from the Temple of Vesta and it became a useful tool in the propaganda war against Antony and Cleopatra.284270 Octavian highlighted parts of the will such as Caesarion being named heir to Caesar that the Donations of Alexandria were legal that Antony should be buried alongside Cleopatra in Egypt instead of Rome and that Alexandria would be made the new capital of the Roman Republic.286282270 In a show of loyalty to Rome Octavian decided to begin construction of his own mausoleum at the Campus Martius.282 Octavians legal standing was also improved by being elected consul in 31 BC.282 With Antonys will made public Octavian had his casus belli and Rome declared war on Cleopatra286287288 not Antony.note 57 The legal argument for war was based less on Cleopatras territorial acquisitions with former Roman territories ruled by her children with Antony and more on the fact that she was providing military support to a private citizen now that Antonys triumviral authority had expired.289 Left A silver tetradrachm of Cleopatra minted at Seleucia Pieria Syria Right A silver tetradrachm of Cleopatra minted at Ascalon Israel Antony and Cleopatra had a larger fleet than Octavian but the crews of Antony and Cleopatras navy were not all welltrained some of them perhaps from merchant vessels whereas Octavian had a fully professional force.290285 Antony wanted to cross the Adriatic Sea and blockade Octavian at either Tarentum or Brundisium291 but Cleopatra concerned primarily with defending Egypt overrode the decision to attack Italy directly.292285 Antony and Cleopatra set up their winter headquarters at Patrai in Greece and by the spring of 31 BC they had moved to Actium on the southern side of the Ambracian Gulf.292291 Cleopatra and Antony had the support of various allied kings but Cleopatra had already been in conflict with Herod and an earthquake in Judea provided him with an excuse to be absent from the campaign.293 They also lost the support of Malichus I which would prove to have strategic consequences.294 Antony and Cleopatra lost several skirmishes against Octavian around Actium during the summer of 31 BC while defections to Octavians camp continued including Antonys longtime companion Dellius294 and the allied kings Amyntas of Galatia and Deiotaros of Paphlagonia.294 While some in Antonys camp suggested abandoning the naval conflict to retreat inland Cleopatra urged for a naval confrontation to keep Octavians fleet away from Egypt.295 On 2 September 31 BC the naval forces of Octavian led by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa met those of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium.295291287 Cleopatra aboard her flagship the Antonias commanded 60 ships at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf at the rear of the fleet in what was likely a move by Antonys officers to marginalize her during the battle.295 Antony had ordered that their ships should have sails on board for a better chance to pursue or flee from the enemy which Cleopatra ever concerned about defending Egypt used to swiftly move through the area of major combat in a strategic withdrawal to the Peloponnese.296297298 Burstein writes that partisan Roman writers would later accuse Cleopatra of cowardly deserting Antony but their original intention of keeping their sails on board may have been to break the blockade and salvage as much of their fleet as possible.298 Antony followed Cleopatra and boarded her ship identified by its distinctive purple sails as the two escaped the battle and headed for Tainaron.296 Antony reportedly avoided Cleopatra during this threeday voyage until her ladies in waiting at Tainaron urged him to speak with her.299 The Battle of Actium raged on without Cleopatra and Antony until the morning of 3 September and was followed by massive defections of officers troops and allied kings to Octavians side.299297300 Downfall and death Main article Death of Cleopatra Further information Epaphroditus freedman of Augustus and Tomb of Antony and Cleopatra A Roman painting from the House of Giuseppe II in Pompeii early 
1 st century AD most likely depicting Cleopatra wearing her royal diadem and consuming poison in an act of suicide while her son Caesarion also wearing a royal diadem stands behind her301302 While Octavian occupied Athens Antony and Cleopatra landed at Paraitonion in Egypt.299303 The couple then went their separate ways Antony to Cyrene to raise more troops and Cleopatra to the harbor at Alexandria in an attempt to mislead the oppositional party and portray the activities in Greece as a victory.299 She was afraid that news about the outcome of the battle of Actium would lead to a rebellion.304 It is uncertain whether or not at this time she actually executed Artavasdes II and sent his head to his rival Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene in an attempt to strike an alliance with him.305306 Lucius Pinarius Mark Antonys appointed governor of Cyrene received word that Octavian had won the Battle of Actium before Antonys messengers could arrive at his court.305 Pinarius had these messengers executed and then defected to Octavians side surrendering to him the four legions under his command that Antony desired to obtain.305 Antony nearly committed suicide after hearing news of this but was stopped by his staff officers.305 In Alexandria he built a reclusive cottage on the island of Pharos that he nicknamed the Timoneion after the philosopher Timon of Athens who was famous for his cynicism and misanthropy.305 Herod who had personally advised Antony after the Battle of Actium that he should betray Cleopatra traveled to Rhodes to meet Octavian and resign his kingship out of loyalty to Antony.307 Octavian was impressed by his speech and sense of loyalty so he allowed him to maintain his position in Judea further isolating Antony and Cleopatra.307 Cleopatra perhaps started to view Antony as a liability by the late summer of 31 BC when she prepared to leave Egypt to her son Caesarion.308 Cleopatra planned to relinquish her throne to him take her fleet from the Mediterranean into the Red Sea and then set sail to a foreign port perhaps in India where she could spend time recuperating.308306 However these plans were ultimately abandoned when Malichus I as advised by Octavians governor of Syria Quintus Didius managed to burn Cleopatras fleet in revenge for his losses in a war with Herod that Cleopatra had largely initiated.308306 Cleopatra had no other option but to stay in Egypt and negotiate with Octavian.308 Although most likely later proOctavian propaganda it was reported that at this time Cleopatra started testing the strengths of various poisons on prisoners and even her own servants.309 The Death of Cleopatra 1658 by Guido Cagnacci Cleopatra had Caesarion enter into the ranks of the ephebi which along with reliefs on a stele from Koptos dated 21 September 31 BC demonstrated that Cleopatra was now grooming her son to become the sole ruler of Egypt.310 In a show of solidarity Antony also had Marcus Antonius Antyllus his son with Fulvia enter the ephebi at the same time.308 Separate messages and envoys from Antony and Cleopatra were then sent to Octavian still stationed at Rhodes although Octavian seems to have replied only to Cleopatra.309 Cleopatra requested that her children should inherit Egypt and that Antony should be allowed to live in exile in Egypt offered Octavian money in the future and immediately sent him lavish gifts.309306 Octavian sent his diplomat Thyrsos to Cleopatra after she threatened to burn herself and vast amounts of her treasure within a tomb already under construction.311 Thyrsos advised her to kill Antony so that her life would be spared but when Antony suspected foul intent he had this diplomat flogged and sent back to Octavian without a deal.312 After lengthy negotiations that ultimately produced no results Octavian set out to invade Egypt in the spring of 30 BC313 stopping at Ptolemais in Phoenicia where his new ally Herod provided his army with fresh supplies.314 Octavian moved south and swiftly took Pelousion while Cornelius Gallus marching eastward from Cyrene defeated Antonys forces near Paraitonion.315316 Octavian advanced quickly to Alexandria but Antony returned and won a small victory over Octavians tired troops outside the citys hippodrome.315316 However on 1 August 30 BC Antonys naval fleet surrendered to Octavian followed by Antonys cavalry.315297317 Cleopatra hid herself in her tomb with her close attendants and sent a message to Antony that she had committed suicide.315318319 In despair Antony responded to this by stabbing himself in the stomach and taking his own life at age 
53.3 15297306 According to Plutarch he was still dying when brought to Cleopatra at her tomb telling her he had died honorably and that she could trust Octavians companion Gaius Proculeius over anyone else in his entourage.315320321 It was Proculeius however who infiltrated her tomb using a ladder and detained the queen denying her the ability to burn herself with her treasures.322323 Cleopatra was then allowed to embalm and bury Antony within her tomb before she was escorted to the palace.322306 The Death of Cleopatra 17961797 by JeanBaptiste Regnault Octavian entered Alexandria occupied the palace and seized Cleopatras three youngest children.322324 When she met with Octavian Cleopatra told him bluntly I will not be led in a triumph Ancient Greek   romanized ou thriambusomai according to Livy a rare recording of her exact words.325326 Octavian promised that he would keep her alive but offered no explanation about his future plans for her kingdom.327 When a spy informed her that Octavian planned to move her and her children to Rome in three days she prepared for suicide as she had no intentions of being paraded in a Roman triumph like her sister Arsinoe IV.327297306 It is unclear if Cleopatras suicide on 10 August 30 BC at age 39 took place within the palace or her tomb.3283
29 note 4 It is said she was accompanied by her servants Eiras and Charmion who also took their own lives.327330 Octavian was said to have been angered by this outcome but had Cleopatra buried in royal fashion next to Antony in her tomb.327331332 Cleopatras physician Olympos did not explain her cause of death although the popular belief is that she allowed an asp or Egyptian cobra to bite and poison her.333334306 Plutarch relates this tale but then suggests an implement  knstis lit. spine cheesegrater was used to introduce the toxin by scratching while Dio says that she injected the poison with a needle  beln and Strabo argued for an ointment of some kind.3353343
36 note 58 No venomous snake was found with her body but she did have tiny puncture wounds on her arm that could have been caused by a needle.333336332 Cleopatra decided in her last moments to send Caesarion away to Upper Egypt perhaps with plans to flee to Kushite Nubia Ethiopia or India.337338316 Caesarion now Ptolemy XV would reign for a mere 18 days until executed on the orders of Octavian on 29 August 30 BC after returning to Alexandria under the false pretense that Octavian would allow him to be king.3393403

Following the tradition of Macedonian rulers Cleopatra ruled Egypt and other territories such as Cyprus as an absolute monarch serving as the sole lawgiver of her kingdom.348 She was the chief religious authority in her realm presiding over religious ceremonies dedicated to the deities of both the Egyptian and Greek polytheistic faiths.349 She oversaw the construction of various temples to Egyptian and Greek gods350 a synagogue for the Jews in Egypt and even built the Caesareum of Alexandria dedicated to the cult worship of her patron and lover Julius Caesar.351352 Cleopatra was directly involved in the administrative affairs of her domain353 tackling crises such as famine by ordering royal granaries to distribute food to the starving populace during a drought at the beginning of her reign.354 Although the command economy that she managed was more of an ideal than a reality355 the government attempted to impose price controls tariffs and state monopolies for certain goods fixed exchange rates for foreign currencies and rigid laws forcing peasant farmers to stay in their villages during planting and harvesting seasons.356357358 Apparent financial troubles led Cleopatra to debase her coinage which included silver and bronze currencies but no gold coins like those of some of her distant Ptolemaic predecessors.359 Legacy Children and successors Left A Roman head of either Cleopatra or her daughter Cleopatra Selene II Queen of Mauretania from the late

63 note 61 After her suicide Cleopatras three surviving children Cleopatra Selene II Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphos were sent to Rome with Octavians sister Octavia the Younger a former wife of their father as their guardian.364365 Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios were present in the Roman triumph of Octavian in 29 BC.364239 The fates of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus are unknown after this point.364239 Octavia arranged the betrothal of Cleopatra Selene II to Juba II son of Juba I whose North African kingdom of Numidia had been turned into a Roman province in 46 BC by Julius Caesar due to Juba Is support of Pompey.366365324 The emperor Augustus installed Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II after their wedding in 25 BC as the new rulers of Mauretania where they transformed the old Carthaginian city of Iol into their new capital renamed Caesarea Mauretaniae modern Cherchell Algeria.366239 Cleopatra Selene II imported many important scholars artists and advisers from her mothers royal court in Alexandria to serve her in Caesarea now permeated in Hellenistic Greek culture.367 She also named her son Ptolemy of Mauretania in honor of their Ptolemaic dynastic heritage.368369 Cleopatra Selene II died c.5 BC and when Juba II died in 2324 AD he was succeeded by his son Ptolemy.368370 However Ptolemy was eventually executed by the Roman emperor Caligula in 40 AD perhaps under the pretense that Ptolemy had unlawfully minted his own royal coinage and utilized regalia reserved for the Roman emperor.371372 Ptolemy of Mauretania was the last known monarch of the Ptolemaic dynasty although Queen Zenobia of the shortlived Palmyrene Empire during the Crisis of the Third Century claimed descent from Cleopatra.373374 A cult dedicated to Cleopatra still existed as late as 373 AD when Petesenufe an Egyptian scribe of the book of Isis explained that he overlaid the figure of Cleopatra with gold.375 Roman literature and historiography Further information Roman historiography Greek historiography Latin literature and Latin poetry Cleopatra Testing Poisons on Condemned Prisoners 1887 by Alexandre Cabanel376 Although almost 50 ancient works of Roman historiography mention Cleopatra these often include only terse accounts of the Battle of Actium her suicide and Augustan propaganda about her personal deficiencies.377 Despite not being a biography of Cleopatra the Life of Antonius written by Plutarch in the 
1 st century AD provides the most thorough surviving account of Cleopatras life.378379380 Plutarch lived a century after Cleopatra but relied on primary sources such as Philotas of Amphissa who had access to the Ptolemaic royal palace Cleopatras personal physician named Olympos and Quintus Dellius a close confidant of Mark Antony and Cleopatra.381 Plutarchs work included both the Augustan view of Cleopatrawhich became canonical for his periodas well as sources outside of this tradition such as eyewitness reports.378380 The Jewish Roman historian Josephus writing in the 
1 st century AD provides valuable information on the life of Cleopatra via her diplomatic relationship with Herod the Great.382383 However this work relies largely on Herods memoirs and the biased account of Nicolaus of Damascus the tutor of Cleopatras children in Alexandria before he moved to Judea to serve as an adviser and chronicler at Herods court.382383 The Roman History published by the official and historian Cassius Dio in the early 
3 rd century AD while failing to fully comprehend the complexities of the late Hellenistic world nevertheless provides a continuous history of the era of Cleopatras reign.382 A restructured marble Roman statue of Cleopatra wearing a diadem and melon hairstyle similar to coinage portraits found along the Via Cassia near the Tomba di Nerone it Rome and now located in the Museo PioClementino1384385 Cleopatra is barely mentioned in De Bello Alexandrino the memoirs of an unknown staff officer who served under Caesar.3863873
88 note 62 The writings of Cicero who knew her personally provide an unflattering portrait of Cleopatra.386 The Augustanperiod authors Virgil Horace Propertius and Ovid perpetuated the negative views of Cleopatra approved by the ruling Roman regime386389 although Virgil established the idea of Cleopatra as a figure of romance and epic melodrama.3
90 note 63 Horace also viewed Cleopatras suicide as a positive choice391389 an idea that found acceptance by the Late Middle Ages with Geoffrey Chaucer.392393 The historians Strabo Velleius Valerius Maximus Pliny the Elder and Appian while not offering accounts as full as Plutarch Josephus or Dio provided some details of her life that had not survived in other historical records.3
86 note 64 Inscriptions on contemporary Ptolemaic coinage and some Egyptian papyrus documents demonstrate Cleopatras point of view but this material is very limited in comparison to Roman literary works.3863
94 note 65 The fragmentary Libyka commissioned by Cleopatras soninlaw Juba II provides a glimpse at a possible body of historiographic material that supported Cleopatras perspective.386 Cleopatras gender has perhaps led to her depiction as a minor if not insignificant figure in ancient medieval and even modern historiography about ancient Egypt and the GrecoRoman world.395 For instance the historian Ronald Syme asserted that she was of little importance to Caesar and that the propaganda of Octavian magnified her importance to an excessive degree.395 Although the common view of Cleopatra was one of a prolific seductress she had only two known sexual partners Caesar and Antony the two most prominent Romans of the time period who were most likely to ensure the survival of her dynasty.396397 Plutarch described Cleopatra as having had a stronger personality and charming wit than physical beauty.398153

For instance there was once a large gilded bronze statue of Cleopatra inside the Temple of Venus Genetrix in Rome the first time that a living person had their statue placed next to that of a deity in a Roman temple.3185403 It was erected there by Caesar and remained in the temple at least until the 
3 rd century AD its preservation perhaps owing to Caesars patronage although Augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in Alexandria depicting Cleopatra.404405 A lifesized Romanstyle statue of Cleopatra was found near the Tomba di Nerone it Rome along the Via Cassia and is now housed in the Museo PioClementino part of the Vatican Museums.1384385 Plutarch in his Life of Antonius said that the public statues of Antony were torn down by Augustus but those of Cleopatra were preserved following her death thanks to her friend Archibius paying the emperor 2000 talents to dissuade him from destroying hers.406375331 Since the 19
50 s scholars have debated whether or not the Esquiline Venusdiscovered in 1874 on the Esquiline Hill in Rome and housed in the Palazzo dei Conservatori of the Capitoline Museumsis a depiction of Cleopatra based on the statues hairstyle and facial features apparent royal diadem worn over the head and the uraeus Egyptian cobra wrapped around the base.401407408 Detractors of this theory argue that the face in this statue is thinner than the face on the Berlin portrait and assert that it was unlikely she would be depicted as the naked goddess Venus or the Greek Aphrodite.401407408 However she was depicted in an Egyptian statue as the goddess Isis409 while some of her coinage depicts her as VenusAphrodite.410411 She also dressed as Aphrodite when meeting Antony at Tarsos.206 The Esquiline Venus is generally thought to be a mid
1 stcentury AD Roman copy of a 
1 stcentury BC Greek original from the school of Pasiteles.407 Coinage portraits Further information Ptolemaic coinage Roman currency and Ancient Greek coinage Cleopatra and Mark Antony on the obverse and reverse respectively of a silver tetradrachm struck at the Antioch mint in 36 BC with Greek legends BACICCA K   ANTNIOC AYTOKPATP TPITON TPIN ANPN. Surviving coinage of Cleopatras reign include specimens from every regnal year from 51 to 30 BC.412 Cleopatra the only Ptolemaic queen to issue coins on her own behalf almost certainly inspired her partner Caesar to become the first living Roman to present his portrait on his own coins.4
10 note 67 Cleopatra was the first foreign queen to have her image appear on Roman currency.413 Coins dated to the period of her marriage to Antony which also bear his image portray the queen as having a very similar aquiline nose and prominent chin as that of her husband.3414 These similar facial features followed an artistic convention that represented the mutuallyobserved harmony of a royal couple.32 Her strong almost masculine facial features in these particular coins are strikingly different from the smoother softer and perhaps idealized sculpted images of her in either the Egyptian or Hellenistic styles.2415416 Her masculine facial features on minted currency are similar to that of her father Ptolemy XII Auletes417115 and perhaps also to those of her Ptolemaic ancestor Arsinoe II 316260 BC2418 and even depictions of earlier queens such as Hatshepsut and Nefertiti.416 It is likely due to political expediency that Antonys visage was made to conform not only to hers but also to those of her Macedonian Greek ancestors who founded the Ptolemaic dynasty to familiarize himself to her subjects as a legitimate member of the royal house.2 The inscriptions on the coins are written in Greek but also in the nominative case of Roman coins rather than the genitive case of Greek coins in addition to having the letters placed in a circular fashion along the edges of the coin instead of across it horizontally or vertically as was customary for Greek ones.2 These facets of their coinage represent the synthesis of Roman and Hellenistic culture and perhaps also a statement to their subjects however ambiguous to modern scholars about the superiority of either Antony or Cleopatra over the other.2 Diana Kleiner argues that Cleopatra in one of her coins minted with the dual image of her husband Antony made herself more masculinelooking than other portraits and more like an acceptable Roman client queen than a Hellenistic ruler.415 Cleopatra had actually achieved this masculine look in coinage predating her affair with Antony such as the coins struck at the Ascalon mint during her brief period of exile to Syria and the Levant which Joann Fletcher explains as her attempt to appear like her father and as a legitimate successor to a male Ptolemaic ruler.115419 Various coins such as a silver tetradrachm minted sometime after Cleopatras marriage with Antony in 37 BC depict her wearing a royal diadem and a melon hairstyle.3419 The combination of this hairstyle with a diadem is also featured in two surviving sculpted marble heads.4203764
21 note 68 This hairstyle with hair braided back into a bun is the same as that worn by her Ptolemaic ancestors Arsinoe II and Berenice II in their own coinage.3422 After her visit to Rome in 4644 BC it became fashionable for Roman women to adopt it as one of their hairstyles but it was abandoned for a more modest austere look during the conservative rule of Augustus.3420421 GrecoRoman busts and heads An ancient Roman portrait head c.5030 BC now located in the British Museum London that depicts a woman from Ptolemaic Egypt either Queen Cleopatra or a member of her entourage during her 4644 BC visit to Rome with her lover Julius Caesar420 Of the surviving GrecoRomanstyle busts and heads of Cleopatranote 69 the sculpture known as the Berlin Cleopatra located in the Antikensammlung Berlin collection at the Altes Museum possesses her full nose whereas the head known as the Vatican Cleopatra located in the Vatican Museums is damaged with a missing nose.4234244
25 note 70 Both the Berlin Cleopatra and Vatican Cleopatra have royal diadems similar facial features and perhaps once resembled the face of her bronze statue housed in the Temple of Venus Genetrix.4244264
25 note 71 Both heads are dated to the mid
1 st century BC and were found in Roman villas along the Via Appia in Italy the Vatican Cleopatra having been unearthed in the Villa of the Quintilii.34234
25 note 72 Francisco Pina Polo writes that Cleopatras coinage present her image with certainty and asserts that the sculpted portrait of the Berlin head is confirmed as having a similar profile with her hair pulled back into a bun a diadem and a hooked nose.4
27 note 73 A third sculpted portrait of Cleopatra accepted by scholars as being authentic survives at the Archaeological Museum of Cherchell Algeria.405360361 This portrait features the royal diadem and similar facial features as the Berlin and Vatican heads but has a more unique hairstyle and may actually depict Cleopatra Selene II daughter of Cleopatra.3614282
33 note 50 A possible Parianmarble sculpture of Cleopatra wearing a vulture headdress in Egyptian style is located at the Capitoline Museums.429 Discovered near a sanctuary of Isis in Rome and dated to the 
1 st century BC it is either Roman or HellenisticEgyptian in origin.430 Other possible sculpted depictions of Cleopatra include one in the British Museum London made of limestone which perhaps only depicts a woman in her entourage during her trip to Rome.1420 The woman in this portrait has facial features similar to others including the pronounced aquiline nose but lacks a royal diadem and sports a different hairstyle.1420 However the British Museum head once belonging to a full statue could potentially represent Cleopatra at a different stage in her life and may also betray an effort by Cleopatra to discard the use of royal insignia i.e. the diadem to make herself more appealing to the citizens of Republican Rome.420 Duane W. Roller speculates that the British Museum head along with those in the Egyptian Museum Cairo the Capitoline Museums and in the private collection of Maurice Nahmen while having similar facial features and hairstyles as the Berlin portrait but lacking a royal diadem most likely represent members of the royal court or even Roman women imitating Cleopatras popular hairstyle.431 Cleopatra mid

1 st century BC407432 In the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii Italy a mid
1 st century BC Second Style wall painting of the goddess Venus holding a cupid near massive temple doors is most likely a depiction of Cleopatra as Venus Genetrix with her son Caesarion.407432 The commission of the painting most likely coincides with the erection of the Temple of Venus Genetrix in the Forum of Caesar in September 46 BC where Caesar had a gilded statue erected depicting Cleopatra.407432 This statue likely formed the basis of her depictions in both sculpted art as well as this painting at Pompeii.407433 The woman in the painting wears a royal diadem over her head and is strikingly similar in appearance to the Vatican Cleopatra which bears possible marks on the marble of its left cheek where a cupids arm may have been torn off.4074344
25 note 74 The room with the painting was walled off by its owner perhaps in reaction to the execution of Caesarion in 30 BC by order of Octavian when public depictions of Cleopatras son would have been unfavorable with the new Roman regime.407435 Behind her golden diadem crowned with a red jewel is a translucent veil with crinkles that suggest the melon hairstyle favored by the queen.4
34 note 75 Her ivorywhite skin round face long aquiline nose and large round eyes were features common in both Roman and Ptolemaic depictions of deities.434 Roller affirms that there seems little doubt that this is a depiction of Cleopatra and Caesarion before the doors of the Temple of Venus in the Forum Julium and as such it becomes the only extant contemporary painting of the queen.407 A steel engraving published by John Sartain in 1885 left depicting the now lost painted death portrait of Cleopatra an encaustic painting discovered in 1818 in the ancient Roman ruins of the Egyptian temple of Serapis at Hadrians Villa in Tivoli Lazio436 she is seen here wearing the knotted garment of Isis corresponding with Plutarchs description of her wearing the robes of Isis437 as well as the radiant crown of the Ptolemaic rulers such as Ptolemy V pictured to the right in a golden octodrachm minted in 204203 BC.438 Another painting from Pompeii dated to the early 
1 st century AD and located in the House of Giuseppe II contains a possible depiction of Cleopatra with her son Caesarion both wearing royal diadems while she reclines and consumes poison in an act of suicide.3013
02 note 76 The painting was originally thought to depict the Carthaginian noblewoman Sophonisba who toward the end of the Second Punic War 218201 BC drank poison and committed suicide at the behest of her lover Masinissa King of Numidia.301 Arguments in favor of it depicting Cleopatra include the strong connection of her house with that of the Numidian royal family Masinissa and Ptolemy VIII Physcon having been associates and Cleopatras own daughter marrying the Numidian prince Juba II.301 Sophonisba was also a more obscure figure when the painting was made while Cleopatras suicide was far more famous.301 An asp is absent from the painting but many Romans held the view that she received poison in another manner than a venomous snakebite.439 A set of double doors on the rear wall of the painting positioned very high above the people in it suggests the described layout of Cleopatras tomb in Alexandria.301 A male servant holds the mouth of an artificial Egyptian crocodile possibly an elaborate tray handle while another man standing by is dressed as a Roman.301 In 1818 a now lost encaustic painting was discovered in the Temple of Serapis at Hadrians Villa near Tivoli Lazio Italy that depicted Cleopatra committing suicide with an asp biting her bare chest.436 A chemical analysis performed in 1822 confirmed that the medium for the painting was composed of onethird wax and twothirds resin.436 The thickness of the painting over Cleopatras bare flesh and her drapery were reportedly similar to the paintings of the Fayum mummy portraits.440 A steel engraving published by John Sartain in 1885 depicting the painting as described in the archaeological report shows Cleopatra wearing authentic clothing and jewelry of Egypt in the late Hellenistic period441 as well as the radiant crown of the Ptolemaic rulers as seen in their portraits on various coins minted during their respective reigns.438 After Cleopatras suicide Octavian commissioned a painting to be made depicting her being bitten by a snake parading this image in her stead during his triumphal procession in Rome.440337313 The portrait painting of Cleopatras death was perhaps among the great number of artworks and treasures taken from Rome by Emperor Hadrian to decorate his private villa where it was found in an Egyptian temple.4
36 note 77 An ancient Roman fresco in the Pompeian Third Style possibly depicting Cleopatra from the House of the Orchard at Pompeii Italy mid
1 st century AD47 A Roman panel painting from Herculaneum Italy dated to the 
1 st century AD possibly depicts Cleopatra.4748 In it she wears a royal diadem red or reddishbrown hair pulled back into a bunnote 78 pearlstudded hairpins442 and earrings with ballshaped pendants the white skin of her face and neck set against a stark black background.47 Her hair and facial features are similar to those in the sculpted Berlin and Vatican portraits as well as her coinage.47 A highly similar painted bust of a woman with a blue headband in the House of the Orchard at Pompeii features Egyptianstyle imagery such as a Greekstyle sphinx and may have been created by the same artist.47 Portland Vase Further information Portland Vase A possible depiction of Mark Antony on the Portland Vase being lured by Cleopatra straddling a serpent while Anton Antonys alleged ancestor looks on and Eros flies above443444 The Portland Vase a Roman cameo glass vase dated to the Augustan period and now in the British Museum includes a possible depiction of Cleopatra with Antony.443445 In this interpretation Cleopatra can be seen grasping Antony and drawing him toward her while a serpent i.e. the asp rises between her legs Eros floats above and Anton the alleged ancestor of the Antonian family looks on in despair as his descendant Antony is led to his doom.443444 The other side of the vase perhaps contains a scene of Octavia abandoned by her husband Antony but watched over by her brother the emperor Augustus.443444 The vase would thus have been created no earlier than 35 BC when Antony sent his wife Octavia back to Italy and stayed with Cleopatra in Alexandria.443 Native Egyptian art Further information Portraiture in ancient Egypt and Reign of Cleopatra  Egypt under the monarchy of Cleopatra A carved relief of Cleopatra and her son Caesarion at the Temple of Dendera Egypt 
1 st century BC The Bust of Cleopatra in the Royal Ontario Museum represents a bust of Cleopatra in the Egyptian style.446 Dated to the mid
1 st century BC it is perhaps the earliest depiction of Cleopatra as both a goddess and ruling pharaoh of Egypt.446 The sculpture also has pronounced eyes that share similarities with Roman copies of Ptolemaic sculpted works of art.447 The Dendera Temple complex near Dendera Egypt contains Egyptianstyle carved relief images along the exterior walls of the Temple of Hathor depicting Cleopatra and her young son Caesarion as a grown adult and ruling pharaoh making offerings to the gods.448449 Augustus had his name inscribed there following the death of Cleopatra.448450 A large Ptolemaic black basalt statue measuring 104 centimetres 41 in in height now in the Hermitage Museum Saint Petersburg is thought to represent Arsinoe II wife of Ptolemy II but recent analysis has indicated that it could depict her descendant Cleopatra due to the three uraei adorning her headdress an increase from the two used by Arsinoe II to symbolize her rule over Lower and Upper Egypt.406402400 The woman in the basalt statue also holds a divided double cornucopia dikeras which can be seen on coins of both Arsinoe II and Cleopatra.406400 In his Kleopatra und die Caesaren 2006 Bernard Andreae de contends that this basalt statue like other idealized Egyptian portraits of the queen does not contain realistic facial features and hence adds little to the knowledge of her appearance.4
51 note 79 Adrian Goldsworthy writes that despite these representations in the traditional Egyptian style Cleopatra would have dressed as a native only perhaps for certain rites and instead would usually dress as a Greek monarch which would include the Greek headband seen in her GrecoRoman busts.452 A granite Egyptian bust of Cleopatra from the Royal Ontario Museum mid

14 thcentury English poet Geoffrey Chaucer in The Legend of Good Women contextualized Cleopatra for the Christian world of the Middle Ages.457 His depiction of Cleopatra and Antony her shining knight engaged in courtly love has been interpreted in modern times as being either playful or misogynistic satire.457 Chaucer highlighted Cleopatras relationships with only two men as hardly the life of a seductress and wrote his works partly in reaction to the negative depiction of Cleopatra in De Mulieribus Claris and De Casibus Virorum Illustrium Latin works by the 
14 thcentury Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio.458393 The Renaissance humanist Bernardino Cacciante it in his 1504 Libretto apologetico delle donne was the first Italian to defend the reputation of Cleopatra and criticize the perceived moralizing and misogyny in Boccaccios works.459 Works of Islamic historiography written in Arabic covered the reign of Cleopatra such as the 
10 thcentury Meadows of Gold by AlMasudi460 although his work erroneously claimed that Octavian died soon after Cleopatras suicide.461 Cleopatra appeared in miniatures for illuminated manuscripts such as a depiction of her and Antony lying in a Gothicstyle tomb by the Boucicaut Master in 14
09.3 92 In the visual arts the sculpted depiction of Cleopatra as a freestanding nude figure committing suicide began with the 
16 thcentury sculptors Bartolommeo Bandinelli and Alessandro Vittoria.462 Early prints depicting Cleopatra include designs by the Renaissance artists Raphael and Michelangelo as well as 
15 thcentury woodcuts in illustrated editions of Boccaccios works.463 In the performing arts the death of Elizabeth I of England in 1603 and the German publication in 1606 of alleged letters of Cleopatra inspired Samuel Daniel to alter and republish his 1594 play Cleopatra in 16
07.4 64 He was followed by William Shakespeare whose Antony and Cleopatra largely based on Plutarch was first performed in 1608 and provided a somewhat salacious view of Cleopatra in stark contrast to Englands own Virgin Queen.465 Cleopatra was also featured in operas such as George Frideric Handels 1724 Giulio Cesare in Egitto which portrayed the love affair of Caesar and Cleopatra466 Domenico Cimarosa wrote Cleopatra on a similar subject in 17
89.4 67 Modern depictions and brand imaging Further information List of cultural depictions of Cleopatra and Egyptomania The Triumph of Cleopatra 1821 by William Etty now in the Lady Lever Art Gallery Port Sunlight England In Victorian Britain Cleopatra was highly associated with many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture and her image was used to market various household products including oil lamps lithographs postcards and cigarettes.468 Fictional novels such as H. Rider Haggards Cleopatra 1889 and Thophile Gautiers One of Cleopatras Nights 1838 depicted the queen as a sensual and mystic Easterner while the Egyptologist Georg Eberss Cleopatra 1894 was more grounded in historical accuracy.468469 The French dramatist Victorien Sardou and Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw produced plays about Cleopatra while burlesque shows such as F. C. Burnands Antony and Cleopatra offered satirical depictions of the queen connecting her and the environment she lived in with the modern age.470 Shakespeares Antony and Cleopatra was considered canonical by the Victorian era.471 Its popularity led to the perception that the 1885 painting by Lawrence AlmaTadema depicted the meeting of Antony and Cleopatra on her pleasure barge in Tarsus although AlmaTadema revealed in a private letter that it depicts a subsequent meeting of theirs in Alexandria.472 Also based on Shakespeares play was Samuel Barbers opera Antony and Cleopatra 1966 commissioned for the opening of the Metropolitan Opera House.473 In his unfinished 1825 short story The Egyptian Nights Alexander Pushkin popularized the claims of the 
4 thcentury Roman historian Aurelius Victor previously largely ignored that Cleopatra had prostituted herself to men who paid for sex with their lives.474475 Cleopatra also became appreciated outside the Western world and Middle East as the Qingdynasty Chinese scholar Yan Fu wrote an extensive biography of her.476 Georges Mliss Robbing Cleopatras Tomb French Cloptre an 1899 French silent horror film was the first film to depict the character of Cleopatra.477 Hollywood films of the 
20 th century were influenced by earlier Victorian media which helped to shape the character of Cleopatra played by Theda Bara in Cleopatra 1917 Claudette Colbert in Cleopatra 1934 and Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra 19
63.4 78 In addition to her portrayal as a vampire queen Baras Cleopatra also incorporated tropes familiar from 
19 thcentury Orientalist painting such as despotic behavior mixed with dangerous and overt female sexuality.479 Colberts character of Cleopatra served as a glamour model for selling Egyptianthemed products in department stores in the 19
30 s targeting female moviegoers.480 In preparation for the film starring Taylor as Cleopatra womens magazines of the early 19
60 s advertised how to use makeup clothes jewelry and hairstyles to achieve the Egyptian look similar to the queens Cleopatra and Nefertiti.481 By the end of the 
20 th century there were fortythree films two hundred plays and novels fortyfive operas and five ballets associated with Cleopatra.482 Written works Further information Ancient Greek literature and Ancient Egyptian literature Whereas myths about Cleopatra persist in popular media important aspects of her career go largely unnoticed such as her command of naval forces and administrative acts. Publications on ancient Greek medicine attributed to her are likely to be the work of a physician by the same name writing in the late first century AD.483 Ingrid D. Rowland who highlights that the Berenice called Cleopatra cited by the 
3 rd or 
4 thcentury female Roman physician Metrodora was likely conflated by medieval scholars as referring to Cleopatra.484 Only fragments exist of these medical and cosmetic writings such as those preserved by Galen including remedies for hair disease baldness and dandruff along with a list of weights and measures for pharmacological purposes.48518486 Atius of Amida attributed a recipe for perfumed soap to Cleopatra while Paul of Aegina preserved alleged instructions of hers for dyeing and curling hair.485 Ancestry See also Ethnicity of Cleopatra Left A Hellenistic bust of Ptolemy I Soter now in the Louvre Paris Right A bust of Seleucus I Nicator a Roman copy of a Greek original from the Villa of the Papyri Herculaneum and now in the National Archaeological Museum Naples A likely sculpture of Cleopatra V Tryphaena also known as Cleopatra VI

00 note 84 It is generally believed that the Ptolemies did not intermarry with native Egyptians.395
01 note 85 Michael Grant asserts that there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemy and no known Egyptian wife of a Ptolemy further arguing that Cleopatra probably did not have any Egyptian ancestry and would have described herself as Greek.4
97 note 86 Stacy Schiff writes that Cleopatra was a Macedonian Greek with some Persian ancestry arguing that it was rare for the Ptolemies to have an Egyptian mistress.5
02 note 87 Duane W. Roller speculates that Cleopatra could have been the daughter of a theoretical halfMacedonianGreek halfEgyptian woman from Memphis in northern Egypt belonging to a family of priests dedicated to Ptah a hypothesis not generally accepted in scholarshipnote 88 but contends that whatever Cleopatras ancestry she valued her Greek Ptolemaic heritage the most.5
03 note 89 Ernle Bradford writes that Cleopatra challenged Rome not as an Egyptian woman but as a civilized Greek.504 Claims that Cleopatra was an illegitimate child never appeared in Roman propaganda against her.345
05 note 90 Strabo was the only ancient historian who claimed that Ptolemy XIIs children born after Berenice IV including Cleopatra were illegitimate.34505506 Cleopatra V or VI was expelled from the court of Ptolemy XII in late 69 BC a few months after the birth of Cleopatra while Ptolemy XIIs three younger children were all born during the absence of his wife.40 The high degree of inbreeding among the Ptolemies is also illustrated by Cleopatras immediate ancestry of which a reconstruction is shown below.note 91 The family tree given below also lists Cleopatra V as a daughter of Ptolemy X Alexander I and Berenice III. This would make her a cousin of her husband Ptolemy XII but she could have been a daughter of Ptolemy IX Lathyros which would have made her a sisterwife of Ptolemy XII instead.50734 The confused accounts in ancient primary sources have also led scholars to number Ptolemy XIIs wife as either Cleopatra V or Cleopatra VI the latter may have actually been a daughter of Ptolemy XII. Fletcher and John Whitehorne assert that this is a possible indication Cleopatra V had died in 69 BC rather than reappearing as a coruler with Berenice IV in 58 BC during Ptolemy XIIs exile in Rome.56508 Ptolemy V Epiphanes Cleopatra I Syra Ptolemy VI Philometor Cleopatra II Ptolemy VIII Physcon Cleopatra III Cleopatra Selene of Syria Ptolemy IX Lathyros Cleopatra IV Ptolemy X Alexander I Berenice III Cleopatra V Tryphaena Ptolemy XII Auletes Cleopatra VII See also List of female hereditary monarchs Notes  The sculpture was made around the time of Cleopatras visits to Rome in 4644 BC and was discovered in an Italian villa along the Via Appia.

However Duane W. Roller relaying Theodore Cressy Skeat affirms that Caesarions reign was essentially a fiction created by Egyptian chronographers to close the gap between Cleopatras death and official Roman control of Egypt under the new pharaoh Octavian citing for instance the Stromata by Clement of Alexandria Roller 2010 pp. 149 214 footnote 103. Plutarch translated by Jones 2006 p. 187 wrote in vague terms that Octavian had Caesarion killed later after Cleopatras death.  a b c Grant 1972 pp. 34 17 Fletcher 2008 pp. 69 74 76 Jones 2006 p. xiii Preston 2009 p. 22 Schiff 2011 p. 28 and Burstein 2004 p. 11 label the wife of Ptolemy XII Auletes as Cleopatra V Tryphaena while Dodson  Hilton 2004 pp. 268269 273 and Roller 2010 p. 18 call her Cleopatra VI Tryphaena due to the confusion in primary sources conflating these two figures who may have been one and the same. As explained by Whitehorne 1994 p. 182 Cleopatra VI may have actually been a daughter of Ptolemy XII who appeared in 58 BC to rule jointly with her alleged sister Berenice IV while Ptolemy XII was exiled and living in Rome whereas Ptolemy XIIs wife Cleopatra V perhaps died as early as the winter of 6968 BC when she disappears from historical records. Roller 2010 pp. 1819 assumes that Ptolemy XIIs wife who he numbers as Cleopatra VI was merely absent from the court for a decade after being expelled for an unknown reason eventually ruling jointly with her daughter Berenice IV. Fletcher 2008 p. 76 explains that the Alexandrians deposed Ptolemy XII and installed his eldest daughter Berenike IV and as coruler recalled Cleopatra V Tryphaena from 10 years exile from the court. Although later historians assumed she must have been another of Auletes daughters and numbered her Cleopatra VI it seems she was simply the fifth one returning to replace her brother and former husband Auletes.  a b 12 August 30 BC in the later Julian calendar Skeat 1953 pp. 98100.

Michael Grant stresses that the Hellenistic Greeks were viewed by contemporary Romans as having declined and diminished in greatness since the age of Classical Greece an attitude that has continued even into the works of modern historiography. Regarding Hellenistic Egypt Grant argues Cleopatra VII looking back upon all that her ancestors had done during that time was not likely to make the same mistake. But she and her contemporaries of the first century BC had another peculiar problem of their own. Could the Hellenistic Age which we ourselves often regard as coming to an end in about her time still be said to exist at all could any Greek age now that the Romans were the dominant power This was a question never far from Cleopatras mind. But it is quite certain that she considered the Greek epoch to be by no means finished and intended to do everything in her power to ensure its perpetuation.  a b The refusal of Ptolemaic rulers to speak the native language Late Egyptian is why Ancient Greek i.e. Koine Greek was used along with Late Egyptian on official court documents such as the Rosetta Stone  Radio 4 Programmes  A History of the World in 100 Objects Empire Builders 300 BC  1 AD Rosetta Stone.

As explained by Burstein 2004 pp. 4354 Ptolemaic Alexandria was considered a polis citystate separate from the country of Egypt with citizenship reserved for Greeks and Ancient Macedonians but various other ethnic groups resided there especially the Jews as well as native Egyptians Syrians and Nubians.

Due to discrepancies in academic works in which some consider Cleopatra VI to be either a daughter of Ptolemy XII or his wife identical to that of Cleopatra V Jones 2006 p. 28 states that Ptolemy XII had six children while Roller 2010 p. 16 mentions only five.  Fletcher 2008 p. 87 describes the painting from Herculaneum further Cleopatras hair was maintained by her highly skilled hairdresser Eiras. Although rather artificial looking wigs set in the traditional tripartite style of long straight hair would have been required for her appearances before her Egyptian subjects a more practical option for general daytoday wear was the nononsense melon hairdo in which her natural hair was drawn back in sections resembling the lines on a melon and then pinned up in a bun at the back of the head. A trademark style of Arsinoe II and Berenice II the style had fallen from fashion for almost two centuries until revived by Cleopatra yet as both traditionalist and innovator she wore her version without her predecessors fine head veil. And whereas they had both been blonde like Alexander Cleopatra may well have been a redhead judging from the portrait of a flamehaired woman wearing the royal diadem surrounded by Egyptian motifs which has been identified as Cleopatra.  For further information and validation see Grant 1972 pp. 1213. In 1972 Michael Grant calculated that 6000 talents the price of Ptolemy XIIs fee for receiving the title friend and ally of the Roman people from the triumvirs Pompey and Julius Caesar would be worth roughly 7 million or US17 million roughly the entire annual tax revenue for Ptolemaic Egypt.

Fletcher 2008 pp. 7677 expresses little doubt about this deposed in late summer 58 BC and fearing for his life Auletes had fled both his palace and his kingdom although he was not completely alone. For one Greek source reveals he had been accompanied by one of his daughters and since his eldest Berenice IV was monarch and the youngest Arsinoe little more than a toddler it is generally assumed that this must have been his middle daughter and favourite child elevenyearold Cleopatra.

It is disputed whether Cleopatra was deliberately depicted as a male or whether a stele made under her father with his portrait was later inscribed with an inscription for Cleopatra. On this and other uncertainties regarding this stele see Pfeiffer 2015 pp. 177181.  For further information see Fletcher 2008 pp. 8892 and Jones 2006 pp. 31 3435. Fletcher 2008 pp. 8586 states that the partial solar eclipse of 7 March 51 BC marked the death of Ptolemy XII and accession of Cleopatra to the throne although she apparently suppressed the news of his death alerting the Roman Senate to this fact months later in a message they received on 30 June 51 BC. However Grant 1972 p. 30 claims that the Senate was informed of his death on 1 August 51 BC. Michael Grant indicates that Ptolemy XII could have been alive as late as May while an ancient Egyptian source affirms he was still ruling with Cleopatra by 15 July 51 BC although by this point Cleopatra most likely hushed up her fathers death so that she could consolidate her control of Egypt.  Pfrommer  TowneMarkus 2001 p. 34 writes the following about the sibling marriage of Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II Ptolemy Keraunos who wanted to become king of Macedon ... killed Arsinos small children in front of her. Now queen without a kingdom Arsino fled to Egypt where she was welcomed by her full brother Ptolemy II. Not content however to spend the rest of her life as a guest at the Ptolemaic court she had Ptolemy IIs wife exiled to Upper Egypt and married him herself around 275 B.C. Though such an incestuous marriage was considered scandalous by the Greeks it was allowed by Egyptian custom. For that reason the marriage split public opinion into two factions. The loyal side celebrated the couple as a return of the divine marriage of Zeus and Hera whereas the other side did not refrain from profuse and obscene criticism. One of the most sarcastic commentators a poet with a very sharp pen had to flee Alexandria. The unfortunate poet was caught off the shore of Crete by the Ptolemaic navy put in an iron basket and drowned. This and similar actions seemingly slowed down vicious criticism.

As part of the siege of Alexandria Burstein 2004 p. 19 states that Caesars reinforcements came in January but Roller 2010 p. 63 says that his reinforcements came in March.  For further information and validation see Anderson 2003 p. 39 and Fletcher 2008 p. 120.  For further information and validation see Fletcher 2008 p. 121 and Jones 2006 p. xiv. Roller 2010 pp. 6465 states that at this point 47 BC Ptolemy XIV was 12 years old while Burstein 2004 p. 19 claims that he was still only 10 years of age.  For further information and validation see Anderson 2003 p. 39 and Fletcher 2008 pp. 154 161162.  Roller 2010 p. 70 writes the following about Caesar and his parentage of Caesarion The matter of parentage became so tangled in the propaganda war between Antonius and Octavian in the late 
30 s B.C.it was essential for one side to prove and the other to reject Caesars rolethat it is impossible today to determine Caesars actual response. The extant information is almost contradictory it was said that Caesar denied parentage in his will but acknowledged it privately and allowed the use of the name Caesarion. Caesars associate C. Oppius even wrote a pamphlet proving that Caesarion was not Caesars child and C. Helvius Cinnathe poet who was killed by rioters after Antonius funeral orationwas prepared in 44 B.C. to introduce legislation to allow Caesar to marry as many wives as he wished for the purpose of having children. Although much of this talk was generated after Caesars death it seems that he wished to be as quiet as possible about the child but had to contend with Cleopatras repeated assertions.  For further information and validation see Jones 2006 pp. xiv 78.  For further information see Fletcher 2008 pp. 214215.  As explained by Burstein 2004 p. 23 Cleopatra having read Antonys personality boldly presented herself to him as the Egyptian goddess Isis in the appearance of the Greek goddess Aphrodite meeting her divine husband Osiris in the form of the Greek god Dionysus knowing that the priests of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus had associated Antony with Dionysus shortly before this encounter. According to Brown 2011 a cult surrounding Isis had been spreading across the region for hundreds of years and Cleopatra like many of her predecessors sought to identify herself with Isis and be venerated. In addition some surviving coins of Cleopatra also depict her as VenusAphrodite as explained by Fletcher 2008 p. 205.  For further information about Publius Ventidius Bassus and his victory over Parthian forces at the Battle of Mount Gindarus see Kennedy 1996 pp. 8081.  a b c Ferroukhi 20
01 a p. 219 provides a detailed discussion about this bust and its ambiguities noting that it could represent Cleopatra but that it is more likely her daughter Cleopatra Selene II. Kleiner 2005 pp. 155156 argues in favor of its depicting Cleopatra rather than her daughter while Varner 2004 p. 20 mentions only Cleopatra as a possible likeness. Roller 2003 p. 139 observes that it could be either Cleopatra or Cleopatra Selene II while arguing the same ambiguity applies to the other sculpted head from Cherchel featuring a veil. In regards to the latter head Ferroukhi 20
01 b p. 242 indicates it as a possible portrait of Cleopatra not Cleoptra Selene II from the early 
1 st century AD while also arguing that its masculine features earrings and apparent toga the veil being a component of it could likely mean it was intended to depict a Numidian nobleman. Fletcher 2008 image plates between pp. 246247 disagrees about the veiled head arguing that it was commissioned by Cleopatra Selene II at Iol Caesarea Mauretaniae and was meant to depict her mother Cleopatra.  According to Roller 2010 pp. 9192 these client state rulers installed by Antony included Herod Amyntas of Galatia Polemon I of Pontus and Archelaus of Cappadocia.  Bringmann 2007 p. 301 claims that Octavia Minor provided Antony with 1200 troops not 2000 as stated in Roller 2010 pp. 9798 and Burstein 2004 pp. 2728.  Roller 2010 p. 100 says that it is unclear if Antony and Cleopatra were ever truly married. Burstein 2004 pp. xxii 29 says that the marriage publicly sealed Antonys alliance with Cleopatra and in defiance of Octavian he would divorce Octavia in 32 BC. Coins of Antony and Cleopatra depict them in the typical manner of a Hellenistic royal couple as explained by Roller 2010 p. 100.  Jones 2006 p. xiv writes that Octavian waged a propaganda war against Antony and Cleopatra stressing Cleopatras status as a woman and a foreigner who wished to share in Roman power.  Stanley M. Burstein in Burstein 2004 p. 33 provides the name Quintus Cascellius as the recipient of the tax exemption not the Publius Canidius Crassus provided by Duane W. Roller in Roller 2010 p. 134.  Reece 2017 p. 203 notes that the fragmentary texts of ancient Greek papyri do not often make their way into the modern public arena but this one has and with fascinating results while remaining almost entirely unacknowledged is the remarkable fact that Cleopatras oneword subscription contains a blatant spelling error  with a superfluous iota adscript. This spelling error has not been noted by the popular media however being simply transliterated ... including without comment the superfluous iota adscript p. 208. Even in academic sources the misspelling was largely unacknowledged or quietly corrected pp. 206208 210. Although described as normal orthography in contrast with correct orthography by Peter van Minnen p. 208 the spelling error is much rarer and more puzzling than the sort one would expect from the Greek papyri from Egypt p. 2
10 so rare in fact that it occurs only twice in the 70000 Greek papyri between the 
3 rd century BC and 
8 th century AD in the Papyrological Navigators database. This is especially so when considering it was added to a word with no etymological or morphological reason for having an iota adscript p. 210 and was written by the welleducated native Greekspeaking queen of Egypt Cleopatra VII p. 208.  As explained by Jones 2006 p. 147 politically Octavian had to walk a fine line as he prepared to engage in open hostilities with Antony. He was careful to minimize associations with civil war as the Roman people had already suffered through many years of civil conflict and Octavian could risk losing support if he declared war on a fellow citizen.  For the translated accounts of both Plutarch and Dio Jones 2006 pp. 194195 writes that the implement used to puncture Cleopatras skin was a hairpin.  Jones 2006 p. 187 translating Plutarch quotes Arius Didymus as saying to Octavian that it is not good to have too many Caesars which was apparently enough to convince Octavian to have Caesarion killed.  Contrary to regular Roman provinces Egypt was established by Octavian as territory under his personal control barring the Roman Senate from intervening in any of its affairs and appointing his own equestrian governors of Egypt the first of whom was Gallus. For further information see Southern 2014 p. 185 and Roller 2010 p. 151.  Walker 2001 p. 312 writes the following about the raised relief on the gilded silver dish Conspicuously mounted on the cornucopia is a gilded crescent moon set on a pine cone. Around it are piled pomegranates and bunches of grapes. Engraved on the horn are images of Helios the sun in the form of a youth dressed in a short cloak with the hairstyle of Alexander the Great the head surrounded by rays ... The symbols on the cornucopia can indeed be read as references to the Ptolemaic royal house and specifically to Cleopatra Selene represented in the crescent moon and to her twin brother Alexander Helios whose eventual fate after the conquest of Egypt is unknown. The viper seems to be linked with the pantheress and the intervening symbols of fecundity rather than the suicide of Cleopatra VII. The elephant scalp could refer to Cleopatra Selenes status as ruler with Juba II of Mauretania. The visual correspondence with the veiled head from Cherchel encourages this identification and many of the symbols used on the dish also appear on the coinage of Juba II.  Jones 2006 p. 60 offers speculation that the author of De Bello Alexandrino written in Latin prose sometime between 46 and 43 BC was a certain Aulus Hirtius a military officer serving under Caesar.  Burstein 2004 p. 30 writes that Virgil in his Aeneid described the Battle of Actium against Cleopatra as a clash of civilizations in which Octavian and the Roman gods preserved Italy from conquest by Cleopatra and the barbaric animalheaded gods of Egypt.  For further information and extracts of Strabos account of Cleopatra in his Geographica see Jones 2006 pp. 2830.  As explained by Chauveau 2000 pp. 23 this source material from Egypt dated to the reign of Cleopatra includes about 50 papyri documents in Ancient Greek mostly from the city of Heracleopolis and only a few papyri from Faiyum written in the Demotic Egyptian language. Overall this is a much smaller body of surviving native texts than those of any other period of Ptolemaic Egypt.  For the description of Cleopatra by Plutarch who claimed that her beauty was not completely incomparable but that she had a captivating and stimulating personality see Jones 2006 pp. 3233.  Fletcher 2008 p. 205 writes the following Cleopatra was the only female Ptolemy to issue coins on her own behalf some showing her as VenusAphrodite. Caesar now followed her example and taking the same bold step became the first living Roman to appear on coins his rather haggard profile accompanied by the title Parens Patriae Father of the Fatherland.  For further information see Raia  Sebesta 2017.  There is academic disagreement on whether the following portraits are considered heads or busts. For instance Raia  Sebesta 2017 exclusively uses the former while Grout 20
17 b prefers the latter.  For further information and validation see Curtius 1933 pp. 182192 Walker 2008 p. 348 Raia  Sebesta 2017 and Grout 20

Blaise Pascal remarked in his Penses 1670 Cleopatras nose had it been shorter the whole aspect of the world would have been altered. Pascal 1910 sec. II no. 162 According to Perry  Williams 2019 a less aquiline nose would have diminished her chances of becoming ruler of Egypt and attract men of the First and Second Triumvirate which would have changed the Battle of Actium and subsequent European history.  The observation that the left cheek of the Vatican Cleopatra once had a cupids hand that was broken off was first suggested by Ludwig Curtius in 1933. Kleiner concurs with this assessment. See Kleiner 2005 p. 153 as well as Walker 2008 p. 40 and Curtius 1933 pp. 182192. While Kleiner 2005 p. 153 has suggested the lump on top of this marble head perhaps contained a brokenoff uraeus Curtius 1933 p. 187 offered the explanation that it once held a sculpted representation of a jewel.  Curtius 1933 p. 187 wrote that the damaged lump along the hairline and diadem of the Vatican Cleopatra likely contained a sculpted representation of a jewel which Walker 2008 p. 40 directly compares to the painted red jewel in the diadem worn by Venus most likely Cleopatra in the fresco from Pompeii.  For further information about the painting in the House of Giuseppe II Joseph II at Pompeii and the possible identification of Cleopatra as one of the figures see Pucci 2011 pp. 206207 footnote 27.  In Pratt  Fizel 1949 pp. 1415 Frances Pratt and Becca Fizel rejected the idea proposed by some scholars in the 
19 th and early 
20 th centuries that the painting was perhaps done by an artist of the Italian Renaissance. Pratt and Fizel highlighted the Classical style of the painting as preserved in textual descriptions and the steel engraving. They argued that it was unlikely for a Renaissance period painter to have created works with encaustic materials conducted thorough research into Hellenistic period Egyptian clothing and jewelry as depicted in the painting and then precariously placed it in the ruins of the Egyptian temple at Hadrians Villa.  Walker  Higgs 2001 pp. 314315 describe her hair as reddish brown while Fletcher 2008 p. 87 describes her as a flamehaired redhead and in Fletcher 2008 image plates and captions between pp. 246247 likewise describes her as a redhaired woman.  Preston 2009 p. 305 comes to a similar conclusion about native Egyptian depictions of Cleopatra Apart from certain temple carvings which are anyway in a highly stylised pharaonic style and give little clue to Cleopatras real appearance the only certain representations of Cleopatra are those on coins. The marble head in the Vatican is one of three sculptures generally though not universally accepted by scholars to be depictions of Cleopatra.  For further information on Cleopatras Macedonian Greek lineage see Pucci 2011 p. 201 Grant 1972 pp. 35 Burstein 2004 pp. 3 34 36 43 6364 and Royster 2003 pp. 4749.  For further information and validation of the foundation of Hellenistic Egypt by Alexander the Great and Cleopatras ancestry stretching back to Ptolemy I Soter see Grant 1972 pp. 78 and Jones 2006 p. 3.  For further information see Grant 1972 pp. 34 and Burstein 2004 p. 11.  For further information see Fletcher 2008 pp. 69 74 76. Contrary to other sources cited here Dodson  Hilton 2004 pp. 268269 273 refer to Cleopatra V Tryphaena as a possible cousin or sister of Ptolemy XII Auletes.  For the Sogdian ancestry of Apama wife of Seleucus I Nicator see Holt 1989 pp. 6465 footnote 63.  As explained by Burstein 2004 pp. 4750 the main ethnic groups of Ptolemaic Egypt were Egyptians Greeks and Jews each of whom were legally segregated living in different residential quarters and forbidden to intermarry with one another in the multicultural cities of Alexandria Naucratis and Ptolemais Hermiou. It had been speculated in some circles that Pasherienptah III the High Priest of Ptah at Memphis Egypt was Cleopatras halfcousin speculation which has been recently refuted by Cheshire 2011 pp. 2030.  Grant 1972 p. 5 argues that Cleopatras grandmother i.e. the mother of Ptolemy XII might have been a Syrian though conceding that it is possible she was also partly Greek but almost certainly not an Egyptian because there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemaic ruler throughout their entire dynasty.  Schiff 2011 p. 42 further argues that considering Cleopatras ancestry she was not darkskinned though notes Cleopatra was likely not among the Ptolemies with fair features and instead would have been honeyskinned citing as evidence that her relatives were described as such and it would have presumably applied to her as well. Goldsworthy 2010 pp. 127 128 agrees to this contending that Cleopatra having Macedonian blood with a little Syrian was probably not darkskinned as Roman propaganda never mentions it writing fairer skin is marginally more likely considering her ancestry though also notes she could have had a darker more Mediterranean complexion because of her mixed ancestry. Grant 1972 p. 5 agrees to Goldsworthys latter speculation of her skin color that though almost certainly not Egyptian Cleopatra had a darker complexion due to being Greek mixed with Persian and possible Syrian ancestry. Preston 2009 p. 77 agrees with Grant that considering this ancestry Cleopatra was almost certainly darkhaired and oliveskinned. Bradford 2000 p. 14 contends that it is reasonable to infer Cleopatra had dark hair and pale olive skin.  For further information on the identity of Cleopatras mother see Burstein 2004 p. 11 Fletcher 2008 p. 73 Goldsworthy 2010 pp. 127 128 Grant 1972 p. 4 Roller 2010 pp. 165166 and Bennett 1997 pp. 3966. Joann Fletcher finds this hypothesis to be dubious and lacking evidence. Stanley M. Burstein claims that strong circumstantial evidence suggests Cleopatras mother could have been a member of the priestly family of Ptah but that historians generally assume her mother was Cleopatra V Tryphaena wife of Ptolemy XII. Adrian Goldsworthy dismisses the idea of Cleopatras mother being a member of an Egyptian priestly family as pure conjecture adding that either Cleopatra V or a concubine probably of Greek origin would be Cleopatra VIIs mother. Michael Grant contends that Cleopatra V was most likely Cleopatra VIIs mother. Duane W. Roller notes that while Cleopatra could have been the daughter of the priestly family of Ptah the other main candidate would be Cleopatra VI maintaining the uncertainty stems from Cleopatra VVIs loss of favor that obscured the issue. He also posits that Cleopatra being the only known ruler of the Ptolemaic Dynasty to speak Egyptian along with her daughter Cleopatra Selene II as Queen of Mauretania publicly honoring the native Egyptian elite both lend credence to the priestly class mistress hypothesis for maternity. Christopher Bennett points out that with Cleopatra VII having a birthdate of 69 BC she was certainly conceived before Cleopatra V disappears from the record and thus it follows that Cleopatra V had to be the mother of Cleopatra VII. He further argues that this fact alone among others he discusses is sufficient to dispose of the argument of a hypothetical Egyptian Memphite aristocrat as the mother of Cleopatra VII. Part of Bursteins and Rollers argument rests on a speculated earlier marriage between Psenptais II and a certain Berenice once argued to possibly be a daughter of Ptolemy VIII. However this speculation was refuted by Egyptologist Wendy Cheshire which was later validated by papyrologist Sandra Lippert. See Cheshire 2011 pp. 2030 and Lippert 2013 pp. 3348.  Schiff 2011 pp. 2 concurs with this concluding that Cleopatra upheld the family tradition. As noted by Dudley 1960 pp. 57 Cleopatra and her family were the successors to the native Pharaohs exploiting through a highly organized bureaucracy the great natural resources of the Nile Valley.  Grant 1972 p. 4 argues that if Cleopatra had been illegitimate her numerous Roman enemies would have revealed this to the world.  The family tree and short discussions of the individuals can be found in Dodson  Hilton 2004 pp. 268281. Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton refer to Cleopatra V as Cleopatra VI and Cleopatra Selene of Syria is called Cleopatra V Selene. Dotted lines in the chart below indicate possible but disputed parentage.
