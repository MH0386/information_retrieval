It is bordered by Iraq to the west and Turkey to the northwest Azerbaijan Armenia the Caspian Sea and Turkmenistan to the north Afghanistan to the east Pakistan to the southeast the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf to the south. With a mostly Persianethnic population of almost 90 million in an area of 1648195 km 636372 sq mi Iran ranks 
17 th globally in both geographic size and population. It is the sixthlargest country entirely in Asia the secondlargest in West Asia and one of the worlds most mountainous countries. Officially an Islamic republic Iran has a Muslimmajority population. The country is divided into five regions with 31 provinces. The nations capital and most populous city is Tehran with around 16 million people in its metropolitan area. Other major cities include Mashhad Isfahan Karaj and Shiraz. Iran is one of the worlds oldest civilizations beginning with the Elamites in the fourth millennium BC. It was first unified as a state by the Medes in the seventh century BC and reached its territorial height in the sixth century BC when Cyrus the Great founded the Achaemenid Empire one of the largest and most powerful empires in ancient history. Alexander the Great conquered the empire in the fourth century BC subsequently dividing Iran into several Hellenistic states. An Iranian rebellion established the Parthian Empire in the third century BC which was succeeded in the third century AD by the Sasanian Empire. Muslims conquered the region in the seventh century AD leading to Irans Islamization. Iran became a major centre of Islamic culture and learning and its culture language and customs spread across the Muslim world. A series of native Iranian Muslim dynasties ruled the country until the Seljuk and the Mongol conquests of the 
11 th to 
14 th centuries. In the 
16 th century the native Safavids reestablished a unified Iranian state with Twelver Shia Islam as the official religion marking the beginning of modern Iranian history. During the Afsharid Empire in the 
18 th century Iran was a leading world power though by the 
19 th century it had lost significant territory through a series of conflicts with the Russian Empire. The early 
20 th century saw the Persian Constitutional Revolution the establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty and efforts at modernization. Attempts to nationalize the countrys vast fossil fuel supply led to an AngloAmerican coup in 1953. After the Iranian Revolution the monarchy was overthrown in 1979 and the Islamic Republic of Iran was established by The Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini who became the countrys first supreme leader. The forces of Saddam Hussein invaded the Iranian province of Khuzestan in 1980 initiating the IranIraq War which by the end of it in 1988 became the longest conventional war of the 
20 th century. Iran is officially governed as an Islamic Republic with a presidential system albeit with ultimate authority vested in a supreme leader rahbar currently Ali Khamenei since Khomeinis death in 1989. The Iranian government has attracted criticism for its constraints and violations of human rights. Iran is a major regional and middle power due to its large reserves of fossil fuels including the worlds second largest natural gas supply third largest proven oil reserves its geopolitically significant location its military capabilities its regional influence and its role as the worlds focal point of Shia Islam. The Iranian economy is the worlds 
19 thlargest by PPP. It possesses the worlds 
14 th strongest military. Iran is a active and founding member of the United Nations the NAM the ECO the OIC and the OPEC. It is a full member of both the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and BRICS. Owing it to its long history and rich cultural legacy Iran is home to 27 UNESCO World Heritage Sites the 
10 th highest number in the world and ranks 
5 th globally in the number of inscriptions of Intangible Cultural Heritage or human treasures. Iran was the worlds third fastestgrowing tourism destination in 20
19.1 2 Etymology Main article Name of Iran The wellpreserved Inscription of Ardashir Babakan 224242 AD in Naqshe Rostam This is the figure of Mazdaworshipper the lord Ardashir King of Iran.13 The term Iran the land of the Aryans derives from Middle Persian rn first attested in a thirdcentury inscription at Naqshe Rostam with the accompanying Parthian inscription using Aryn in reference to the Iranians.14 The terms rn and Aryn are oblique plural forms of gentilic nouns r Middle Persian and ary Parthian both deriving from ProtoIranian language arya meaning Aryan i.e. of the Iranians1415 recognised as a derivative of ProtoIndoEuropean language aryo meaning one who assembles skilfully.16 According to Iranian mythology the name comes from Iraj a legendary king.17 Historically Iran has been referred to as Persia by the West due to the writings of Greek historians who referred to all of Iran as Perss Ancient Greek  meaning the land of the Persians.18192021 Persia is the Fars province in southwest Iran the countrys 
4 th largest province also known as Prs.2223 The Persian word Frs  derived from the earlier form Prs  which is in turn derived from Prs Old Persian . Due to the Fars historical importance2425 the term Persia originated from this province by the Greeks in around 550 BC26 and Westerners started to refer the entire country as Persia2728 until 1935 when Reza Pahlavi requested the international community to refer to the country by its native and original name Iran.2930 While the Iranians had been calling their nation Iran since at least 1000 BC and possibly earlier this name change was made so that the Western World would begin to refer to the country by the same name as its people.22 Today both Iran and Persia are used in cultural contexts while Iran remains mandatory in official state contexts.313233343536 The Persian pronunciation of Iran is in.

13 th century BC an ancient Elamite complex in Khuzestan built by UntashNapirisha. UNESCO World Heritage Site.40 The earliest attested archaeological artifacts in Iran confirm human presence since the Lower Palaeolithic.41 Irans Neanderthal artifacts have been found mainly in the Zagros region at sites such as Warwasi and Yafteh.424344 From the tenth to the seventh millennium BC early agricultural communities began to flourish in and around the Zagros region including Chogha Golan4546 Chogha Bonut4748 and Chogha Mish.49505152 The occupation of grouped hamlets in the area of Susa ranges from 4395 to 3490 BC.53 There are dozens of prehistoric sites across the Iranian Plateau pointing to the existence of ancient cultures and urban settlements in the fourth millennium BC.525455 During the Bronze Age the territory was home to several Iranian civilizations5657 including Elam Jiroft and Zayanderud. Elam the most prominent of these developed in the southwest alongside those in Mesopotamia and continued its existence until the emergence of the Iranian empires. The advent of writing in Elam was parallelled to Sumer the Elamite cuneiform developed beginning in the third millennium BC.58 Diverse artifacts from The Bronze Age huge structures from the Iron Age and various sites dating back to the Sassanid Parthian and Islamic eras indicated suitable conditions for human civilization over the past 8000 years in Piranshahr.5960 From the 
34 th to the 
20 th century BC northwestern Iran was part of the KuraAraxes culture which stretched into the neighbouring Caucasus and Anatolia. Ancient Iran Main articles Median Empire Achaemenid Empire Seleucid Empire Parthian Empire and Sasanian Empire By the second millennium BC the ancient Iranian peoples arrived in Iran from the Eurasian Steppe61 rivalling the native settlers of the plateau.6263 As the Iranians dispersed into the wider area of Greater Iran and beyond the plateau was dominated by Median Persian and Parthian tribes. The Ancient Iranian history began with the Elamite Empire in the fourth millennium BC in the far west and southwest of Iran stretching from the lowlands of Khuzestan and Ilam Province. In the Old Elamite period Middle Bronze Age Elam consisted of kingdoms on the Iranian plateau centered in Anshan and from the mid
2 nd millennium BC it was centered in Susa in the Khuzestan lowlands. Elam was part of the early urbanization of the Near East during the Chalcolithic period. From the late tenth to the late seventh century BC the Iranian peoples together with the preIranian kingdoms fell under the domination of the Assyrian Empire based in northern Mesopotamia.6465 Under king Cyaxares the Medes and Persians entered into an alliance with Babylonian ruler Nabopolassar as well as the fellow Iranian Scythians and Cimmerians and together they attacked the Assyrians. Civil war ravaged the Assyrian Empire between 616 and 605 BC freeing their respective peoples from three centuries of Assyrian rule.64 Ecbatana presentday Hamadan was chosen as the first capital of Iran by Deioces in 678 BC the founder of Medes Empire. The frequent interference of the Assyrians in Zagros led to the process of unifying the Median tribes by Deioces in 728 BC the foundation of the Median Empire and their capital Ecbatana unifying Iran as a nation and state for the first time in 625 BC.66 By 612 BC the Medes overthrow the declining Assyrian Empire in alliance with the Babylonians.67 This marked the end of the Kingdom of Urartu which was subsequently conquered and dissolved.6869 In 550 BC Cyrus the Great defeated the last Median king Astyages during the MedoPersian conflict conquering Median territories and establishing the Achaemenid Empire by unifying other citystates. Later conquests under Cyrus and his successors expanded the empire to include Lydia Babylon Egypt parts of the Balkans and Eastern Europe as well as lands to the west of the Indus and Oxus rivers. In 539 BC Persian forces defeated the Babylonian army at Opis marking the end of around four centuries of Mesopotamian domination of the region by conquering the NeoBabylonian Empire.7071 Persepolis the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire 550330 BC. It is one of the key Iranian Cultural Heritages. The Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent around the time of Darius the Great and Xerxes I. In 518 BC Persepolis was founded by Darius the Great as the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire which at its greatest extent was the largest empire the world had yet seen71 and it ruled over 44 of the worlds population.72 The Achaemenid Empire has been recognized for its imposition of a successful model of centralized bureaucratic administration its multicultural policy building complex infrastructure such as road systems and an organized postal system the use of official languages across its territories and the development of civil services including its possession of a large professional army. Its advancements inspired the implementation of similar styles of governance by later empires.73 In 334 BC Alexander the Great defeated the last Achaemenid king Darius III at the Battle of Issus and burned down Persepolis. Following the premature death of Alexander in 323 BC Iran fell under the control of the Seleucid Empire and divided into several Hellenistic states. Iran remained under the Seleucid occupation until 250247 BC when the native Parthians led by Arsaces I liberated the region of Parthia in northeast Iran and rebelled against the Seleucids founding the Parthian Empire. Parthians rose to become the main power in Iran and the centurylong geopolitical archrivalry between the Romans and the Parthians began culminating in the RomanParthian Wars. Mithridates I greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At its height the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates in what is now centraleastern Turkey to presentday Afghanistan and western Pakistan. The empire located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han dynasty of China became a center of trade and commerce. As the Parthians expanded westward they came into conflict with the Kingdom of Armenia and eventually the late Roman Republic. The Romans and Parthians competed with each other to establish the kings of Armenia as their subordinate clients. After nearly five centuries of Parthian rule frequent civil wars between Parthian contenders to the throne proved more dangerous to the Empires stability than foreign invasion. Parthian power evaporated when Ardashir I the Persian ruler of Istakhr killed the last Parthian ruler Artabanus IV and founded the Sasanian Empire in 224 AD. Sassanids and their neighbouring archrival the RomanByzantines were the worlds two dominant powers for over four centuries.7475 The Sasanians established an empire within the frontiers achieved by the Achaemenids with their capital at Ctesiphon. Late antiquity is considered one of Irans most influential periods as under the Sasanians76 their influence reached ancient Rome and through that as far as Western Europe7778 Africa79 China and India80 and played a prominent role in the formation of the mediaeval art of both Europe and Asia.7475 The period of Sasanian rule was a high point in Iranian history characterized by a complex and centralized government bureaucracy and revitalized Zoroastrianism as a legitimizing and unifying force of their rule.81 Mediaeval period and Iranian Intermezzo Main articles Early Muslim conquests Mediaeval Iran and Iranian Intermezzo FalakolAflak in Khorramabad built in 240270 AD during the Sasanian Empire. The Sasanian Empire 224651 AD in 620 at its greatest extent under Khosrow II. Following the early Muslim conquests in the region the influence of Sasanian art architecture music literature and philosophy on Islamic culture ensured the spread of Iranian culture knowledge and ideas throughout the Muslim world. The prolonged ByzantineSasanian wars most importantly the climactic war of 602628 as well as the social conflict within the Sasanian Empire opened the way for an Arab invasion in the seventh century.8283 The empire was initially defeated by the Rashidun Caliphate which was succeeded by the Umayyad Caliphate followed by the Abbasid Caliphate. A prolonged and gradual process of stateimposed Islamization followed which targeted Irans then Zoroastrian majority and included religious persecution848586 demolition of libraries87 and fire temples88 a special tax penalty jizya8990 and language shift.9192 In 750 the Abbasids overthrew the Umayyads.93 Arabs Muslims and Persians of all strata made up the rebel army which was united by the converted Persian Muslim Abu Muslim.949596 In their struggle for power society gradually became cosmopolitan. Persians and Turks began to replace Arabs in most fields. A hierarchy of officials emerged a bureaucracy at first Persian and later Turkish which decreased Abbasid prestige and power for good.97 After two centuries of Arab rule various native semiindependent and independent Muslim Iranian dynasties in the Iranian Plateau rose namely the Tahirids Saffarids Sajids Samanids Ziyarids Buyids Sallarids Rawadids Marwanids Shaddadids Kakuyids Annazids and Hasanwayhids appearing on the fringes of the declining Abbasid Caliphate.98 The period known as the Iranian Intermezzo was an interlude between the decline of Abbasid rule and power by Arabs and the Sunni Revival with the 
11 thcentury emergence of the Seljuks. It consisted Iranian support based on Iranian territory and most significantly a revived Iranian national spirit and culture in an Islamic form. It also revived the Persian language with the most significant Persianlanguage literature from this period being Shahnameh by Ferdowsi the countrys national epic.99100101102 Tomb of Ferdowsi a 
10 thcentury AD Persian poet and the author of Shahnameh the national epic of Iran. The Iranian Intermezzo 8211055 saw the revival of Persian language and a revived Iranian national spirit in an Islamic form. The blossoming literature philosophy mathematics medicine astronomy and art became major elements in a new age for Iranian civilization during a period known as the Islamic Golden Age.103104 The Islamic Golden Age reached its peak by the 
10 th and 
11 th centuries during which Iran was the main theatre of scientific activities.105 The tenth century saw a mass migration of Turkic tribes from Central Asia to Iran.106 Turkic tribesmen were first used in the Abbasid army as mamluks slavewarriors.94 As a result the Mamluks gained significant political power. In 999 large portions of Iran briefly occupied by the Ghaznavids and longer subsequently under the Seljuk and Khwarezmian empires.106 The Seljuks subsequently gave rise to the Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia.107108 The result of the adoption and patronage of Iranian culture by Turkish rulers was the development of a distinct TurcoPersian tradition. From 1219 to 1221 under the Khwarazmian Empire Iran suffered a devastating invasion by the Mongol Empire. According to Steven R. Ward Mongol violence and depredations killed up to threefourths of the population of the Iranian Plateau possibly 10 to 15 million people. Some historians have estimated that Irans population did not again reach its preMongol levels until the mid
20 th century.109 Most modern historians either outright dismiss or are highly skeptical of such statistics and deem them to be exaggerations by Muslim chroniclers of that era. Indeed as far as Iran was concerned the bulk of the Mongol onslaught and battles were in the northeast Iran such as in the cities of Nishapur and Tus.110111112 Following the fracture of the Mongol Empire in 1256 Hulagu Khan established the Ilkhanate Empire in Iran. In 1357 the capital Tabriz was occupied by the Golden Horde khan Jani Beg and the centralised power collapsed resulting in the emergence of rivalling dynasties. In 1370 yet another conqueror Timur took control over Iran establishing the Timurid Empire. In 1387 Timur ordered the complete massacre of Isfahan killing 70000 citizens.113 Early modern period Safavids Main articles Safavid Iran PortugueseSafavid wars and OttomanPersian Wars Ismail I the founder of Safavid Empire By the 15
00 s Ismail I established the Safavid Empire114115 and chose Tabriz as his capital.106 Beginning with Azerbaijan he extended his authority over the Iranian territories and established an intermittent Iranian hegemony over large parts of Greater Iran.116 The Safavids along with the Ottomans and Mughals were the creators of a period in history known as the Gunpowder empires three early modern Muslim empires which flourished from mid
16 th to the early 
18 th century. Iran was predominantly Sunni117 but Ismail instigated a forced conversion to the Shia branch marking one of the most important turning points in the history of Islam and the beginning of modern Iranian history.118119115120121 As a result Iran is the only official Shia nation today with it holding an absolute majority in Iran and the Republic of Azerbaijan.122123 Alogside their home nation Safavids controlled all of what is now Republic of Azerbaijan Bahrain Armenia eastern Georgia parts of the North Caucasus including Russia Iraq Kuwait and Afghanistan as well as parts of Turkey Syria Pakistan Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The relationship between the Safavids and the West begins with the presence of the Portuguese in the Persian Gulf from the 
16 th century oscillating between alliances and open war between the 
17 th and 
18 th century. The Safavid era saw the start of mass integration from Caucasian populations and their mass resettlement within the heartlands of Iran. In 1588 Abbas the Great came to the throne during a troubled period. Under his leadership Iran developed the ghilman system where thousands of Circassian Georgian and Armenian slavesoldiers joined the civil administration and the military. As a result the IranianArmenian community is the largest of Irans national minorities today and the largest Christian religious minority.124 With the help of these newly created layers in Iranian society Abbas eclipsed the power of the Qizilbash in the civil administration the royal house and the military. He relocated the capital from Qazvin to Isfahan making the city the pinnacle of Safavid architecture. During his rule Tabriz was returned to Iran after 18 years of Ottoman rule. In Abbas later years following a court intrigue involving several leading Circassians he became suspicious of his own sons and had them killed or blinded. Following a gradual decline in the late 16
00 s and the early 17
00 s which was caused by internal conflicts the continuous wars with the Ottomans and the foreign interference most notably Russian the Safavid rule was ended by the Pashtun rebels who besieged Isfahan and defeated Soltan Hoseyn in 1722. The legacy that Safavids left behind was the revival of Iran as an economic stronghold between East and West the establishment of an efficient state and bureaucracy based upon checks and balances their architectural innovations and patronage for fine arts. The Safavids have also left their mark down to the present era by establishing Twelver Shsm as the state religion of Iran as well as spreading Sha Islam across the Middle East Central Asia Caucasus Anatolia the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia. Afsharids Main articles Afsharid Iran and Afsharid dynasty The Afsharid Empire at its greatest extent under Nader Shah Afshar 17411745 In 1729 Nader Shah Afshar successfully drove out and conquered the Pashtun invaders. He took back the annexed Caucasian territories which were divided among the Ottoman and Russian authorities by the ongoing chaos in Iran. During the reign of Nader Iran reached its greatest extent since the Sasanian Empire reestablishing Iranian hegemony over the Caucasus as well as other major parts of west and central Asia and briefly possessing arguably the most powerful empire at the time.125126127125 At its height it controlled modernday Armenia Georgia Azerbaijan Afghanistan Bahrain Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and parts of Iraq Pakistan Turkey United Arab Emirates Oman and the North Caucasus Dagestan. Nader invaded India and sacked Delhi by the late 17
30 s. His army had easily defeated the Mughals at the Battle of Karnal and eventually captured the Mughal capital in the aftermath of the battle. Because of his military genius some historians have described him as the Napoleon of Iran the Sword of Iran and the Second Alexander.128129 Joseph Stalin used to read about Nader and admired him calling him along with Ivan the Terrible a teacher.130 Starting from a young age Napoleon Bonaparte also used to read about and admire Nader. Napoleon considered himself the new Nader and he himself was later called European Nader Shah.131 Naders territorial expansion and military successes declined following the final campaigns in the Northern Caucasus against then revolting Lezgins. Nader became increasingly cruel as a result of his illness and his desire to extort more and more tax money to pay for his military campaigns. Revolts broke out and Nader crushed them ruthlessly building towers from his victims skulls in imitation of his hero Timur.132133 After his assassination in 1747 most of Naders empire was divided between the Zands Durranis Georgians and the Caucasian khanates while the Afsharid rule was limited to a small local state in Khorasan. His death sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil after which Karim Khan Zand came to power in 17
50.1 09 Zands Main articles Zand dynasty Zand tribe and OttomanPersian War 17751776 See also Bani Utbah invasion of Bahrain and Siege of Kerman The Zand Empire at its greatest extent under Karim Khan 17511779 Compared to its preceding dynasties the geopolitical reach of the Zands was limited. Many of the Iranian territories in the Caucasus gained de facto autonomy and were locally ruled through Caucasian khanates. However they remained subjects and vassals to the Zand kingdom. It later quickly expanded to include much of Iran except for the provinces of Balochistan and Khorasan as well as parts of modern Iraq. The lands of presentday Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia were controlled by khanates which were de jure part of the Zand rule but the region was de facto autonomous.134 The island of Bahrain was also held for the Zands by the autonomous AlMazkur sheikhdom of Bushehr.135136 The reign of its most important ruler Karim Khan was marked by prosperity and peace. With his capital in Shiraz arts and architecture flourished in the city with some themes in architecture being revived from the nearby sites of the Achaemenid and Sasanian periods. Following the death of Karim Khan in 1779 Iran went into decline due to civil war amongst members of the Zand dynasty. Its final ruler Lotf Ali Khan was eventually executed by Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar in 1794. Qajars Main articles Qajar Iran and Qajar dynasty Map of Iran during the Qajar Empire in the 
19 th century the international borders of todays Iran. The Qajars took full control of Iran in 1794 deposing Lotf Ali Khan and founding the Qajar Empire. In 1795 following the disobedience of the Georgian subjects and their alliance with the Russians the Qajars captured Tbilisi at the Battle of Krtsanisi and drove the Russians out of the Caucasus reestablishing Iranian suzerainty over the region. In 1796 Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar seized Mashhad with ease and ended the Afsharid rule once and for all. He was formally crowned as king and chose Tehran as his capital where it still stands today. His reign is noted for the return of a centralized and unified Iran. He had a cruel and rapacious behavior while at the same time he was also viewed as a pragmatic calculating and shrewd military and political leader.137138 The RussoIranian wars of 18041813 and 18261828 resulted in large territorial losses for Iran in the Caucasus comprising all of the South Caucasus and Dagestan.126 As a result of the 
19 thcentury RussoIranian wars the Russians took over Irans integral territories in the region comprising modernday Dagestan Georgia Armenia and Republic of Azerbaijan which was confirmed per the treaties of Gulistan and Turkmenchay.127139140141142143144145 The weakening of Iran made it a victim of the colonial struggle between Russia and Britain known as the Great Game.146 Especially after the treaty of Turkmenchay Russia was the dominant force in Iran147 while the Qajars would also play a role in several Great Game battles such as the sieges of Herat in 1837 and 1856.

72.1 53 Constitutional Revolution Main articles Persian Constitutional Revolution and 
1 st Iranian Majlis The first national Iranian Parliament was established in 1906 during the Persian Constitutional Revolution. Between 1872 and 1905 protesters objected to the sale of concessions to foreigners by Qajar monarchs NaseredDin and MozaffaredDin leading to the Constitutional Revolution in 1905. The first Iranian constitution and the first national parliament were founded in 1906 through the ongoing revolution. The Constitution included the official recognition of Irans three religious minorities Christians Jews and Zoroastrians.154 The struggle related to the constitutional movement was followed by the Triumph of Tehran in 1909 when Mohammad Ali was forced to abdicate. The event ended the period in Iranian history known as the minor tyranny. The revolution was the first of its kind in the Islamic world earlier than the revolution of the Young Turks in 1908. It opened the way for the modern era in Iran and debate in a burgeoning press. Many groups fought to shape the course of the revolution. The old order which Naser alDin had struggled for so long to sustain was finally replaced by new institutions. In 1907 the AngloRussian Convention divided Iran into influence zones formalising many of the concessions. On the pretext of restoring order the Russians occupied northern Iran and Tabriz and maintained a military presence in the region for years. But this did not end the civil uprisings and was soon followed by Mirza Kuchik Khans Jungle Movement against both the Qajar monarchy and foreign invaders. Despite Irans neutrality during World War I the Ottoman Russian and British Empires occupied western Iran and fought the Persian campaign before fully withdrawing their forces in 1921. At least 2 million civilians died in the fighting the Ottomanperpetrated antiChristian genocides or the warinduced famine of 19171919. A large number of Iranian Assyrian and Iranian Armenian Christians as well as those Muslims who tried to protect them were victims of mass murders committed by the invading Ottoman troops.155156157158159 Apart from the rule of Agha Mohammad Khan the Qajar rule is characterised as misrule.106 The inability of Qajar government to maintain the countrys sovereignty during and immediately after World War I led to the Britishdirected 1921 Persian coup dtat and Reza Pahlavis establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty. Reza Pahlavi became Prime Minister and was declared monarch in 1925. Pahlavis Main articles Pahlavi Iran and Pahlavi dynasty See also AngloSoviet invasion of Iran and White Revolution The Big Three at the Tehran Conference in November 1943 Winston Churchill Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin. Irans territorial integrity was further weakened during the Persian campaign of World War I and the invasion by the Ottoman Empire. Four years after the 1921 Persian coup dtat the military officer Reza Pahlavi took power in 1925 thus establishing the Pahlavi dynasty. During World War II in July and August 1941 the British demanded that the Iranian government expel all Germans. Reza Pahlavi refused and on 25 August 1941 the British and Soviets launched a surprise invasion Reza Pahlavis government quickly surrendered.160 The invasions strategic purpose was to secure a supply line to the USSR later named the Persian Corridor secure the oil fields and Abadan Refinery of the UKowned AngloIranian Oil Company prevent a German advance on Bakus oil fields and limit German influence in Iran. Following the invasion on 16 September 1941 Reza Pahlavi was sent to exile and replaced by his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.161162163 Iran became a major conduit for British and American aid to the Soviet Union and an avenue through which over 120000 Polish refugees and Polish Armed Forces fled the Axis advance.164 At the 1943 Tehran Conference the Allied Big ThreeJoseph Stalin Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchillissued the Tehran Declaration to guarantee the postwar independence and boundaries of Iran. However at the end of the war Soviet troops established two puppet states in northwestern Iran the Peoples Government of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Mahabad. This led to the Iran crisis of 1946 one of the first confrontations of the Cold War which ended after oil concessions were promised to the USSR and Soviet forces withdrew in May 1946. The two puppet states were soon overthrown and the oil concessions were later revoked.165166 19511978 Mosaddegh Pahlavi and Khomeini Main articles Nationalization of the Iranian oil industry and 1953 Iranian coup dtat Mohammad Mosaddegh who nationalized the oil industry of Iran in 1951. In 1951 Mohammad Mosaddegh was elected Prime Minister of Iran. Mosaddegh became enormously popular after he nationalized the oil industry which had been largely controlled by foreign interests. He worked to weaken the monarchy until he was removed in the 1953 Iranian coup dtatan AngloAmerican covert operation that marked the first time the US had participated in an overthrow of a foreign government during the Cold War.167 After the coup Pahlavi aligned Iran with the Western Bloc and cultivated a close relationship with the United States to consolidate his power as an authoritarian ruler relying heavily on American support amidst the Cold War. The Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini first came to political prominence in 1963 when he led opposition to Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his White Revolution. Khomeini was arrested in 1963 after declaring Mohammad Reza a wretched miserable man who had embarked on the path toward destruction of Islam in Iran.168 Three days of major riots throughout Iran followed with 15000 killed by the police.169 Khomeini was released after eight months of house arrest and continued his agitation condemning Irans close cooperation with Israel and its capitulations or extension of diplomatic immunity to American government personnel in Iran. In November 1964 Khomeini was rearrested and sent into exile Turkey Iraq and France where he remained for 15 years. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi became increasingly autocratic and sultanistic and Iran entered a decadeslong phase of controversially close relations with the United States and other western governments.170 While Mohammad Reza increasingly modernised Iran and claimed to retain it as a fully secular state171 arbitrary arrests and torture by his secret police the SAVAK were used for crushing political opposition.172 Due to the 1973 oil crisis the economy was flooded with foreign currency causing inflation. By 1974 Iran was experiencing a doubledigit inflation rate and despite many large projects to modernise the country corruption was rampant. By 1975 and 1976 a recession increased unemployment especially among millions of youths who had migrated to the cities looking for construction jobs during the boom years of the early 19
70 s. By the late 19
70 s many of these people opposed the Pahlavis regime and began protesting against it.173 Iranian Revolution Main articles Iranian Revolution 1979 oil crisis and Iran hostage crisis Millions of people protesting against the Pahlavis in Tehran leading to the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and overthrow the monarchy. As major ideological and political tensions persisted between Pahlavi and Khomeini demonstrations began in October 1977 eventually developing into a campaign of civil resistance that included elements of secularism and Islamism.174 In August 1978 the deaths of between 377 and 470 people in the Cinema Rex firecame to serve as a catalyst for the revolutionary movement across Iran with nationwide strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the entire country and its economy for the remainder of that year.175176177 After a year of strikes and demonstrations on 16 January 1979 Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fled to the United States and Ruhollah Khomeini returned from exile in February 1979 forming a new government.178 Several thousand of Iranians gathered to greet him as he landed in the capital city Tehran.179 Following the March 1979 referendum in which 98 of Iranian voters approved the countrys shift to an Islamic republic the new government began efforts to draft the Constitution and Ayatollah Khomeini emerged as the Supreme Leader of Iran in December 1979. Following Khomeinis order to purge the new government of any remaining officials still loyal to Pahlavi many former ministers and officials in Pahlavis regime including former prime minister AmirAbbas Hoveyda were executed.180 After the aftermath of the revolution Iran began to back Shia militancy around the world in an attempt to combat Sunni influence and establish Iranian dominance within the Muslim world ultimately aiming to achieve an Iranianled Shia political order. On 4 November 1979 after the United States refused the extradition of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi a group of Iranian students seized the US Embassy and took 53 American personnel and citizens hostage initiating the Iran hostage crisis.181 Attempts by the Jimmy Carter administration to negotiate the release of the hostages and a failed rescue attempt helped with the falling popularity of Carter among US citizens. On Carters final day in office the last hostages were set free under the Algiers Accords. As a result of the Iranian takeover of the American Embassy the US and Iran severed diplomatic relations in April 1980 and the two countries have had no formal diplomatic relationship since that date.182 The crisis is considered a pivotal episode in the history of IranUnited States relations. The Cultural Revolution began in 1980 with threats to close universities which did not conform to Islamization demands from the new government. All universities were closed down in 1980 and reopened in 19

While the Iraqi leadership had hoped to take advantage of Irans postrevolutionary chaos and expected a decisive victory in the face of a severely weakened Iran the Iraqi military only made progress for three months and by December 1980 the forces of Saddam Hussein had stalled. By mid1982 the Iranian forces began to gain momentum with successfully driving the Iraqis back into Iraq and regaining all lost territory by June 1982. After pushing Iraqi forces back to the prewar border lines Iran rejected United Nations Security Council Resolution 514 and launched an invasion of Iraq conquered Iraqi territory and captured cities such as Basra. The subsequent Iranian offensive within Iraqi territory lasted for five years with Iraq taking back the initiative and subsequently launching a series of major counteroffensives. The war continued until 1988 when the Iraqi army defeated the Iranian forces inside Iraq and pushed the remaining Iranian troops back across the border. Subsequently Iran accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations with both sides withdraw to their prewar borders. It was the longest conventional war of the 
20 th century and the second longest war of this century after the Vietnam War. The total Iranian casualties in the war were estimated to be 123220160000 KIA 60711 MIA and 1100016000 civilians killed.188189 Since the downfall of Saddam Hussein Iran has shaped Iraqs politics and the relationship between the two has warmed immensely.190191192 Significant military assistance has been provided by Iran to Iraq resulting in Iran holding a large amount of influence in Iraqi government and soil. Iraq is also heavily dependent on the more stable and developed Iran for its energy needs so a stable Iraq is an interest for Iran foreign policy wise.193194195 Since 19
90 s Following the end of IranIraq War in 1989 Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani concentrated on a pragmatic probusiness policy of rebuilding and strengthening the economy without making any dramatic break with the ideology of the revolution.
