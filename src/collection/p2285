18 April 18 1906 Mansoura Died February 18 198419840218 aged 77 Cairo Resting place Monastery of St. Theodore Malqata Nationality Egyptian Occupation Egyptologist Labib Habachi   April 18 1906  February 18 1984 was a Coptic Egyptian egyptologist. Dr Habachi spent 30 years in the Antiquities Department of the Egyptian Government ending his career as Chief inspector. During this period he spent an enormous amount of time in numerous dig sites in Egypt and the Sudan. He left government work to accept a position at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago as an Archaeological Consultant to its Nubian Expedition. Tell elDabaedit Between 1929 and 1939 Pierre Montet excavated at Tanis finding the royal necropolis of the Twentyfirst and Twentysecond Dynasties  the finds there almost equalled that of Tutankhamuns tomb in the Valley of the Kings. He believed that he found the location of Avaris and this opinion was widely accepted at the time. Yet Habachi was not convinced. In 194142 he worked at Tell elDaba for the Egyptian Antiquities Service and came to the conclusion that this was in fact Avaris. When a detailed study of the topography of the site and its surroundings was made by Manfred Bietak of the Austrian Archaeological Institute in the 19
80 s Habachis hypothesis was confirmed. Bietaks mission revealed that the actual Hyksos capital was indeed Tell alDaba. 1 Works selectionedit KhatanaQantir importance.
