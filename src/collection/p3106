They are usually but not always traditionally divided into 33 pharaonic dynasties these dynasties are commonly grouped by modern scholars into kingdoms and intermediate periods. The first 30 divisions come from the 
3 rd century BC Egyptian priest Manetho whose Aegyptaiaca was probably written for a Greekspeaking Ptolemaic ruler of Egypt but survives only in fragments and summaries. The names of the last two the shortlived Persianruled 
31 st Dynasty and the longerlasting Ptolemaic Dynasty are later coinings. While widely used and useful the system does have its shortcomings. Some dynasties only ruled part of Egypt and existed concurrently with other dynasties based in other cities. The 
7 th might not have existed at all the 
10 th seems to be a continuation of the 
9 th and there might have been one or several Upper Egyptian Dynasties before what is termed the 
1 st Dynasty.
