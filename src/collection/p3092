Gorringe 18822 Lists of obelisks published during the 
19 th century Obelisks had a prominent role in the architecture and religion of ancient Egypt.3 This list contains all known remaining ancient Egyptian obelisks.12 The list does not include modern or premodern pseudoEgyptian obelisks such as the numerous Egyptianstyle obelisks commissioned by Roman Emperors. The list also excludes approximately 40 known obelisk fragments catalogued by Hiroyuki Nagase and Shoji Okamoto.4 Numberedit Aswan Beirut Cairo Dorset Durham Faiyum Florence Istanbul London Luxor New York City Paris Pozna Rome Urbino The location of the extant ancient Egyptian obelisks Only about 30 such obelisks are still in existence worldwide figures vary between sources with different definitions of extant Egyptian obelisks.5 For example David Allen states there are 29 such obelisks with more in Italy than in Egypt.5 Only two known obelisks date prior to the New Kingdom both of which were dedicated to the Middle Kingdom Pharaoh Senusret I. At least 22 of the known obelisks date to the New Kingdom four date to the Late Period and one to the Ptolemaic period. The international transportation of Egyptian obelisks dates to the Roman conquest of Egypt following the death of Cleopatra and in modern times as Egyptian gifts to other major cities such as the Luxor Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde in Paris and the Cleopatras Needles on the Victoria Embankment and in Central Park in London and New York City respectively.5 Only five obelisks still stand at the ruins of Ancient Egyptian temples.4 The largest known obelisk the unfinished obelisk was never erected and was discovered in its original quarry. It is nearly onethird larger than the largest ancient Egyptian obelisk ever erected the Lateran Obelisk in Rome if finished it would have measured around 
41.7 5 metres 1
37.0  ft6 and would have weighed nearly 1090 tonnes 1200 short tons a weight equal to about 200 African elephants.7 The most recent ancient obelisk to be reerected is the 
17 metretall Ramses II obelisk in Tahrir Square the main city square of Cairo having been reassembled from eight blocks discovered at Tanis in the late 
19 th century.8 Dr Khaled ElAnany Egyptian Minister of Tourism and Antiquities said When we go to European capitals like Rome or Paris or London and also Washington sic we see that they use Egyptian obelisks in decorating their major tourist squares so why do we not do the same9 Listedit Name Image Height with base Pharaoh Original location Current location Ref Name Reign Place since City Sovereign state Unfinished obelisk
