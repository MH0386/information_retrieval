21 st Dynasty of ancient Egypt. He is mainly known for being the father of the founder of the 
22 nd Dynasty pharaoh Shoshenq I. Biographyedit Nimlot A was a son of the Great Chief of the Ma Shoshenq A and of the Kings mother Mehtenweskhet A and thus a fullbrother of the 
21 st Dynasty pharaoh Osorkon the Elder. His wife was Tentsepeh A by whom he had a son Shoshenq B who later became pharaoh Shoshenq I for this reason Nimlot and Tentsepeh were posthumously called Gods father and Gods mother. It is probable that the couple also had a daughter Mehtenweskhet B who married the High Priest of Ptah Shedsunefertum.1 When Nimlot A died his son Shoshenq inherited the title of Great Chief of the Ma Shoshenq obtained by pharaoh Psusennes II the permission to build at Abydos a great dedicatory inscription in honor of his father. Nimlot A and Tentsepeh A are also mentioned in the genealogy reported on the stela of Pasenhor.1              Shoshenq A  Mehtenweskhet A          unknown chief                                                                                                                                    Osorkon the Elder      Nimlot A  Tentsepeh A                                                                                                                                               Shoshenq I    Mehtenweskhet B  Shedsunefertum Referencesedit  a b Kenneth Kitchen The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt 1100650 BC 1996 Aris  Phillips Limited Warminster ISBN 0856682985  85 88 90 239 437.
