1 st Intermediate Period 21812055 BC Shemay also Shemai was an ancient Egyptian official and later vizier toward the end of the 
8 th Dynasty 
22 nd century BCE during the First Intermediate Period mainly known for being the beneficiary of most of the Coptos Decrees.1 His career has been interpreted as a glaring sign of the extreme weakness of the central power forced to bestow great privileges to maintain the loyalty of powerful local governors.23 Shemay is buried in a mudbrick mastaba just south of Coptos.4 Attestationsedit Shemay is known primarily from the Coptos Decrees a series of decrees by various king of the 
8 th Dynasty granting titles and honours to him and his family. Shemay is also known from several rock inscriptions in the Wadi Hammamat5 and from his tomb located just south of Coptos.67 Lifeedit Careeredit The earliest mention of Shemay came from the three Coptos Decrees g to i which are generally attributed to pharaoh Neferkaure and one of these is datable to his Year 4. These documents were displayed in the temple of Min at Coptos and were addressed to the Governor of Upper Egypt Shemay  who had been nomarch of the Two Falcons nome with Coptos as capital  and concerning administrative matters about the cult of pharaoh Pepi II and the temple of Min. The earliest of the three decrees mention the new nomarch of Coptos named Idy who very likely was the same person of Idy son of Shemay furthermore the latest of the three decrees ensured to Shemay the responsibility over the 22 nomes of Upper Egypt.3 Shortly after king Neferkaure was succeeded by Neferkauhor and Shemay managed to marry his eldest daughter princess Nebyet in a single day of his Year 1 possibly in the same day of his accession to the throne the Month 2 of Peret Day 2018 Neferkauhor promulgated 8 of the Coptos Decrees j to q the beneficiary of which was always the newly promoted vizier Shemay as well as various member of his family.2 The first decree concerned Nebyets particular status  as well as Shemays one for being the soninlaw of the new pharaoh. Subsequent decrees established other new benefits for Shemays sons Idy again filled the vacuum left by his father occupying the office of Governor of Upper Egypt although he was responsible only of the 7 southernmost nomes of Upper Egypt9 while another son earned a title in the temple of Min.1 Shemay and Nebyet also gained some privilege that were unprecedented for nonroyal people in fact some priests were assigned to the funerary cult of their ka and the couple was allowed to make their own mortuary monuments from royalexclusively red granite.3 It seems that Shemay was already defunct when the last of the Coptos Decrees r was issued by the Horus Djemedjibtawy who has been tentatively identified with both Wadjkare and Neferirkare in fact it was addressed to the vizier Idy1 providing evidence that once again the son followed his fathers footsteps.3 Titlesedit In life he gathered an impressive number of titles and offices in a decree he is called ...the gods father beloved of god kings foster child pyramidtown overseer and vizier overseer of scribes of the kings document governor of Upper Egypt sole companion chamberlain herdsman of Hierakonpolis chief of El Kab lector priest overseer of the priest of Min.10 Further high titles are found in his tomb irypat hereditary prince and Hatya count.4 Tombedit Excavationsedit Shemay is buried in a tomb 1 km 
0.6 2 mi south of Coptos on a hill within the flood plain in modern Kom elKoffar also known as Kom elMomanien and Naga elKom. The tomb was first excavated in 1956 by Labib Habachi and then from 1979 until 1982 by Rabia Hamdan.1112 More recent excavation works have taken place in 2000 and 20
02.4  Layoutedit The tomb consists of a large mudbrick mastaba with a pillared hall in its center which is entered from the North side via a forecourt and an 8 m 26 ft long causeway.4 All these structures are paved with limestone while the walls of the pillared hall were adorned with offering scenes.4 A red granite false door is located on the southeast wall of the hall. Several stelae representing Shemay were discovered in niches on the external northern face of the mastaba were offerings to Shemay would possibly have been made.4 An inscription on the East wall of the hall is dated to the first year of the reign of Neferkauhor fourth month of the Shemu season day 
2.1 3 This inscription is the sole contemporary attestation of Neferkauhor beyond the Coptos Decrees. The upper register of the wall shows on the left Shemay with his wife. In front of him are workmen dragging a stone. In the middle register is shown the slaughtering of a bull and the dragging of another stone. In this register king Neferkauhor is mentioned twice. The lowest register shows a boat fight in the marshes.14 Another inscription details what Shemays son Idy did for his father giving offerings and ordering repair works in the necropolis.15 Referencesedit  a b c d William C. Hayes Royal decrees from the temple of Min at Coptus JEA 32 1946 p. 20.  a b Alan Gardiner Egypt of the Pharaohs an introduction Archived 20240501 at the Wayback Machine Oxford University Press 1964 p. 108 quote But perhaps the most persuasive evidence of their shortlived domination is offered by some inscriptions discovered by Raymond Weill at Coptos in 191011. Under the ruins of a structure of Roman date were found carefully towed away a number of decrees carved in hieroglyphic on slabs of limestone some dating from the reign of Pepy II and most of them designed to protect the temple of Min and its priesthood from interference and the corvee. But among them as many as eight were apparently dispatched on the same day in the first year of a King Neferkare the last king but one in the series of the Abydos list. The addressee was in each case the vizier Shemai and each royal command was concerned either with him or some member of his family. One of the decrees confirmed him in his vizierate in all the twentytwo nomes of Upper Egypt while another recorded the appointment of his son Idi to the post of Governor of Upper Egypt in the seven southernmost nomes. A third decree grants precedence over all other women to Shemais wife Nebye who is described as a Kings eldest daughter and perhaps even more remarkable is a fourth making elaborate arrangements for the funerary cult of both husband and wife in all the temples of the land. There is no hint of unrest or political disturbance in any of these texts though we may possibly read into them a desperate anxiety on the kings part to conciliate one specially powerful Upper Egyptian magnate.  a b c d Toby Wilkinson The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt The History of a Civilisation from 30
