3 rdcentury queen of the Palmyrene Empire in Syria For other uses see Zenobia disambiguation. Zenobia  Augusta Zenobia as empress on the obverse of an antoninianus AD 272 Empress of Palmyra Reign AD 272 Comonarch Vaballathus Queen of Egypt Reign 270272 Queen mother regent of Palmyra Regency 267272 Monarch Vaballathus Queen consort of Palmyra Tenure 260267 Born Septimia Btzby BatZabbai c.240 Palmyra Syria Died After 274 Spouse Odaenathus Issue Vaballathus Hairan II Septimius Antiochus Names Septimia Zenobia BatZabbai Regnal name Septimia Zenobia Augusta House House of Odaenathus Septimia Zenobia Palmyrene Aramaic  BatZabbai c. 240  c. 274 was a thirdcentury queen of the Palmyrene Empire in Syria. Many legends surround her ancestry she was probably not a commoner and she married the ruler of the city Odaenathus. Her husband became king in 260 elevating Palmyra to supreme power in the Near East by defeating the Sasanian Empire of Persia and stabilizing the Roman East. After Odaenathus assassination Zenobia became the regent of her son Vaballathus and held de facto power throughout his reign. In 270 Zenobia launched an invasion that brought most of the Roman East under her sway and culminated with the annexation of Egypt. By mid271 her realm extended from Ancyra central Anatolia to Upper Egypt although she remained nominally subordinate to Rome. However in reaction to the campaign of the Roman emperor Aurelian in 272 Zenobia declared her son emperor and assumed the title of empress thus declaring Palmyras secession from Rome. The Romans were victorious after heavy fighting the empress was besieged in her capital and captured by Aurelian who exiled her to Rome where she spent the remainder of her life. Zenobia was a cultured monarch and fostered an intellectual environment in her court which was open to scholars and philosophers. She was tolerant toward her subjects and protected religious minorities. The empress maintained a stable administration which governed a multicultural multiethnic empire. Zenobia died after 274 and many tales have been recorded about her fate. Her rise and fall have inspired historians artists and novelists and she is a patriotic symbol in Syria. Name appearance and sourcesedit Zenobia was born c. 2402411 and bore the gentilicium surname Septimia.note 14 Her native Palmyrene name was BatZabbai written Btzby in the Palmyrene alphabet5 an Aramaic name meaning daughter of Zabbai.6 Such compound names for women were common in Palmyra where the element bt means daughter but the personal name that follows does not necessarily denote the immediate father rather referring to the ancestor of the family.7 In GreekPalmyras diplomatic and second language used in many Palmyrene inscriptionsshe used the name Zenobia.8 In Palmyra when written in Greek names such as Zabeida Zabdila Zabbai or Zabda were often transformed into Zenobios masculine and Zenobia feminine.9 The element Zabbai from Zenobias native name means gift of N.N. godnote 212 and the name Zenobia translates to one whose life derives from Zeus.8 The historian Victor Duruy believed that the queen used the Greek name as a translation of her native name in deference to her Greek subjects.13 The philologist Wilhelm Dittenberger argued that the name BatZabbai underwent a detortum twist thus resulting in the name Zenobia.14 The ninthcentury historian alTabari in his highly fictionalized account15 wrote that the queens name was Naila alZabba.16 Manichaean sources reporting the visit of the apostle Addai to the region during the time of Odaenathus called Zenobia Queen Tadi wife of kysr caesar.note 3 The name given to Zenobia in those Manichaean writings seems to derive from Tadmor Palmyras native name and this is supported by the Coptic Acts Codex where Zenobia is named Queen Thadmor.18 No contemporary statues of Zenobia have been found in Palmyra or elsewhere only inscriptions on statues bases survive indicating that a statue of the queen once stood in the place most known representations of Zenobia are the idealized portraits of her found on her coins.19 Sculptures of Palmyrene style were normally impersonal unlike Greek and Roman ones a statue of Zenobia in this style would have given an idea of her general style in dress and jewelry but would not have revealed her true appearance.19 The noncontemporary historian Edward Gibbon has described her as being of a dark complexion and considered most lovely and that she equalled in beauty her claimed ancestor Cleopatra.20 British scholar William Wright visited Palmyra toward the end of the nineteenth century in a vain search for a sculpture of the queen.21 In addition to archaeological evidence Zenobias life was recorded in different ancient sources but many are flawed or fabricated the Historia Augusta a lateRoman collection of biographies is the most notable albeit unreliable source for the era.22 The author or authors of the Historia Augusta invented many events and letters attributed to Zenobia in the absence of contemporary sources.22 Some Historia Augusta accounts are corroborated from other sources and are more credible.22 The Byzantine chronicler Joannes Zonaras is considered an important source for the life of Zenobia.22 Origin family and early lifeedit Palmyrene society was an amalgam of Semiticspeaking peoples mostly Arabs and Arameans and Zenobia cannot be identified with any one group as a Palmyrene she may have had both Arab and Aramean ancestry.23 Information about Zenobias ancestry and immediate family connections is scarce and contradictory.24 Nothing is known about her mother and her fathers identity is debated.25 Manichaean sources mention a Nafsha sister of the queen of Palmyra25 but those sources are confused and Nafsha may refer to Zenobia herself26 it is doubtful that Zenobia had a sister.27 Apparently not a commoner28 Zenobia would have received an education appropriate for a noble Palmyrene girl.29 The Historia Augusta contains details of her early life although their veracity is dubious according to the Historia Augusta the queens hobby as a child was hunting28 and in addition to her Palmyrene Aramaic mother tongue she was fluent in Egyptian and Greek and spoke Latin.3031 When she was about fourteen years old ca. 255 Zenobia became the second wife of Odaenathus the ras lord of Palmyra.2825 Noble families in Palmyra often intermarried and it is probable that Zenobia and Odaenathus shared some ancestors.14 Contemporary epigraphical evidenceedit Basing their suppositions upon archaeological evidence various historians have suggested several men as Zenobias father Inscription at Palmyra honoring Julius Aurelius Zenobius believed by some to be Zenobias father Julius Aurelius Zenobius appears on a Palmyrene inscription as a strategos of Palmyra in 231232 based on the similarity of the names25 Zenobius was suggested as Zenobias father by the numismatist Alfred von Sallet and others.32 The archaeologist William Waddington argued in favor of Zenobius identification as the father assuming that his statue stood opposite to where the statue of the queen stood in Great Colonnade. However the linguist JeanBaptiste Chabot pointed out that Zenobius statue stood opposite to that of Odaenathus not Zenobia and rejected Waddingtons hypothesis.14 The only gentilicium a hereditary name borne by people that was originally the name of ones gens family or clan by patrilineal descent appearing on Zenobias inscriptions was Septimia not Julia Aurelia which she would have borne if her fathers gentilicium was Aurelius4 and it cannot be proven that the queen changed her gentilicium to Septimia after her marriage.note 42532 One of Zenobias inscriptions recorded her as Septimia BatZabbai daughter of Antiochus.3435 Antiochus identity is not definitively known24 his ancestry is not recorded in Palmyrene inscriptions and the name was not common in Palmyra.36 This combined with the meaning of Zenobias Palmyrene name daughter of Zabbai led scholars such as Harald Ingholt to speculate that Antiochus might have been a distant ancestor the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes or Antiochus VII Sidetes whose wife was the Ptolemaic Cleopatra Thea.3436 In the historian Richard Stonemans view Zenobia would not have created an obscure ancestry to connect herself with the ancient Macedonian rulers if a fabricated ancestry were needed a more direct connection would have been invented.28 According to Stoneman Zenobia had reason to believe her Seleucid ancestry to be true.28 The historian Patricia Southern noting that Antiochus was mentioned without a royal title or a hint of great lineage believes that he was a direct ancestor or a relative rather than a Seleucid king who lived three centuries before Zenobia.36 On the basis of Zenobias Palmyrene name Bat Zabbai her father may have been called Zabbai alternatively Zabbai may have been the name of a more distant ancestor.24 The historian Trevor Bryce suggests that she was related to Septimius Zabbai Palmyras garrison leader and he may even have been her father.24 The archaeologist Charles Simon ClermontGanneau attempting to reconcile the meaning of the name Bat Zabbai with the inscription mentioning the queen as daughter of Antiochus suggested that two brothers Zabbai and Antiochus existed with a childless Zabbai dying and leaving his widow to marry his brother Antiochus. Thus since Zenobia was born out of a levirate marriage she was theoretically the daughter of Zabbai hence the name.37 Ancient sourcesedit In the Historia Augusta Zenobia is said to have been a descendant of Cleopatra and claimed descent from the Ptolemies.note 59 According to the Souda a 
10 thcentury Byzantine encyclopedia38 after the Palmyrene conquest of Egypt39 the sophist Callinicus of Petra wrote a tenvolume history of Alexandria dedicated to Cleopatra.40 According to modern scholars by Cleopatra Callinicus meant Zenobia.note 64042 Apart from legends there is no direct evidence in Egyptian coinage or papyri of a contemporary conflation of Zenobia with Cleopatra.43 The connection may have been invented by Zenobias enemies to discredit hernote 745 but circumstantial evidence indicates that Zenobia herself made the claim an imperial declaration once ascribed to Emperor Severus Alexander died 235 was probably made by Zenobia in the name of her son Vaballathus where the king named Alexandria my ancestral city which indicates a claim to Ptolemaic ancestry.4647 Zenobias alleged claim of a connection to Cleopatra seems to have been politically motivated23 since it would have given her a connection with Egypt and made her a legitimate successor to the Ptolemies throne.48 A relationship between Zenobia and the Ptolemies is unlikely49 and attempts by classical sources to trace the queens ancestry to the Ptolemies through the Seleucids are apocryphal.50 Arab traditions and alZabbaedit Although some Arab historians linked Zenobia to the Queen of Sheba their accounts are apocryphal.50 Medieval Arabic traditions identify a queen of Palmyra named alZabba51 and her most romantic account comes from alTabari.52 According to alTabari she was an Amalekite her father was Amr ibn Zarib an Amlq sheikh who was killed by the Tanukhids.50 AlTabari identifies a sister of alZabba as Zabibah.50 Jadhimah ibn Malik the Tanukhid king who killed the queens father was killed by alZabba.52 According to alTabari alZabba had a fortress along the Euphrates and ruled Palmyra.15 AlTabaris account does not mention the Romans Odaenathus Vaballathus or the Sassanians15 focusing on the tribes and their relations it is immersed in legends.53 Although the account is certainly based on the story of Zenobia15 it is probably conflated with the story of a semilegendary nomadic Arab queen or queens.5453 AlZabbas fortress was probably Halabiye which was restored by the historic Palmyrene queen and named Zenobia.15 Queen of Palmyraedit Consortedit Odaenathus a bust dated to the 2
50 s During the early centuries AD Palmyra was a city subordinate to Rome and part of the province of Syria Phoenice.55 In 260 the Roman emperor Valerian marched against the Sassanid Persian monarch Shapur I who had invaded the empires eastern regions Valerian was defeated and captured near Edessa.56 Odaenathus formally loyal to Rome and its emperor Gallienus Valerians son57 was declared king of Palmyra.58 Launching successful campaigns against Persia he was crowned King of Kings of the East in 2
63.5 9 Odaenathus crowned his eldest son Herodianus as coruler.60 In addition to the royal titles Odaenathus received many Roman titles most importantly corrector totius orientis governor of the entire East and ruled the Roman territories from the Black Sea to Palestine.61 In 267 when Zenobia was in her late twenties or early thirties Odaenathus and his eldest son were assassinated while returning from a campaign.60 The first inscription mentioning Zenobia as queen is dated two or three years after Odaenathus death so exactly when Zenobia assumed the title queen of Palmyra is uncertain.62 However she was probably designated as queen when her husband became king.62 As queen consort Zenobia remained in the background and was not mentioned in the historical record.63 According to later accounts including one by Giovanni Boccaccio she accompanied her husband on his campaigns.64 If the accounts of her accompanying her husband are true according to Southern Zenobia would have boosted the morale of the soldiers and gained political influence which she needed in her later career.63 Possible role in Odaenathus assassinationedit According to the Historia Augusta Odaenathus was assassinated by a cousin named Maeonius.65 In the Historia Augusta Odaenathus son from his first wife was named Herodes and was crowned coruler by his father.66 The Historia Augusta claims that Zenobia conspired with Maeonius for a time because she did not accept her stepson as his fathers heir ahead of her own children.65 The Historia Augusta does not suggest that Zenobia was involved in the events leading to her husbands murder67 and the crime is attributed to Maeonius moral degeneration and jealousy.65 This account according to the historian Alaric Watson can be dismissed as fictional.68 Although some modern scholarship suggests that Zenobia was involved in the assassination due to political ambition and opposition to her husbands proRoman policy she continued Odaenathus policies during her first years on the throne.69 Regentedit Vaballathus Zenobias son and successor of his father Odaenathus on the obverse of an antoninianus AD 272 In the Historia Augusta  Maeonius was emperor briefly before he was killed by his soldiers67 however no inscriptions or evidence exist for his reign.70 At the time of Odaenathus assassination Zenobia might have been with her husband according to chronicler George Syncellus he was killed near Heraclea Pontica in Bithynia.71 The transfer of power seems to have been smooth since Syncellus reports that the time from the assassination to the army handing the crown to Zenobia was one day.71 Zenobia may have been in Palmyra but this would have reduced the likelihood of a smooth transition the soldiers might have chosen one of their officers so the first scenario of her being with her husband is more likely.71 The historical records are unanimous that Zenobia did not fight for supremacy and there is no evidence of delay in the transfer of the throne to Odaenathus and Zenobias son the tenyearold Vaballathus.72 Although she never claimed to rule in her own right and acted as a regent for her son73 Zenobia held the reins of power in the kingdom74 and Vaballathus was kept in his mothers shadow never exercising real power.75 Consolidation of poweredit The Palmyrene monarchy was new allegiance was based on loyalty to Odaenathus making the transfer of power to a successor more difficult than it would have been in an established monarchy.76 Odaenathus tried to ensure the dynastys future by crowning his eldest son coking but both were assassinated.77 Zenobia left to secure the Palmyrene succession and retain the loyalty of its subjects emphasized the continuity between her late husband and his successor her son.77 Vaballathus with Zenobia orchestrating the process assumed his fathers royal titles immediately and his earliest known inscription records him as King of Kings.7772 Roman regions under Odaenathus yellow and the Palmyrene kingdom green Odaenathus controlled a large area of the Roman Eastnote 8 and held the highest political and military authority in the region superseding that of the Roman provincial governors.7960 His selfcreated status was formalized by Emperor Gallienus80 who had little choice but to acquiesce.81 Odaenathuss power relative to that of the emperor and the central authority was unprecedented and elastic but relations remained smooth until his death.82 His assassination meant that the Palmyrene rulers authority and position had to be clarified which led to a conflict over their interpretation.82 The Roman court viewed Odaenathus as an appointed Roman official who derived his power from the emperor but the Palmyrene court saw his position as hereditary.82 This conflict was the first step on the road to war between Rome and Palmyra.82 Odaenathus Roman titles such as dux Romanorum corrector totius orientis and imperator totius orientis differed from his royal eastern ones because the Roman ranks were not hereditary.83 Vaballathus had a legitimate claim to his royal titles but had no right to the Roman onesespecially corrector denoting a senior military and provincial commander in the Roman system which Zenobia used for her son in his earliest known inscriptions with King of Kings.77 Although the Roman emperors accepted the royal succession the assumption of Roman military rank antagonized the empire.84 Emperor Gallienus may have decided to intervene in an attempt to regain central authority35 according to the Historia Augusta praetorian prefect Aurelius Heraclianus was dispatched to assert imperial authority over the east and was repelled by the Palmyrene army.85 The account is doubtful however since Heraclianus participated in Gallienus assassination in 2
68.8 6 Odaenathus was assassinated shortly before the emperor and Heraclianus would have been unable to be sent to the East fight the Palmyrenes and return to the West in time to become involved in the conspiracy against the emperor.note 986 Early reignedit The citadel of Halabiye renamed Zenobia after its renovation by the queen The extent of Zenobias territorial control during her early reign is debated according to the historian Fergus Millar her authority was confined to Palmyra and Emesa until 270.note 1088 If this was the case the events of 270 which saw Zenobias conquest of the Levant and Egypt are extraordinary.87 It is more likely that the queen ruled the territories controlled by her late husband87 a view supported by Southern and the historian Udo Hartmann89 and backed by ancient sources such as the Roman historian Eutropius who wrote that the queen inherited her husbands power.87 The Historia Augusta also mentioned that Zenobia took control of the East during Gallienus reign.8789 Further evidence of extended territorial control was a statement by the Byzantine historian Zosimus who wrote that the queen had a residence in Antioch.note 1187 There is no recorded unrest against the queen accompanying her ascendance in ancient sources hostile to her indicating no serious opposition to the new regime.note 1291 The most obvious candidates for opposition were the Roman provincial governors but the sources do not say that Zenobia marched on any of them or that they tried to remove her from the throne.92 According to Hartmann the governors and military leaders of the eastern provinces apparently acknowledged and supported Vaballathus as the successor of Odaenathus.92 During Zenobias early regency she focused on safeguarding the borders with Persia and pacifying the Tanukhids in Hauran.93 To protect the Persian borders the queen fortified many settlements on the Euphrates including the citadels of Halabiyelater called Zenobiaand Zalabiye.94 Circumstantial evidence exists for confrontations with the Sassanid Persians probably in 269 Vaballathus assumed the victory title of Persicus Maximus the great victor in Persia this may be connected to an unrecorded battle against a Persian army trying to control northern Mesopotamia.note 139596 Expansionedit In 269 while Claudius Gothicus Gallienus successor was defending the borders of Italy and the Balkans against Germanic invasions Zenobia was cementing her authority Roman officials in the East were caught between loyalty to the emperor and Zenobias increasing demands for allegiance.97 The timing and rationale of the queens decision to use military force to strengthen her authority in the East is unclear97 scholar Gary K. Young suggested that Roman officials refused to recognize Palmyrene authority and Zenobias expeditions were intended to maintain Palmyrene dominance.98 Another factor may have been the weakness of Roman central authority and its corresponding inability to protect the provinces which probably convinced Zenobia that the only way to maintain stability in the East was to control the region directly.98 The historian Jacques Schwartz tied Zenobias actions to her desire to protect Palmyras economic interests which were threatened by Romes failure to protect the provinces.99 Also according to Schwartz the economic interests conflicted Bostra and Egypt received trade which would have otherwise passed through Palmyra.100 The Tanukhids near Bostra and the merchants of Alexandria probably attempted to rid themselves of Palmyrene domination triggering a military response from Zenobia.100 Syria and the invasion of Arabia Petraeaedit Bostra sacked by Palmyra in 270 In the spring of 270 while Claudius was fighting the Goths in the mountains of Thrace Zenobia sent her general Septimius Zabdas to Bosra capital of the province of Arabia Petraea97 the queens timing seems intentional.101 In Arabia the Roman governor dux Trassus commanding the Legio III Cyrenaicanote 14 confronted the Palmyrenes and was routed and killed.97 Zabdas sacked the city and destroyed the temple of Zeus Hammon the legions revered shrine.97 A Latin inscription after the fall of Zenobia attests to its destruction103 The temple of Iuppiter Hammon destroyed by the Palmyrene enemies which ... rebuilt with a silver statue and iron doors .104 The city of Umm elJimal may have also been destroyed by the Palmyrenes in connection with their efforts to subjugate the Tanukhids.103 After his victory Zabdas marched south along the Jordan Valley and apparently met little opposition.97 There is evidence that Petra was attacked by a small contingent which penetrated the region.105 Arabia and Judaea were eventually subdued.105 Palmyrene dominance of Arabia is confirmed by many milestones bearing Vaballathus name.102 Syrian subjugation required less effort because Zenobia had substantial support there particularly in Antioch106 Syrias traditional capital.90 The invasion of Arabia coincided with the cessation of coin production in Claudius name by the Antiochean mint indicating that Zenobia had begun tightening her grip on Syria.106 By November 270 the mint began issuing coinage in Vaballathus name.107 The Arabian milestones presented the Palmyrene king as a Roman governor and commander referring to him as vir clarissimus rex consul imperator dux Romanorum.102 The assumption of such titles was probably meant to legitimize Zenobias control of the province not yet a usurpation of the imperial title.108 Until now Zenobia could say that she was acting as a representative of the emperor who was securing the eastern lands of the empire while the Roman monarch was preoccupied with struggles in Europe.109 Although Vaballathus use of the titles amounted to a claim to the imperial throne Zenobia could still justify them and maintain a mask of subordination to Rome83 an imperator was a commander of troops not the equal of an emperor imperator caesar.108 Annexation of Egypt and the campaigns in Asia Minoredit Main article Palmyrene invasion of Egypt The invasion of Egypt is sometimes explained by Zenobias desire to secure an alternative trade route to the Euphrates which was cut because of the war with Persia.110 This theory ignores the fact that the Euphrates route was only partially disrupted and overlooks Zenobias ambition.105 The date of the campaign is uncertain Zosimus placed it after the Battle of Naissus and before Claudius death which sets it in the summer of 2
70.1 11 Watson emphasizing the works of Zonaras and Syncellus and dismissing Zosimus account places the invasion in October 270 after Claudius death.112 According to Watson the occupation of Egypt was an opportunistic move by Zenobia who was encouraged by the news of Claudius death in August.105113 Zenobia was declared Queen of Egypt after Palmyrene invasion of Egypt.114 The appearance of the Palmyrenes on Egypts eastern frontier would have contributed to unrest in the province whose society was fractured Zenobia had supporters and opponents among local Egyptians.105 Palmyra at its zenith in 271 The Roman position was worsened by the absence of Egypts prefect Tenagino Probus who was battling pirates.105111 According to Zosimus the Palmyrenes were helped by an Egyptian general named Timagenes Zabdas moved into Egypt with 70000 soldiers defeating an army of 50000 Romans.113101 After their victory the Palmyrenes withdrew their main force and left a 50
00 soldier garrison.101 By early November105 Tenagino Probus returned and assembled an army he expelled the Palmyrenes and regained Alexandria prompting Zabdas to return.101 The Palmyrene general aimed a thrust at Alexandria where he seems to have had local support the city fell into Zabdas hands and the Roman prefect fled south.105 The last battle was at the Babylon Fortress where Tenagino Probus took refuge the Romans had the upper hand since they chose their camp carefully.106 Timagenes with his knowledge of the land ambushed the Roman rear Tenagino Probus committed suicide and Egypt became part of Palmyra.106 In the Historia Augusta the Blemmyes were among Zenobias allies115 and Gary K. Young cites the Blemmyes attack and occupation of Coptos in 268 as evidence of a PalmyreneBlemmyes alliance.116 Only Zosimus mentioned two invasions contrasting with many scholars who argue in favor of an initial invasion and no retreat followed by a reinforcement which took Alexandria by the end of 2
70.1 01 During the Egyptian campaign Rome was entangled in a succession crisis between Claudius brother Quintillus and the general Aurelian. Egyptian papyri and coinage confirm Palmyrene rule in Egypt the papyri stopped using the regnal years of the emperors from September to November 270 due to the succession crisis. By December regnal dating was resumed with the papyri using the regnal years of the prevailing emperor Aurelian and Zenobias son Vaballathus. Egyptian coinage was issued in the names of Aurelian and the Palmyrene king by November 2
70.1 07 There is no evidence that Zenobia ever visited Egypt.117 Although the operation may have commenced under Septimius Zabbai Zabdas secondincommand the invasion of Asia Minor did not fully begin until Zabdas arrival in the spring of 2
71.1 18 The Palmyrenes annexed Galatia and according to Zosimus reached Ancyra.45 Bithynia and the Cyzicus mint remained beyond Zenobias control and her attempts to subdue Chalcedon failed.118 The Asia Minor campaign is poorly documented but the western part of the region did not become part of the queens authority45119 no coins with Zenobia or Vaballathus portraits were minted in Asia Minor and no royal Palmyrene inscriptions have been found.119 By August 271 Zabdas was back in Palmyra with the Palmyrene empire at its zenith.118 Governanceedit Zenobia ruled an empire of different peoples as a Palmyrene she was accustomed to dealing with multilingual and multicultural diversity since she hailed from a city which embraced many cults.120 The queens realm was culturally divided into easternSemitic and Hellenistic zones Zenobia tried to appease both and seems to have successfully appealed to the regions ethnic cultural and political groups.121 The queen projected an image of a Syrian monarch a Hellenistic queen and a Roman empress which gained broad support for her cause.122 Cultureedit The right colossus of Memnon was probably restored by Zenobia. Zenobia turned her court into a center of learning with many intellectuals and sophists reported in Palmyra during her reign.123 As academics migrated to the city it replaced classical learning centers such as Athens for Syrians.123 The bestknown court philosopher was Longinus124 who arrived during Odaenathus reign and became Zenobias tutor in paideia aristocratic education.125123 Many historians including Zosimus accused Longinus of influencing the queen to oppose Rome.126125 This view presents the queen as malleable125 but according to Southern Zenobias actions cannot be laid entirely at Longinus door.39 Other intellectuals associated with the court included Nicostratus of Trapezus and Callinicus of Petra.127 From the second to the fourth centuries Syrian intellectuals argued that Greek culture did not evolve in Greece but was adapted from the Near East.127 According to Iamblichus the great Greek philosophers reused Near Eastern and Egyptian ideas.128 The Palmyrene court was probably dominated by this school of thought with an intellectual narrative presenting Palmyras dynasty as a Roman imperial one succeeding the Persian Seleucid and Ptolemaic rulers who controlled the region in which Hellenistic culture allegedly originated.128 Nicostratus wrote a history of the Roman Empire from Philip the Arab to Odaenathus presenting the latter as a legitimate imperial successor and contrasting his successes with the disastrous reigns of the emperors.127 Zenobia embarked on several restoration projects in Egypt.129 One of the Colossi of Memnon was reputed in antiquity to sing the sound was probably due to cracks in the statue with solar rays interacting with dew in the cracks.130 The historian Glen Bowersock proposed that the queen restored the colossus silencing it which would explain thirdcentury accounts of the singing and their disappearance in the fourth.131 Religionedit Palmyras most important deities right to left Bel Yarhibol Aglibol and Baalshamin Zenobia followed the Palmyrene paganism132 where a number of Semitic gods with Bel at the head of the pantheon were worshipped.133 Zenobia accommodated Christians and Jews120 and ancient sources made many claims about the queens beliefs42 Manichaean sources alleged that Zenobia was one of their own134 a manuscript dated to 272 mentions that the Queen of Palmyra supported the Manichaeans in establishing a community in Abidar which was under the rule of a king named Amar who could be the Lakhmid king Amr ibn Adi.135 It is more likely however that Zenobia tolerated all cults in an effort to attract support from groups marginalized by Rome.42 Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria wrote that Zenobia did not hand over churches to the Jews to make them into synagogues136 although the queen was not a Christian she understood the power of bishops in Christian communities.137 In Antiochconsidered representative of political control of the East and containing a large Christian communityZenobia apparently maintained authority over the church by bringing influential clerics probably including Paul of Samosata under her auspices.137 She may have bestowed on Paul the rank of ducenarius minor judge he apparently enjoyed the queens protection which helped him keep the diocesan church after he was removed from his office as bishop of Antioch by a synod of bishops in 2
68.1 38 Hughes suggested that Pauls position while Zenobia ruled was in the state treasury.1
39 note 15 Judaismedit Less than a hundred years after Zenobias reign Athanasius of Alexandria called her a Jewess in his History of the Arians.136 In 391 archbishop John Chrysostom wrote that Zenobia was Jewish so did a Syriac chronicler around 664 and bishop Bar Hebraeus in the thirteenth century.136 According to French scholar Javier Teixidor Zenobia was probably a proselyte this explained her strained relationship with the rabbis.143 Teixidor believed that Zenobia became interested in Judaism when Longinus spoke about the philosopher Porphyry and his interest in the Old Testament.143 Although Talmudic sources were hostile to Palmyra because of Odaenathus suppression of the Jews of Nehardea144 Zenobia apparently had the support of some Jewish communities particularly in Alexandria.118 In Cairo145 a plaque originally bearing an inscription confirming a grant of immunity to a Jewish synagogue in the last quarter of the first millennium BC by King Ptolemy Euergetes I or II was found.145 At a much later date the plaque was reinscribed to commemorate the restoration of immunity on the orders of the queen and king.129145 Although it is undated the letters of the inscription date to long after Cleopatra and Anthonys era Zenobia and her son are the only candidates for a king and a queen ruling Egypt after the Ptolemies.129146 The historian E. Mary Smallwood wrote that good relations with the diaspora community did not mean that the Jews of Palestine were content with Zenobias reign and her rule was apparently opposed in that region.144 The Jerusalem Talmud in Tractate Terumot tells the story of the amoraim Rabbi Ammi and Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani who visited Zenobias court and asked for the release of a Jew Zeir bar Hinena detained on her orders.147 The queen refused saying Why have you come to save him He teaches that your creator performs miracles for you. Why not let God save him148 During Aurelians destruction of Palmyra Palestinian conscripts with clubs and cudgels who may have been Jews played a vital role in Zenobias defeat and the destruction of her city.149 There is no evidence of Zenobias birth as a Jew the names of her and her husbands families belonged to the Aramaic onomasticon collection of names.143 The queens alleged patronage of Paul of Samosata who was accused of Judaizing144 may have given rise to the idea that she was a proselyte.42 Only Christian accounts note Zenobias Jewishness no Jewish source mentions it.150 Administrationedit The queen probably spent most of her reign in Antioch117 Syrias administrative capital.90 Before the monarchy Palmyra had the institutions of a Greek city polis and was ruled by a senate which was responsible for most civil affairs.151152 Odaenathus maintained Palmyras institutions as did Zenobia153 a Palmyrene inscription after her fall records the name of Septimius Haddudan a Palmyrene senator.154 However the queen apparently ruled autocratically Septimius Worod Odaenathus viceroy and one of Palmyras most important officials disappeared from the record after Zenobias ascent.155 The queen opened the doors of her government to Eastern nobility.120 Zenobias most important courtiers and advisers were her generals Septemius Zabdas and Septimius Zabbai124 both of whom were generals under Odaenathus and received the gentilicium surname Septimius from him.156 Odaenathus respected the Roman emperors privilege of appointing provincial governors157 and Zenobia continued this policy during her early reign.158 Although the queen did not interfere in daytoday administration she probably had the power to command the governors in the organization of border security.159 During the rebellion Zenobia maintained Roman forms of administration45 but appointed the governors herself most notably in Egypt160 where Julius Marcellinus took office in 270 and was followed by Statilius Ammianus in 271.note 16159 Agreement with Romeedit Palmyrene antoninianus minted in Antioch in AD 271 showing Aurelian left as emperor and Vaballathus as king Zenobia initially avoided provoking Rome by claiming for herself and her son the titles inherited from Odaenathus of subject of Rome and protector of its eastern frontier.93 After expanding her territory she seems to have tried to be recognized as an imperial partner in the eastern half of the empire and presented her son as subordinate to the emperor.162109163 In late 270 Zenobia minted coinage bearing the portraits of Aurelian and Vaballathus Aurelian was titled emperor and Vaballathus king.162 The regnal year in early samples of the coinage was only Aurelians.162 By March 271164 despite indicating Aurelian as the paramount monarch by naming him first in the dating formulae the coinage also began bearing Vaballathus regnal year.165 By indicating in the coinage that Vaballathus reign began in 267 three years before the emperors Vaballathus appeared to be Aurelians senior colleague.165 The emperors blessing of Palmyrene authority has been debated163 Aurelians acceptance of Palmyrene rule in Egypt may be inferred from the Oxyrhynchus papyri which are dated by the regnal years of the emperor and Vaballathus.162166 No proof of a formal agreement exists and the evidence is based solely on the joint coinage and papyridating.163 It is unlikely that Aurelian would have accepted such powersharing162 but he was unable to act in 271 due to crises in the West.163162 His apparent condoning of Zenobias actions may have been a ruse to give her a false sense of security while he prepared for war.163162 Another reason for Aurelians tolerance may have been his desire to ensure a constant supply of Egyptian grain to Rome167 it is not recorded that the supply was cut and the ships sailed to Rome in 270 as usual.160 Some modern scholars such as Harold Mattingly suggest that Claudius Gothicus had concluded a formal agreement with Zenobia which Aurelian ignored.43 Empress and open rebellionedit Coin of Zenobia as empress with Juno on the reverse AD 272 An inscription found in Palmyra and dated to August 271 called Zenobia eusebes the pious164 this title used by Roman empresses could be seen as a step by the queen toward an imperial title.168 Another contemporary inscription called her sebaste the Greek equivalent of empress Latin Augusta but also acknowledged the Roman emperor.168 A late271 Egyptian grain receipt equated Aurelian and Vaballathus jointly calling them Augusti.168 Finally Palmyra officially broke with Rome169 the Alexandrian and Antiochian mints removed Aurelians portrait from the coins in April 272 issuing new tetradrachms in the names of Vaballathus and Zenobia who were called Augustus and Augusta respectively.168 The assumption of imperial titles by Zenobia signaled a usurpation independence from and open rebellion against Aurelian.170 The timeline of events and why Zenobia declared herself empress is vague.171 In the second half of 271172 Aurelian marched to the East but was delayed by the Goths in the Balkans170 this may have alarmed the queen driving her to claim the imperial title.171 Zenobia also probably understood the inevitability of open conflict with Aurelian and decided that feigning subordination would be useless173 her assumption of the imperial title was used to rally soldiers to her cause.173 Aurelians campaign seems to have been the main reason for the Palmyrene imperial declaration and the removal of his portrait from its coins.16899 Downfalledit Route of Aurelians campaign The usurpation which began in late March or early April 272 ended by August.174 Aurelian spent the winter of 271272 in Byzantium175 and probably crossed the Bosporus to Asia Minor in April 2
72.1 76 Galatia fell easily the Palmyrene garrisons were apparently withdrawn and the provincial capital of Ancyra was regained without a struggle.177 All the cities in Asia Minor opened their doors to the Roman emperor with only Tyana putting up some resistance before surrendering this cleared the path for Aurelian to invade Syria the Palmyrene heartland.178 A simultaneous expedition reached Egypt in May 272 by early June Alexandria was captured by the Romans followed by the rest of Egypt by the third week of June.177 Zenobia seems to have withdrawn most of her armies from Egypt to focus on Syriawhich if lost would have meant the end of Palmyra.176 In May 272 Aurelian headed toward Antioch.179 About 40 kilometres 25 mi north of the city he defeated the Palmyrene army led by Zabdas at the Battle of Immae.179180 As a result Zenobia who waited in Antioch during the battle retreated with her army to Emesa.181 To conceal the disaster and make her flight safer she spread reports that Aurelian was captured Zabdas found a man who resembled the Roman emperor and paraded him through Antioch.182 The following day Aurelian entered the city before marching south.181 After defeating a Palmyrene garrison south of Antioch183 Aurelian continued his march to meet Zenobia in the Battle of Emesa.183 The 700
00 strong Palmyrene army assembled on the plain of Emesa nearly routed the Romans.183 In an initial thrill of victory they hastened their advance breaking their lines and enabling the Roman infantry to attack their flank.183 The defeated Zenobia headed to her capital on the advice of her war council leaving her treasury behind.184 In Palmyra the empress prepared for a siege185 Aurelian blockaded foodsupply routes186 and there were probably unsuccessful negotiations.187 According to the Augustan History Zenobia said that she would fight Aurelian with the help of her Persian allies however the story was probably fabricated and used by the emperor to link Zenobia to Romes greatest enemy.187 If such an alliance existed a muchlarger frontier war would have erupted however no Persian army was sent.187 As the situation worsened the queen left the city for Persia intending on seeking help from Palmyras former enemy according to Zosimus she rode a female camel the fastest of its breed and faster than any horse.184188 Captivity and fateedit Hadrians Villa Zenobia reportedly spent her last days in a villa near Hadrians complex in Tibur. Aurelian learning about Zenobias departure sent a contingent which captured the empress before she could cross the Euphrates to Persia188 Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobias captivity reached the city in August 272.note 17190154 Aurelian sent the empress and her son to Emesa for trial followed by most of Palmyras court elite including Longinus.191 According to the Augustan History and Zosimus Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers however there are no contemporary sources describing the trial only later hostile Roman ones.191 The empresss reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelians propaganda it benefited the emperor to paint Zenobia as selfish and traitorous discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero.191 Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed he spared the empress and her son to parade her in his planned triumph.192 Zenobias fate after Emesa is uncertain since ancient historians left conflicting accounts.193 Zosimus wrote that she died before crossing the Bosporus on her way to Rome according to this account the empress became ill or starved herself to death.193 The generally unreliable chronicler John Malalas194 wrote that Aurelian humiliated Zenobia by parading her through the eastern cities on a dromedary in Antioch the emperor had her chained and seated on a dais in the hippodrome for three days before the citys populace.193195 Malalas concluded his account by writing that Zenobia appeared in Aurelians triumph and was then beheaded.196 Most ancient historians and modern scholars agree that Zenobia was displayed in Aurelians 274 triumph196 Zosimus was the only source to say that the empress died before reaching Rome making his account questionable.197 A public humiliation as recounted by Malalas is a plausible scenario since Aurelian would probably have wanted to publicize his suppression of the Palmyrene rebellion.193 Only Malalas however describes Zenobias beheading according to the other historians her life was spared after Aurelians triumph.196 The Augustan History recorded that Aurelian gave Zenobia a villa in Tibur near Hadrians Villa where she lived with her children.198199 Zonaras wrote that Zenobia married a nobleman200 and Syncellus wrote that she married a Roman senator.198 The house she reportedly occupied became a tourist attraction in Rome.201 Titlesedit Lead token naming Zenobia as queen c. 268 The queen owed her elevated position to her sons minority.202 To celebrate Herodianus coronation a statue was erected in Palmyra in 2
63.2 03 According to the inscription on the base of the statue it was commissioned by Septimius Worod then the duumviri magistrate of Palmyra and Julius Aurelius the Queens procurator treasurer.204 According to the historian David Potter Zenobia is the queen mentioned and the inscription is an evidence for the usage of the title by her during Odaenathus lifetime.205 An inscription on a milestone on the road between Palmyra and Emesa dated to Zenobias early reign206 identifies her as illustrious queen mother of the king of kings35 this was the first inscription giving her an official position.207 A lead token from Antioch also identifies Zenobia as queen.note 18211210 The earliest confirmed attestation of Zenobia as queen in Palmyra is an inscription on the base of a statue erected for her by Zabdas and Zabbai dated to August 271 and calling her most illustrious and pious queen.207212 On an undated milestone found near Byblos Zenobia is titled Sebaste.171 The queen was never acknowledged as sole monarch in Palmyra although she was the de facto sovereign of the empire74 she was always associated with her husband or son in inscriptions except in Egypt where some coins were minted in Zenobias name alone.74 According to her coins the queen assumed the title of Augusta empress in 272168 and reigned under the regnal name Septimia Zenobia Augusta.213 Descendantsedit Septimius Herodianus might have been the same person as Hairan II a probable son of Zenobia Aside from Vaballathus it is unclear if Zenobia had other children and their alleged identities are subject to scholarly disagreements. The image of a child named Hairan II appears on a seal impression with that of his brother Vaballathus no name of a mother was engraved and the seal is undated.214 Odaenathus son Herodianus is identified by Udo Hartmann with Hairan I a son of Odaenathus who appears in Palmyrene inscriptions as early as 2
51.2 15 David S. Potter on the other hand suggested that Hairan II is the son of Zenobia and that he is Herodianus instead of Hairan I.216 Nathanael Andrade maintained that Hairan I Herodianus and Hairan II are the same person rejecting the existence of a second Hairan.217 A controversial Palmyrene inscription mentions the mother of the King Septimius Antiochus the name of the queen is missing and Dittenberger refused to fill the gap with Zenobias name but many scholars such as Grace Macurdy considered that the missing name is Zenobia.213 Septimius Antiochus may have been Vaballathus younger brother or was presented in this manner for political reasons Antiochus was proclaimed emperor in 273 when Palmyra revolted against Rome for a second time.218 If Antiochus was a son of Zenobia he was probably a young child not fathered by Odaenathus Zosimus described him as insignificant appropriate for a fiveyearold boy.219 On the other hand Macurdy citing the language Zosimus used when he described him considered it more plausible that Antiochus was not a son of Zenobia but a family relation who used her name to legitimize his claim to the throne.213 The names of Herennianus and Timolaus were mentioned as children of Zenobia only in the Historia Augusta.220 Herennianus may be a conflation of Hairan and Herodianus Timolaus is probably a fabrication68 although the historian Dietmar Kienast suggested that he might have been Vaballathus.221 According to the Historia Augusta Zenobias descendants were Roman nobility during the reign of Emperor Valens reigned 3643
75.2 22 Eutropius and Jerome chronicled the queens descendants in Rome during the fourth and fifth centuries.201199 They may have been the result of a reported marriage to a Roman spouse or offspring who accompanied her from Palmyra both theories however are tentative.223 Zonaras is the only historian to note that Zenobia had daughters223 he wrote that one married Aurelian who married the queens other daughters to distinguished Romans.200 According to Southern the emperors marriage to Zenobias daughter is a fabrication.198 Another descent claim is the relation of saint Zenobius of Florence 337417 with the queen the Girolami banking family claimed descent from the fifth century saint224 and the alleged relation was first noted in 12
86.2 25 The family also extended their roots to Zenobia by claiming that the saint was a descendant of her.226 Evaluation and legacyedit An evaluation of Zenobia is difficult the queen was courageous when her husbands supremacy was threatened and by seizing the throne she protected the region from a power vacuum after Odaenathus death.227 According to Watson she made what Odaenathus left her a glittering show of strength.228 In the view of Watson Zenobia should not be seen as a total powermonger nor as a selfless hero fighting for a cause according to the historian David Graf She took seriously the titles and responsibilities she assumed for her son and that her program was far more ecumenical and imaginative than that of her husband Odenathus not just more ambitious.228 Zenobia has inspired scholars academics musicians and actors her fame has lingered in the West and is supreme in the Middle East.23 As a heroic queen with a tragic end she stands alongside Cleopatra and Boudica.23 The queens legend turned her into an idol that can be reinterpreted to accommodate the needs of writers and historians thus Zenobia has been by turns a freedom fighter a hero of the oppressed and a national symbol.27 The queen is a female role model229 according to the historian Michael Rostovtzeff Catherine the Great liked to compare herself to Zenobia as a woman who created military might and an intellectual court.202 During the 19
30 s thanks to an Egyptianbased feminist press Zenobia became an icon for womensmagazine readers in the Arabicspeaking world as a strong nationalistic female leader.230 Her most lasting legacy is in Syria where the queen is a national symbol.231 Zenobia became an icon for Syrian nationalists she had a cult following among Westerneducated Syrians and an 1871 novel by journalist Salim Al Bustani was entitled Zenobia malikat Tadmor Zenobia Queen of Palmyra.232 Syrian nationalist Ilyas Matar who wrote Syrias first history in Arabic in 1874233234 alUqud aldurriyya fi tarikh almamlaka alSuriyya The Pearl Necklace in the History of the Syrian Kingdom235 was fascinated by Zenobia and included her in his book.236 To Matar the queen kindled hope for a new Zenobia who would restore Syrias former grandeur.236 Another history of Syria was written by Jurji Yanni in 1881237 in which Yanni called Zenobia a daughter of the fatherland and yearned for her glorious past.238 Yanni described Aurelian as a tyrant who deprived Syria of its happiness and independence by capturing its queen.238 In modern Syria Zenobia is regarded as a patriotic symbol her image appeared on banknotes231 and in 1997 she was the subject of the television series AlAbabeed The Anarchy.23 The series was watched by millions in the Arabicspeaking world.23 It examined the IsraeliPalestinian conflict from a Syrian perspective where the queens struggle symbolized the Palestinians struggle to gain the right of selfdetermination.231 Zenobia was also the subject of a biography by Mustafa Tlass Syrias former minister of defense and one of the countrys most prominent figures.231 Myth romanticism and popular cultureedit Harold Mattingly called Zenobia one of the most romantic figures in history.227 According to Southern The real Zenobia is elusive perhaps ultimately unattainable and novelists playwrights and historians alike can absorb the available evidence but still need to indulge in varied degrees of speculation.239 She has been the subject of romantic and ideologicallydriven biographies by ancient and modern writers.240241 The Augustan History is the clearest example of an ideological account of Zenobias life and its author acknowledged that it was written to criticize the emperor Gallienus.241 According to the Augustan History Gallienus was weak because he allowed a woman to rule part of the empire and Zenobia was a more able sovereign than the emperor. The narrative changed as the Augustan History moved on to the life of Claudius Gothicus a lauded and victorious emperor with the author characterizing Zenobias protection of the eastern frontier as a wise delegation of power by Claudius.242 When the Augustan History reached the biography of Aurelian the authors view of Zenobia changed dramatically the queen is depicted as a guilty insolent proud coward242 her wisdom was discredited and her actions deemed the result of manipulation by advisers.53 Zenobias staunch beauty was emphasized by the author of the Augustan History who ascribed to her feminine timidity and inconsistency the reasons for her alleged betrayal of her advisers to save herself. The queens sex posed a dilemma for the Augustan History since it cast a shadow on Aurelians victory.243 Its author ascribed many masculine traits to Zenobia to make Aurelian a conquering hero who suppressed a dangerous Amazon queen.243 According to the Augustan History Zenobia had a clear manly voice dressed as an emperor rather than an empress rode horseback was attended by eunuchs instead of ladiesinwaiting marched with her army drank with her generals was careful with money contrary to the stereotypical spending habits of her sex and pursued masculine hobbies such as hunting.244 Giovanni Boccaccio wrote a fanciful 
14 thcentury account of the queen in which she is a tomboy in childhood who preferred wrestling with boys wandering in the forests and killing goats to playing like a young girl.245 Zenobias chastity was a theme of these romanticized accounts according to the Augustan History she disdained sexual intercourse and allowed Odaenathus into her bed only for conception.245 Her reputed chastity impressed some male historians Edward Gibbon wrote that Zenobia surpassed Cleopatra in chastity and valor.245 According to Boccaccio Zenobia safeguarded her virginity when she wrestled with boys as a child.245 Seventeenthcentury visitors to Palmyra rekindled the Western worlds romantic interest in Zenobia.53 This interest peaked during the midnineteenth century when Lady Hester Stanhope visited Palmyra and wrote that its people treated her like the queen she was reportedly greeted with singing and dancing and Bedouin warriors stood on the citys columns.30 A procession ended with a mock coronation of Stanhope under the arch of Palmyra as queen of the desert.30 William Ware fascinated by Zenobia wrote a fanciful account of her life. Twentiethcentury novelists and playwrights such as Haley Elizabeth Garwood and Nick Dear also wrote about the queen.21 Selected cultural depictionsedit Harriet Hosmers Zenobia Queen of Palmyra 1857 Queen Zenobias Last Look upon Palmyra by Herbert Gustave Schmalz 1888 Sculptures Zenobia Queen of Palmyra 1857 by Harriet Hosmer exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago.246 Zenobia in Chains 1859 by Harriet Hosmer.

71.1 7  Both Dittenberger and von Sallet believed that Zenobia bore the gentilicium Julia Aurelia during her marriage and took the gentilicium Septimia after Odaenathus death von Sallet argued that the coins minted by Vaballathus in Alexandria bore the initials of the names Julius Aurelius and Septimius before his own name.33 Therefore it is apparent that Vaballathus took his maternal familys name beside his paternal one.14  The writer of the Historia Augusta might have based his account on the work of Ammianus Marcellinus who wrote about the habits of men in vaulted baths and how they extol women with such disgraceful flattery as the Parthians do Semiramis the Egyptians their Cleopatras the Carians do Artemisia or the people of Palmyra do Zenobia.9 If the Historia Augusta writer did indeed use the words of Ammianus then the remark about Zenobias supposed descent loses its merit.9  The conclusion that Callinicus meant Zenobia is based on the fact that the work was written following Palmyras invasion of Egypt combined with what is known about Zenobias alleged claims of descent from Cleopatra.39 The first scholar to suggest that by Cleopatra Callinicus meant Zenobia was Aurel Stein in 1923 and his view was accepted by many other historians.41  The Roman view of Cleopatra was negative she was portrayed as a traitorous manipulative woman who used her beauty and sex to achieve her goals.44  The Roman East traditionally included all the Roman lands in Asia east of the Bosphorus.78  A plausible scenario according to the historian David Potter would be that a campaign was sent in 270 by Claudius Gothicus Gallienus successor.85  An oftencited argument for limited territorial control is that the Antiochean Mint did not issue coins in the name of the queen or her son before 2
70.8 7 However in the opinion of Southern this can be explained by the existence of Claudius Gothicus on the imperial throne which made it unnecessary for the queen to issue coins in the name of her son.87 After Claudius death in 270 the imperial throne was contested by his brother Quintillus and the army candidate Aurelian but the Antiochean mint probably under orders from Zenobia who apparently did not recognize Quintillus did not issue coins for both pretenders.87 When Aurelian prevailed Zenobia might have found it an opportunity to declare for him the new coins bore the picture of Aurelian but also for the first time Vaballathus.87  The palace was probably established by Odaenathus who crowned his son in Antioch87 Syrias historical capital.90  According to the Historia Augusta the emperor Aurelian sent a letter to the Senate saying that the Egyptians Armenians and Arabs were so afraid of Zenobia that they did not dare revolt however the author does not say that the Syrians were afraid of the queen.91  Ancient sources accused Zenobia of sympathizing with the Persians claiming that she was worshiped like the Persian leaders and drank wine with their generals95 however the accusations are unfounded since Zenobia fortified the frontier with Persia.94  Although his name is only mentioned by John Malalas archaeological evidence supports the Arabian campaign.102  Paul of Samosata is considered a heretic by mainstream Christianity accused of denying the preexistence of Christ.140 The earliest reference to the relationship between Zenobia and Paul of Samosata comes from Athanasius of Alexandrias fourthcentury History of the Arians.141 According to Eusebius Paul preferred to be called ducenarius instead of bishop142137 There is evidence that he held this rank in the service of Zenobia.138 There is no evidence that Paul was invited to the Palmyrene court and his relationship with Zenobia was exaggerated by later sources.12042 The queen may have supported him as bishop to promote religious tolerance.120  One of Statilius inscriptions is firmly dated to spring 272 so he could have been appointed by the Romans who regained Egypt at that time.161  Many ancient writers including John Malalas Rufius Festus Jordanes George Syncellus and Jerome mistakenly wrote that Zenobia was captured at Immae.189  Dated to 268208 its code in Delbert R. Hillers and Eleonora Cussinis work titled Palmyrene Aramaic Texts PAT209 is PAT 2827 and the inscription read queen Zenobia.210 Referencesedit Citationsedit  Southern 2008 pp. 3 173.
