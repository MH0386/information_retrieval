20 th Dynasty Ramesses VI NebmaatreMeryamun sometimes written Ramses or Rameses also known under his princely name of Amenherkhepshef Cnote 1 was the fifth ruler of the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt. He reigned for about eight years in the midtolate 
12 th century BC and was a son of Ramesses III and queen Iset TaHemdjert. As a prince he was known as Ramesses Amunherkhepeshef and held the titles of royal scribe and cavalry general. He was succeeded by his son Ramesses VII Itamun whom he had fathered with queen Nubkhesbed. After the death of the ruling pharaoh Ramesses V who was the son of Ramesses VIs older brother Ramesses IV Ramesses VI ascended the throne. In the first two years after his coronation Ramesses VI stopped frequent raids by Libyan or Egyptian marauders in Upper Egypt and buried his predecessor in what is now an unknown tomb of the Theban necropolis. Ramesses VI usurped KV9 a tomb in the Valley of the Kings planned by and for Ramesses V and had it enlarged and redecorated for himself. The craftsmens huts near the entrance of KV9 covered up the entrance to Tutankhamuns tomb saving it from a wave of tomb robberies that occurred within 20 years of Ramesses VIs death. Ramesses VI may have planned and made six more tombs in the Valley of the Queens none which are known today. Egypt lost control of its last strongholds in Canaan around the time of Ramesses VIs reign. Though Egyptian occupation in Nubia continued the loss of the Asiatic territories strained Egypts weakening economy and increased prices. With construction projects increasingly hard to fund Ramesses VI usurped the monuments of his forefathers by engraving his cartouches over theirs. Yet he boasted of having covered all the land with great monuments in my name ... built in honour of my fathers the gods. He was fond of cult statues of himself more are known to portray him than any TwentiethDynasty king after Ramesses III. The Egyptologist Amin Amer characterises Ramesses VI as a king who wished to pose as a great pharaoh in an age of unrest and decline. The pharaohs power waned in Upper Egypt during Ramesses VIs rule. Though his daughter Iset was named Gods Wife of Amun the highpriest of Amun Ramessesnakht turned Thebes into Egypts religious capital and a second center of power on par with PiRamesses in Lower Egypt where the pharaoh resided. In spite of these developments there is no evidence that Ramessesnakhts dynasty worked against royal interests which suggests that the Ramesside kings may have approved of these evolutions. Ramesses VI died in his forties in his eighth or ninth year of rule. His mummy lay untouched in his tomb for fewer than 20 years before pillagers damaged it. The body was moved to KV35 during the reign of Pinedjem I and was discovered in 1898 by Victor Loret. His mummy is currently kept in the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization. Familyedit Prince Amunherkhepeshef is shown on the Procession of the Princes relief in Medinet Habu. Parents and early lifeedit Ramesses VI was a son of Ramesses III4 the latter being considered the last great pharaoh of the New Kingdom period.5 This filiation is established beyond doubt by a large relief found in the portico4 of the Medinet Habu temple of Ramesses III known as the Procession of the Princes.67 The relief shows ten princes including Ramesses VI8 worshipping their father.9 Ramesses IIIs sculptors seem to have left the relief incomplete only the figures of the king and princes appear and no names are written in the spaces next to them.note 29 The relief seems to have originally been executed when Ramesses VI was still a young prince as he is shown wearing the sidelock of youth used to denote childhood. When Ramesses VI became king he added his princely names Ramesses Amunherkhepeshefnote 3 inside royal cartouches as well as the titles he held before ascending the throne as kings son of his body his beloved crown prince royal scribe and cavalry general.10 He altered his youthful figure on the Procession of the Princes with an uraeus underscoring his royal status and further completed the relief with the names of all his brothers and sons with the exception of Ramesses IV who had already written his royal name on the relief.711 Speculation in Egyptology during the 19
60 s and 19
70 s concerning the chronology and genealogy of the Twentieth Dynasty as well as uncertainties affecting the identity of the king shown on the Procession of princes relief led some scholars to propose that Ramesses VI was a grandson of Ramesses III and the son either of an unknown prince12 or of the infamous Pentawer involved in the murder of Ramesses III.13 Such hypotheses have now been conclusively rejected and the relief is understood to mean exactly what it shows that Ramesses VI was the son of Ramesses III.note 416 Ramesses VIs mother was probably Iset TaHemdjert Ramesses IIIs Great Royal Wife as suggested by the presence of Ramesses VIs cartouches on a doorjamb of her tomb in the Valley of the Queens.17 Consort and childrenedit Koptos stela of Ramesses VIs daughter Iset to the right Ramesses VIs Great Royal Wife was queen Nubkhesbed.18 The Egyptologists Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton believe that she bore Ramesses VI a total of four children the princes Amenherkhepshef Panebenkemytnote 5 and Ramesses Itamunthe future pharaoh Ramesses VII who succeeded his father for a short while on the throneand princess Iset who was appointed to the priestly role of Divine Adoratrice of Amun.19 A stela recounting this appointment was discovered in Koptos and demonstrates that Nubkhesbed was indeed Isets mother.20 Prince Amenherkhepshef died before his father and was buried in tomb KV13 in the Valley of the Kings originally built for Chancellor Bay an important official of the late Nineteenth Dynasty. The tomb decoration was updated in consequence some reliefs notably mentioning Nubkhesbed.18 Amenherkhepshefs sarcophagus was usurped from queen Twosret.18 The filiation of Ramesses VII is established by an inscription on a doorjamb from Deir elMedinaeh which reads the good god lord of the two lands Usimaaremeryamunsetepenre Son of Re lord of epiphanies Ramesses VII ItAmun god ruler of Heliopolishe has made as his monument for his father may live the good god lord of the two lands Nebmaaremeryamun Son of Re Ramesses VI.21 The Egyptologists James Harris Edward F. Wente and Kenneth Kitchen have also proposed based on circumstantial evidence that Ramesses IX was a son of Ramesses VI and thus a brother to Ramesses VII.22 They note that Ramesses IX honoured Ramesses VII on two offering stands23 suggesting that they were close kin. Ramesses IX named one of his sons Nebmaatre which is Ramesses VIs prenomen possibly as a means to honour his father.note 624 This hypothesis is contested by other scholars including Dodson and Hilton who believe that Ramesses IX was instead a son of prince Montuherkhopshef and thus a nephew to Ramesses VI. They base their conclusion on other circumstantial evidence first is a depiction of Montuherkhopshef in KV19 on which Ramesses IXs prenomen had been added.26 Second is the fact that Ramesses IXs mother was named Takhat and Montuherkhopshefs spouse might have been a lady of the same name hence possibly the same person.27 Reignedit Reign lengthedit Ramesses VI assumed the throne around the interval between Year 1 I Peret day 25 and Year 1 II Peret day 11 of his reign when his predecessor Ramesses V died.28 The scholarly consensus is now that Ramesses VI reigned in the mid 
12 th century BC over a period of eight full years and lived for two months into his brief last regnal year. More precisely the Egyptologist Steve Vinson proposed that he reigned between 1156 BC and 1149 BC29 while the Encyclopdia Britannica reports 11451137 BC30 Jrgen von Beckerath gives 11421134 BC31 Erik Hornung 11451139 BC32 Nicolas Grimal 11441136 BC making him a contemporary of Nebuchadrezzar I of Isin3334 Ian Shaw Jacobus van Dijk and Michael Rice 11431136 BC353637 and 11321125 BC in a 2017 study.38 In 1977 the Egyptologists Edward F. Wente and Charles van Siclen were the first to propose upon reviewing the chronology of the New Kingdom period that Ramesses VI lived into his eighth year of reign.39 This hypothesis was vindicated the next year by the Egyptologist Jac Janssen who published an analysis of an ostraconnote 7 which mentions the loan of an ox in the seventh and eighth years of an unnamed king who can only have been Ramesses VI.note 840 Two years later Lanny Bell reported further evidence that Ramesses VI not only reigned into his eighth regnal year but most likely completed it and lived into his ninth.41 Ramesses VIs eighth year on the throne may also be mentioned in Theban graffito 18
60 a which names the then serving High Priest of Amun Ramessesnakht. This graffito has also been ascribed to Ramesses X42 but this interpretation has been contested and its ascription to Ramesses VI has been proposed as an alternative.41 The subject remains debated.43 An important piece of evidence first recognised by Jansen in 1978 but fully exploited only five years later by the Egyptologist Raphael Ventura is found on the Turin Papyrus 19071908 which covers the time period from Ramesses VIs fifth year until Ramesses VIIs seventh year on the throne.44 The reconstruction of the document proposed by Ventura shows that the simplest solution available to explain the chronology of the period covered by the papyrus is that Ramesses VI enjoyed a reign of eight full years died in his ninth and was succeeded by Ramesses VII rather than Ramesses VIII as had been debated until then.4546 Activities and situation in Egyptedit Early reign strife in the Theban regionedit A statue from Karnak now in the Egyptian Museum shows Ramesses VI holding a bound Libyan captive. Immediately after his accession to the thronenote 9 Ramesses VI and his court may have visited Thebes on the occasion of the Beautiful Festival of the Valley or the Opet Festival concomitant with the preparations for Ramesses Vs burial.50 Ramesses VI visited the city on at least another occasion during his reign when he installed his daughter as Divine Adoratrice of Amun.50 The situation in the south of Egypt at the time of Ramesses VIs accession was not entirely stable as attested by records showing that the workmen of Deir elBahari could not work on the kings tomb owing to the presence of the enemy in the vicinity a situation which occurred over a period of at least fifteen days during Ramesses VIs first year on the throne.1 This enemy was rumoured to have pillaged and burned the locality of PerNebytnote 10 and the chief of the Medjay of Thebesessentially the policeordered the workmen to remain idle and watch the kings tomb.51 It is unclear who these enemies were the term could designate parties of Libyan Meshwesh36 Libu and Egyptian bandits or as the Egyptologist Jaroslav ern conjectured a full blown civil war between followers of Ramesses V and Ramesses VInote 1151 a hypothesis supported by Rice37 but which has been strongly rejected by Kitchen52 and to a lesser extend by Grimal and van Dijk.436 A short military campaign might have ensued and from Ramesses VIs second year on the throne onwards these troubles seem to have stopped. This campaign could be connected with an unusual1 statue of Ramesses VI showing him holding a bound Libyan captive53 as well as with a depiction of Ramesses VI triumphing over foreign soldiers on the second pylon of the Karnak temple.1 This triumph scene was the last one to be made in Egypt until the later reigns of Siamun 986967 BC and Shoshenq I 943922 BC.1 Other indications in favour of strife and military activities early in Ramesses VIs reign are the names he adopted upon ascending the throne his Horus name meaning Strong bull great of victories keeping alive the two lands as well as his Nebty name Powerful of arms attacking the myriads.1 Later reignedit Following these events on his second year of rule Ramesses VI finally buried Ramesses V in a yet unidentified tomb in the Valley of the Kings54 having usurped the tomb originally prepared for his predecessor.1 On the occasion of this visit to Thebes Ramesses VI installed his daughter Iset as Gods Wife of Amun and Divine Adoratice of Amun in the presence of his mother the acting vizier Nehy and other court officials.1 That same year he ordered the reduction of the gang of workmen working on the kings tomb from 120 members to its former number of 60 which had been changed under Ramesses IV.note 125155 Following this the community of workers at Deir elMedina went into gradual decline the settlement being finally abandoned in the subsequent Twentyfirst Dynasty.56 In spite of the reduction the Turin papyrus indicates that Ramesses VI ordered the construction of six tombs in the Valley of the Queens57 a number which might include the hasty58 completion of the tomb of Iset TaHemdjert Ramesses mother.59 It is unknown whether these tombs were finished and in any case they are now unidentifiable.note 136057 This portrait of Ramesses VI was copied during the FrancoTuscan Expedition 61 from a painting in the rulers tomb. At some point in his reign a cult statue of Ramesses VI was installed in a shrine of Ramesses II in the temple of Hathor of Deir elMedina.62 The statue was called Lord of the Two Lands Nebmaatre Meryamun Son of Re Lord of Crowns Ramesses Amunherkhepeshef Divine Ruler of Iunu Beloved like Amun.63 A complete description of it is given on the verso of the Turin Papyrus Map celebrated for being the oldest surviving topographical map. The papyrus indicates that the statue was made of two essences of painted wood and clay showing pharaoh wearing a golden loincloth a crown of lapislazuli and precious stones a uraeus of gold and sandals of electrum.63 The statue is said to receive three services of incense and libations every day.63 The text of the papyrus is a letter directly addressed to Ramesses VI asking that a certain man be put in charge of the offerings.64 The letter seems to have been received favourably by the king as the authors grandson is known to have held the title of High Priest of Nebmaatre Ramesses VI Beloved of Amun.65 Ramesses VI was apparently fond of such cult statues62 and no less than ten statues and a sphinx have been discovered in Tanis Bubastis and Karnak more than any other Ramesside king of the Twentieth Dynasty following the reign of Ramesses III.66 The tomb of Penne an Egyptian highofficial in Nubia reports that Penne made a donation of lands to generate revenue towards the upkeep of yet another cult statue of Ramesses VI.67 Ramesses VI was so satisfied with this deed that he commanded his Viceroy of Kush Give the two silver vessels of ointment of gums to the deputy Penne.6869 While few of Ramesses VIs activities are known in details he is well attested by numerous reliefs inscriptions statues and minor finds from Karnak Koptos and Heliopolis.note 142971 Economic declineedit Over the period spanning the reigns of Ramesses VI VII and VIII prices of basic commodities in particular grain rose sharply.5572 With Egypts economy getting weaker Ramesses VI turned to usurping the statues and monuments of his forebears frequently plastering and then carving his cartouches over theirs73 in particular those of Ramesses IV which figured prominently along the processional routes in Karnak and Luxor.6674 In other examples he usurped a statue of Ramesses IVnote 1575 columns of texts inscribed by Ramesses IV on an obelisk of Thutmose I in Karnak and the tomb of Ramesses V. Kitchen warns not to overinterpret these usurpations as signs of antagonism on behalf of Ramesses VI with respect to his older brother and nephew.76 The usurpations were not thorough but were rather targeted to the most prominent places where Ramesses VIs cartouches would be most visible.76 Besides Ramesses VI did leave cartouches of Ramesses IV intact in many places including in places where both his name and that of his brother feature close to one another such as in the Medinet Habu temple of Ramesses III so that the hypothesis of a damnatio memoriaewhereby all references to someone are systematically eliminated so as to remove this person from memory and historycan be eliminated.76 A possible evidence for genuine architectural works on Ramesses VIs behalf is found in Memphis where an inscription on a granite gateway cornice of the temple of Ptah claims that he erected a great pylon of fine stone. Ramesses VI then boasts of covering all the land with great monuments in my name ... built in honour of my fathers the gods.77 Overall the Egyptologist Amin Amer characterises Ramesses VI as a king who wished to pose as a great pharaoh in an age of unrest and decline.78 Dilution of poweredit High officialsedit Some high officials of Ramesses VI are known such as his finance minister and overseer of the treasury Montuemtawynote 16 who was in office since the end of Ramesses IIIs reign the vizier Neferronpe in office since Ramesses IVs time on the throne his son the vizier Nehy Amenmose the mayor of Thebes and the kings butler Qedren.79 To the south the troop commander of Kush was Nebmarenakhte80 and the administrator of Wawatthe land between the first and second cataracts of the Nilemayor of Anba and controller of the Temple of Horus at Derr81 was Penne.80 The dynasty of Ramessesnakhtedit Ramessesnakht high priest of Amun during Ramesses VIs reign shown at the Egyptian Museum In Thebes the highpriesthood came under the control of Ramessesnakht and his family at the time of Ramesses IV possibly owing to Ramessesnakhts father Merybastes high control over the countrys financial institutions.82 Ramessesnakht was officially Ramesses VIs Vizier of the South and his power grew at the expense of that of the pharaoh in spite of the fact that Iset was connected to the Amun priesthood as well in her role as Gods Wife of Amun or Divine Adoratice.4 If fact Ramessesnakht most likely oversaw the construction of the funerary building of Iset in the tomb complex K
93.1 283 and while as the Egyptologist Daniel Polz puts it he and his relatives were the most powerful individuals in Egypt at the end of the Twentieth Dynasty his activities were not directed against royal interests.83 Ramessesnakht often attended the distribution of supplies to workmen and controlled much of the activity connected with the construction of the kings tomb possibly because the treasury of the highpriest of Amun was now at least partially funding these works. Ramessesnakhts son Usermarenakhte was made into the Steward of Amun and became administrator of large swaths of land in Middle Egypt. He also inherited the role of Merybaste as controller of the countrys taxes ensuring that Ramessesnakhts family was in full control of both the royal treasury and the treasury of Amun.84 Further high offices such as those of the second and third priests and of gods father of Amun were given to people who entered Ramesesnakhts family by marriage.36 Ramessesnakht was powerful enough to build for himself one of the largest funerary establishments of the entire Theban necropolis at the end of the New Kingdom when royal building projects including Ramesses VIs usurped mortuary temple had been abandoned.85 Ramessesnakhts monument in Dra Abu elNaga reused an earlier building dating back to the Seventeenth or Eighteenth Dynasty and was refurbished to show the political and economic standing of its owner.83 Overall Egyptologists now estimate that Ramessesnakht and his dynasty essentially established a second centre of power in Upper Egypt seemingly on the behalf of the Twentieth Dynasty kings who ruled from Memphis and PiRamesses in Lower Egypt.83 This effectively made Thebes into the religious capital of Egypt as well as an administrative one on a par with its northern counterpart83 laying the foundations for the rise of the Twentyfirst Dynasty under Herihor and Pinedjem I 50 to 70 years later.86 Situation in Egypts empire abroadedit Final decline in Canaanedit This broken bust of Ramesses VI is shown at the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon. Egypts political and economic decline continued unabated during Ramesses VIs reign. He is the last king of the New Kingdom period whose name is attested on inscribed wall fragments as well as two pillars of the temple of Hathor87 of the Serabit elKhadim in Sinai884 where he sent expeditions to mine copper ore.29 Egypt may nonetheless still have wielded some sort of influence or at least still had some connections with the remnants of its empire in the Levant29 as suggested by the base of a fragmented bronze statue of Ramesses VI discovered in Megiddo in Canaan899091 and a scarab of his from Alalakh on the coast in southern Anatolia.note 1779 Egyptian presence in Canaan was terminated during or soon after Ramesses VIs rule9293 with the last garrisons leaving southern and western Palestine around the time94 and the frontier between Egypt and abroad returning to a fortified line joining the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.79 A 2017 archaeological study reached the same conclusion namely that Ramesses VIs reign is the terminus post quem for the presence of the Egyptian military in Jaffa which was twice destroyed around this time period.95 Opponents of the Egyptian authority were of local extraction probably originating in Canaanite cities of the Levantine coastal plain96 an opposition to Egyptian hegemony ultimately resulting from the arrival of the Sea People in the region during the reign of Ramesses III.9798 The loss of all Asiatic territories further strained the redistributive economy of Egypts New Kingdom society depriving the subsequent kings of much of their legitimacy.98 Continuing presence in Nubiaedit The Egyptian control of Nubia seems to have been much firmer at the time owing either to the advanced Egyptianisation of the local population99 or to the economic importance of this region.94 Ramesses VIs cartouches have been uncovered on Sehel Island near Aswan100 and in Ramesses IIs temple in Wadi esSebua.80 Ramesses VI is mentioned in the tomb of Penne in Anba99 not far from the Third Cataract of the Nile.29 Penne also recounts punitive military raids further south from which he claims to have brought back loot to pharaoh.69 Funerary monumentsedit Tombedit Main article KV9 Ramesses VIs mummy was damaged by grave robbers. Ramesses VI was buried in the Valley of the Kings in a tomb now known as KV
9.2 9 The tomb was first built for Ramesses V who may have been buried in it for the short period of time necessary for another likely undecorated tomb to be cut for him somewhere else in the Valley of Kings152 and which remains to be discovered.101 In any case Ramesses VI commanded that KV9 be entirely refurbished for himself with no space left for Ramesses Vs permanent burial who was finally led to rest in Ramesses VIs second year on the throne possibly because stability had returned to Thebes at the time.129 The usurpation of Ramesses Vs tomb may be a sign that Ramesses VI did not hold his predecessor in high regard which would explain why he had Ramesses Vs name obliterated and replaced by his own on more than one occasion.102 Alternatively it may reflect the kings pragmatic concern for economical measures.66 Ushabti of Ramesses VI in the British Museum The renewed works on KV9 are responsible for the preservation of the tomb of Tutankhamun the entrance of which was buried beneath huts built for the craftsmen working on Ramesses VIs tomb.103 These works seem to have been completed during Ramesses VIs sixth year of reign at which point Ramessesnakht received 600 debens of blunted copper tools in the great forecourt of Amun in Karnak probably indicating the end of the construction works on the tomb.66 Furthermore if the Theban ostracon 18
60 a does refer to Ramesses VI and not Ramesses X then it indicates that the tomb was finally ready for the king in his eighth year on the throne at which point he might have been ill and nearing death.78 Once finished the tomb was 104 m 341 ftlong104 and included one of only three complete renditions of the Book of Gates known from royal funerary contextnote 18105 as well as a complete version of the Book of Caverns.105 Within 20 years106 of Ramesses VIs burial the tomb was most probably desecrated and ransacked by grave robbers who hacked away at the hands and feet of Ramesses mummy to gain access to his jewelry. These events occurring during the reign of Ramesses XI107 are described in the Papyrus Mayer B although the identification of the tomb mentioned in this source is not entirely certain.29 Ramesses VIs mummy was subsequently moved to the tomb KV35 of Amenhotep II during the reign of Pinedjem of the early TwentyFirst Dynasty108 where it was discovered in 1898 by Victor Loret.109 A medical examination of the mummy revealed that Ramesses VI died aged around forty70 and showed severe damage to his body the head and torso being broken into several pieces by an axe used by the tomb robbers.46 In 1898 Georges mile Jules Daressy cleared KV9 which had remained opened since antiquity uncovering fragments of a large granite box as well as numerous pieces of Ramesses VIs mummiform stone sarcophagus the face of which is now in the British Museum.104 The sarcophagus was restored in 2004 following two years of work on over 250 fragments recovered in the tomb where it is now on display. Zahi Hawass then head of Egypts Supreme Council of Antiquities unsuccessfully requested the return of the sarcophagus face from the British Museum to Egypt.110 In 2020 the Egyptian Tourism Authority released a full 
3 D model of the tomb with detailed photographies available online.111 In April 2021 his mummy was moved from the Egyptian Museum to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs Golden Parade. 112 Mortuary templeedit Ramesses VI seems to have usurped the large mortuary temple in ElAssasif from Ramesses V who had himself likely taken it from his father Ramesses IV.79113 The temple was planned to be nearly half the size of that of Medinet Habu and was only in its foundation stages at the death of Ramesses IV.90 It is unclear whether it was ever completed but the temple is mentioned as a landowning institution in the Wilbour Papyrus dating to Ramesses Vs reign.70 Archaeological excavations show much of its surviving decoration was made under Ramesses VI.note 19114 Notes and referencesedit Notesedit  The C in this name is not part of Ramesses VIs original Egyptian name rather it is a denomination added in modern Egyptology to distinguish him from other people of the same name Amenherkhepshef A a son of Ramesses II Amenherkhepshef B a son of Ramesses III and Amenherkhepshef D a son of Ramesses VI.  That the relief was left unfinished with no text during Ramesses IIIs reign is indicated by the fact that the text refers to various princes as pharaoh and coincides with modification of the princes figures to add royal attributes. In addition all of the princesses are still lacking their names which were never added.9  Ramesses VI was the second prince to bear the name Amunherkhepeshef. Consequently he is sometimes referred to as Amunherkhepeshef II in modern Egyptology.4  The publication which led to the modern consensus on Ramesses VIs filiation is due to the Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen who offered a point by point rebuttal of the arguments hitherto advanced by Kurt Sethe and others to posit that Ramesses VI was a grandson of Ramesses III rather than his son. First Kitchen rejects the initial interpretation of the titles borne by princes on the relief in particular Sethes reading of the title of kings first born son is provably wrong as several princes bore the title which should be understood as kings eldest surviving son. It follows that Sethes rejection of princes Praherwonmefs as sons of Ramesses III is invalid and that the relief can present sons of this king.14 Second Sethe rejected the filiation of Ramesses VI on the basis that it would be unlikely if not impossible that several sons of Ramesses III bore the same name Amunherkhepeshef and therefore that the two mentions of this name on the relief refer to the same Ramesses VI which would be suspect for a list of princes. Kitchen points out wellknown examples including princes Meryre I and II on a relief presenting sons of Ramesses II showing that instead it was common for several sons of kings to bear the same name and thus that the two Amunherkhepeshef are distinct persons.14 Third Sethe thought it improbable that three sons of a ruler could have ascended the throne. Kitchen points out the short reigns of the rulers of the 
20 th Dynasty after Ramesses III so that the proposed sons ruled within 20 years of their fathers death far from impossible.15 Fourth Kitchen points out the wrong argument that the cartouche next to Ramesses IVs figure simply reads Ramesses which this ruler would have deemed insufficient to distinguish himself and thus that the figure is not Ramesses IV but someone else. As noted by Kitchen the titles given to this figure are sufficient to identify Ramesses IV beyond doubt.15 Fifth Sethe and others believe that Ramesses VI implemented a damnatio memoriae against Ramesses IV and V which they explain through complicated dynastic struggles. But this damnatio memoriae is in the terms of Kitchen wholly imaginary and indeed archaeological evidence has since established that Ramesses VI only erased the cartouches of his predecessor to gain visibility for his and not in any systematic manner.15 Lastly Sethe and Peet pointed out that in her tomb Ramesses VIs mother is not given the title of kings wife and thus deduce that Ramesses VI was the son of a nonroyal father. But Kitchen points out that this absence is no evidence for example Ramesses IIs mother herself is never given the title of kings wife in her tomb yet it is well established that she was Sethi Is queen.16  The filiation of Panebenkemyt is established by a depiction of him on a statue of his father now in the Luxor Museum.18  If the hypothesis regarding Ramesses IXs filiation is correct then Kitchen adds that queen Tyti might have been a daughter of Ramesses VI the wife of Ramesses IX and mother of Ramesses X.24 New evidence emerging from the publication of tombrobbers accounts in 2010 established that Tyti was in fact the wife and sister of Ramesses III and possibly the mother of Ramesses IV.25  Known today as Ostracon IFAO 14
25.4 0  That the king in question is Ramesses VI is established by the dates recorded on the ostracon. It is mentioned that the first loan occurred on Year 7 I Peret 18 that is on the 
18 th day of the first month of the season of Peret in the kings 
7 th year of reign while the second took place on Year 8 II Peret 11. Furthermore the short duration of the loans which amounted to 15 days strongly suggest that these dates occurred in immediate succession and thus that they belong to the same reign. This indicates that the king referred to had ascended the throne between the 
18 th day of the first month of Peret and the 
11 th day of the second month of the same season. But the only king of the 
19 th and 
20 th Dynasties who ascended the throne in such a timeframe is Ramesses VI.3940  While the exact date of Ramesses VIs coronation is unknown ancient sources indicate that he must have started his reign in winter between the 
28 th day of the first month of the Season of the Emergence and the 
11 th day the second month of the same season.4748 Janssen has more specifically argued for an accession of the eighth day of the second month of this season.49  The location of PerNebyt is not known for certain. It may have been in northThebes.1  erns argument is that the term employed in the source to refer to the enemy is not the term that would be employed for foreign marauders such as Libyans. As a consequence he sees the troublemakers as Egyptians. Since furthermore the chief of the Medjay of Thebes seems not to have been involved in fighting the enemy ern believes that the troubles came from the North. ern further conjectures that the civil war was a struggle between followers of Ramesses V and Ramesses VI whom he sees as antagonists.51 Against this hypothesis is the observation that several highofficials continued their careers without disturbances from the time of Ramesses III until that of Ramesses VI and beyond suggesting that the state was in fact politically stable.1  This is indicated by a text on the verso of Ostracon Berlin P. 12654 which reads So says the vizier leave these sixty men here in the gang whomsoever you choose and send the rest away. Order that they should become conscript labour who carry supplies for you.51  Tombs dating to the Twentieth Dynasty but which cannot be securely attributed to any specific reign are QV 24 41 45 50 54 84 85 86. This list may include those built by Ramesses VI.59  Small artefacts bearing Ramesses VIs cartouches are also known including bronze and gold signet rings now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Arts.70  The statue was found in the Karnak cache and is now in the Egyptian Museum under the catalogue number 421
53.7 5  Also called Mentemtowy in the modern literature.79  The finds of the statue and scarab in Megiddo and Alalakh do not necessarily denote any strong Egyptian presence there as these kinds of artefacts were widely traded throughout the Mediterranean at the time.79  The other renditions are found in the tomb of Seti I and in the Osireion.105  That is most of the decorations of the temple that have survived to this day have been made under Ramesses VI as shown by the presence of his cartouches on these decorations.114 Referencesedit  a b c d e f g h i j k l m Amer 1985 p. 67.  a b c d Leprohon 2013 p. 199.  a b Clayton 1994 p. 167.  a b c d e f Grimal 1992 p. 288.
