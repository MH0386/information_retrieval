18 thpresent Egyptian Revival is an architectural style that uses the motifs and imagery of ancient Egypt. It is attributed generally to the public awareness of ancient Egyptian monuments generated by Napoleons conquest of Egypt and Admiral Nelsons defeat of the French Navy at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. Napoleon took a scientific expedition with him to Egypt. Publication of the expeditions work the Description de lgypte began in 1809 and was published as a series through 1826. The size and monumentality of the faades discovered during his adventure cemented the hold of Egyptian aesthetics on the Parisian elite. However works of art and architecture such as funerary monuments in the Egyptian style had been made or built occasionally on the European continent since the time of the Renaissance. Historyedit Egyptian influence before Napoleonedit Much of the early knowledge about ancient Egyptian arts and architecture was filtered through the lens of the Classical world including ancient Rome. Prior to Napoleons influence an early example is the Obelisk of Domitian erected in 1651 by Bernini on top of the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi in Piazza Navona Rome which went on to inspire several Egyptian obelisks constructed in Ireland during the early 
18 th century. It influenced the obelisk constructed as a family funeral memorial by Sir Edward Lovett Pearce for the Allen family at Stillorgan in Ireland in 1717 one of several Egyptian obelisks erected in Ireland during the early 
18 th century. Others may be found at Belan County Kildare and Dangan County Meath. Conollys Folly in County Kildare is probably the best known albeit the least Egyptianstyled. Egyptian buildings had also been built as garden follies. The most elaborate was probably the one built by Duke Frederick I of Wrttemberg in the gardens of the Chteau de Montbliard. It included an Egyptian bridge across which guests walked to reach an island with an elaborate Egyptianinfluenced bath house. Designed by JeanBaptiste Klber later French commander in Egypt the building had a billiards room and a bagnio. During the 
2 nd half of the 
18 th century with the rise of Neoclassicism sometimes architects mixed the Ancient Greek Roman and Egyptian styles. They wanted to discover new shape and ornament ideas rather than to be just faithful copyists of the past.1 Pyramid of Cestius Rome by Gaius Cestius c.12 BC Renaissance monument to Lavinia Thiene with an Egyptianinspired pyramid on it Vicenza Cathedral Vicenza Italy by Giulio Romano 1544 Pyramid grave churchyard in Jrflla Sweden unknown architect

In France and Britain this was at least partially inspired by successful war campaigns undertaken by each country while in Egypt. For Napoleons intention of cataloguing the sights and findings from the campaign hundreds of artists and scientists were enlisted to document antiquities ethnography architecture and natural history of Egypt and later these notes and sketches were taken back to Europe. In 1803 the compilation of Description de lgypte was started based on these documents and lasted over twenty years. The content in this archaeological text includes translation of the Rosetta Stone pyramids and other scenes arouse interests in Egyptian arts and culture in Europe and America. According to James Stevens Curl people started to present their imaginations about Egypt in various ways. First combinations of crocodiles pyramids mummies sphinxes and other motifs were widely circulated. In 1800 an Egyptian opera festival was staged in Drury Lane London with Egyptianthemed sets and costumes. On the other hand William Capon 17571827 suggested a massive pyramid for Shooters Hill as a National Monument while George Smith 17831869 designed an Egyptianstyle tomb for Ralph Abercromby in Alexandria. According to David Brownlee the 1798 Karlsruhe Synagogue an early building by the influential Friedrich Weinbrenner was the first large Egyptian building to be erected since antiquity.9 According to Diana Muir it was the first public building that is not a folly stage set or funeral monument in the Egyptian revival style.10 The ancient Egyptian influence was mainly shown in the two large engaged pylons flanking the entrance otherwise the windows and entrance of the central section were pointed arches and the overall plan conventional with NeoGothic details. Among the earliest monuments of the Egyptian Revival in Paris is the Fontaine du Fellah built in 1806. It was designed by FranoisJean Bralle. A welldocumented example destroyed after Napoleon was deposed was the monument to General Louis Desaix in the Place des Victoires was built in 1810. It featured a nude statue of the general and an obelisk both set upon an Egyptian Revival base.11 Another example of a still standing site of Egyptian Revival is the Egyptian Gate of Tsarskoe Selo built in 1829. A street or passage named the Place du Caire or Foire du Caire Fair of Cairo was built in Paris in 1798 on the former site of the convent of the Filles de la Charit. No. 2 Place du Caire from 1828 is essentially in overall form a conventional Parisian structure with shops on the ground floor and apartments above but with considerable Egyptianizing decoration including a row of massive Hathor heads and a frieze by sculptor J. G. Garraud.12 One of the first British buildings to show an Egyptian Revival interior was the newspaper office of the Courier on the Strand London. It was built in 1804 and featured a cavetto coved cornice and Egyptianinfluenced columns with palmiform capitals.13 Other early British examples include the Egyptian Hall in London completed in 1812 and the Egyptian Dining Room at Goodwood House 1806. There was also the Egyptian Gallery a private room in the home of connoisseur Thomas Hope to display his Egyptian antiquities and illustrated in engravings from his meticulous line drawings in his book Household Furniture 1807 were a prime source for the Regency style of British furnishings.

19 th century including the 1835 Moyamensing Prison Philadelphia Pennsylvania United States the 1836 Fourth District Police Station in New Orleans and the 1838 New York City jail known as the Tombs. Other public buildings in Egyptian style included the 1844 Old Whalers Church in Sag Harbor New York the 1846 First Baptist Church of Essex Connecticut the 1845 Egyptian Building of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond and the 1848 United States Custom House New Orleans. The most notable Egyptian structure in the United States was the Washington Monument begun in 1848 this obelisk originally featured doors with cavetto cornices and winged sun disks later removed. The National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City Missouri is another example of Egyptian revival architecture and art.17 Around the 18
70 s Americans started to become interested in other cultures including those of Japan the Middle East and North Africa leading to a second period of interest in Egyptian revival. Egyptian motifs and symbols were commonly used in the design including elements of gilt bronze fittings shaped like sphinxes Egyptian scenes woven into textiles and geometric renderings of plants such as palm fronds.18 Some Americans in the 18
80 s believed that the United States was a nation without art and therefore wanted to innovate in the field of aesthetic design to distinguish it from Egyptian pyramids and obelisks Greek temples and Gothic spires. But implementing such innovations was difficult and as Clarence King said Till there is an American race there cannot be an American style. The creation of the American style was also hindered by the fact that the ethnic mix of the American people did not constitute a race.19 In the time that followed however Americas own culture was assimilating Egyptian revivalist architecture and their tectonic significance became unstable. This may be because the United States of the early 
20 th century was a confident nation and the approach of defining ones own spiritual world by establishing a connection to a great civilization like ancient Egypt faded in such a cultural context.20 Other countriesedit The South African College in the thenBritish Cape Colony features an Egyptian building constructed in 1841 the Egyptian Revival building of the Cape Town Hebrew Congregation is also still standing. The York Street Synagogue was Australias first Egyptian revival building followed by the Hobart Synagogue the Launceston Synagogue and the Adelaide Hebrew Congregation all by 1850. The earliest obelisk in Australia was erected at Macquarie Place Sydney in 18

19 th and very early 
20 th century Academic paintings shows scenes from Ancient Egypt The expeditions that eventually led to the discovery in 1922 of Tutankhamuns tomb by archaeologist Howard Carter resulted in a 
20 thcentury revival. The revival during the 19
20 s is sometimes considered to be part of the Art Deco style. This phase gave birth to the Egyptian Theatre movement largely confined to the United States. The Egyptian Revival decorative arts style was present in furniture and other household objects as well as in architecture.

Although both public and private buildings were built in Britain in the Egyptian Revival style the vast majority of those with attempts at accurate inscriptions were public works or on entrances to public buildings.31 In 1824 French classical scholar and egyptologist JeanFranois Champollion published Precis du systeme hieroglyphique des anciens Egyptiens in 1824 which spurred the first notable attempts to decipher the hieroglyphic language in Britain.31 Joseph Bonomi the Youngers inscriptions in the entrance lodges to Abney Park Cemetery in 1840 was the first real recorded attempt to compose a legible text. An Egyptologist himself Bonomi and other scholars such as Samuel Birch Samuel Sharpe William Osburne and others31 would compose texts for a variety of other British projects throughout the nineteenth century including Marshalls Mill in Leeds an aedicula in the grounds of Hartwell House Buckinghamshire and as part of an Egyptian exhibition in The Crystal Palace after it was reerected in southeast London.31 The content of the inscriptions varied depending on the nature of their specific projects. The Crystal Palace exhibition features several different inscriptions with the main inscription detailing the construction and content of the hall and proclaiming it as an educational asset to the community. It ends with a message to invoke good fortune translated as let it be prosperous.31 Other smaller inscriptions on the cornice of the exhibit entrance feature the names of the builders and a message in Greek wishing for the health and wellbeing of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert31 members of the royal family. The main inscription is accompanied by an English translation with the characters spaced to match the position of the English words. However Chris Elliot notes that the translation overly relies on phonetic transliteration and features some unusual characters for words that were difficult to translate into hieroglyphs.31 List of buildingsedit North Americaedit First Presbyterian Church in Nashville Tennessee designed by William Strickland from 1849 to 1851 Washington Monument in Washington D.C.
