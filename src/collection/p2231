For example an ebook a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different ISBN. The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before 2007 and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007.c The method of assigning an ISBN is nationspecific and varies between countries often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country. The initial ISBN identification format was devised in 1967 based upon the 
9 digit Standard Book Numbering SBN created in 1966. The 
10 digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization ISO and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 the 
9 digit SBN code can be converted to a 
10 digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero. Privately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN. The International ISBN Agency sometimes assigns such books ISBNs on its own initiative.4 Another identifier the International Standard Serial Number ISSN identifies periodical publications such as magazines and newspapers. The International Standard Music Number ISMN covers musical scores. History The Standard Book Number SBN is a commercial system using ninedigit code numbers to identify books. In 1965 British bookseller and stationers WHSmith announced plans to implement a standard numbering system for its books.1 They hired consultants to work on their behalf and the system was devised by Gordon Foster emeritus professor of statistics at Trinity College Dublin.5 The International Organization for Standardization ISO Technical Committee on Documentation sought to adapt the British SBN for international use. The ISBN identification format was conceived in 1967 in the United Kingdom by David Whitaker67 regarded as the Father of the ISBN8 and in 1968 in the United States by Emery Koltay6 who later became director of the U.S. ISBN agency R. R. Bowker.8910 The 
10 digit ISBN format was developed by the ISO and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 21
08.1 6 The United Kingdom continued to use the ninedigit SBN code until 1974. ISO has appointed the International ISBN Agency as the registration authority for ISBN worldwide and the ISBN Standard is developed under the control of ISO Technical Committee 
46 Subcommittee 9 TC 
46 SC 9. The ISO online facility only refers back to 19
78.1 1 Total number of ISBN registrations. 2020 An SBN may be converted to an ISBN by prefixing the digit 0. For example the second edition of Mr. J. G. Reeder Returns published by Hodder in 1965 has SBN 340 01381 8 where 340 indicates the publisher 01381 is the serial number assigned by the publisher and 8 is the check digit. By prefixing a zero this can be converted to ISBN 0340013818 the check digit does not need to be recalculated. Some publishers such as Ballantine Books would sometimes use 
12 digit SBNs where the last three digits indicated the price of the book12 for example Woodstock Handmade Houses had a 
12 digit Standard Book Number of 345242238595 valid SBN 345242238 ISBN 034524223813 and it cost US

20.1 5 Overview A separate ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation except reprintings of a publication. For example an ebook audiobook paperback and hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different ISBN assigned to it.1612 The ISBN is thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007 and ten digits long if assigned before 2007.c3 An International Standard Book Number consists of four parts if it is a 
10 digit ISBN or five parts for a 
13 digit ISBN. Section 5 of the International ISBN Agencys official user manual1611 describes the structure of the 
13 digit ISBN as follows The parts of a 
10 digit ISBN and the corresponding EAN13 and barcode. Note the different check digits in each. The part of the EAN13 labeled EAN is the Bookland country code. for a 
13 digit ISBN a prefix element  a GS1 prefix so far 978 or 979 have been made available by GS1 the registration group element languagesharing country group individual country or territoryd the registrant element the publication element and a checksum character or check digit. A 
13 digit ISBN can be separated into its parts prefix element registration group registrant publication and check digit and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces. Separating the parts registration group registrant publication and check digit of a 
10 digit ISBN is also done with either hyphens or spaces. Figuring out how to correctly separate a given ISBN is complicated because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits.e Issuing process ISBN issuance is countryspecific in that ISBNs are issued by the ISBN registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language. The ranges of ISBNs assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number type and size of publishers that are active. Some ISBN registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from the government to support their services. In other cases the ISBN registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded.18 A full directory of ISBN agencies is available on the International ISBN Agency website.19 A list for a few countries is given below Australia  ThorpeBowker2021 Brazil  The National Library of Brazil22 Up to 28 February 202023 Brazil  Cmara Brasileira do Livro24 From 1 March 202023 Canada  English Library and Archives Canada a government agency French Bibliothque et Archives nationales du Qubec Colombia  Cmara Colombiana del Libro an NGO Hong Kong  Books Registration Office BRO under the Hong Kong Public Libraries25 Iceland  Landsbkasafn National and University Library of Iceland India  The Raja Rammohun Roy National Agency for ISBN Book Promotion and Copyright Division under Department of Higher Education a constituent of the Ministry of Human Resource Development26 Israel  The Israel Center for Libraries27 Italy  EDISER srl owned by Associazione Italiana Editori Italian Publishers Association2829 Kenya  National Library of Kenya Lebanon  Lebanese ISBN Agency Maldives  The National Bureau of Classification NBC Malta  The National Book Council Maltese IlKunsill Nazzjonali talKtieb303132 Morocco  The National Library of Morocco New Zealand  The National Library of New Zealand33 Nigeria  National Library of Nigeria Pakistan  National Library of Pakistan Philippines  National Library of the Philippines34 South Africa  National Library of South Africa Spain  Spanish ISBN Agency  Agencia del ISBN Turkey  General Directorate of Libraries and Publications a branch of the Ministry of Culture35 United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland  Nielsen Book Services Ltd part of Nielsen Holdings N.V.36 United States  R.

1 to
5 digit number that is valid within a single prefix element i.e. one of 978 or 9791611 and can be separated between hyphens such as 9781.... Registration groups have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element.38 The singledigit registration groups within the 9
78 prefix element are 0 or 1 for Englishspeaking countries 2 for Frenchspeaking countries 3 for Germanspeaking countries 4 for Japan 5 for Russianspeaking countries and 7 for Peoples Republic of China. Example 
5 digit registration groups are 99936 and 99980 for Bhutan. The allocated registration groups are 05 600631 65 7 8094 950989 99109989 and 99901999
93.3 9 Books published in rare languages typically have longer group elements.40 Within the 979 prefix element the registration group 0 is reserved for compatibility with International Standard Music Numbers ISMNs but such material is not actually assigned an ISBN.41 The registration groups within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 8 for the United States of America 10 for France 11 for the Republic of Korea and 12 for Italy.42 The original 
9 digit standard book number SBN had no registration group identifier but prefixing a zero to a 
9 digit SBN creates a valid 
10 digit ISBN. Registrant element The national ISBN agency assigns the registrant element cf. CategoryISBN agencies and an accompanying series of ISBNs within that registrant element to the publisher the publisher then allocates one of the ISBNs to each of its books. In most countries a book publisher is not legally required to assign an ISBN although most large bookstores only handle publications that have ISBNs assigned to them.434445 The International ISBN Agency maintains the details of over one million ISBN prefixes and publishers in the Global Register of Publishers.46 This database is freely searchable over the internet. Publishers receive blocks of ISBNs with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the registration group identifier several digits for the registrant and a single digit for the publication element. Once that block of ISBNs is used the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs with a different registrant element. Consequently a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements. There also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country. This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers. By using variable block lengths registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of ISBNs that they make to publishers. For example a large publisher may be given a block of ISBNs where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element likewise countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements.47 Here are some sample ISBN10 codes illustrating block length variations.

10 digit ISBN is an extension of that for SBNs so the two systems are compatible an SBN prefixed with a zero the 
10 digit ISBN will give the same check digit as the SBN without the zero. The check digit is base eleven and can be an integer between 0 and 9 or an X. The system for 
13 digit ISBNs is not compatible with SBNs and will in general give a different check digit from the corresponding 
10 digit ISBN so does not provide the same protection against transposition. This is because the 
13 digit code was required to be compatible with the EAN format and hence could not contain the letter X. ISBN10 check digits According to the 2001 edition of the International ISBN Agencys official user manual48 the ISBN10 check digit which is the last digit of the 
10 digit ISBN must range from 0 to 10 the symbol X is used for 10 and must be such that the sum of the ten digits each multiplied by its integer weight descending from 10 to 1 is a multiple of 11. That is if xi is the ith digit then x10 must be chosen such that  i  1 10  11  i  x i  0  mod 11  . displaystyle sum i110

0 pmod 11. The two most common errors in handling an ISBN e.g. when typing it or writing it down are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits. It can be proven mathematically that all pairs of valid ISBN
10 s differ in at least two digits. It can also be proven that there are no pairs of valid ISBN
10 s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits. These proofs are true because the ISBN is less than eleven digits long and because 11 is a prime number. The ISBN check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error i.e. if either of these types of error has occurred the result will never be a valid ISBN  the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11. However if the error were to occur in the publishing house and remain undetected the book would be issued with an invalid ISBN.49 In contrast it is possible for other types of error such as two altered nontransposed digits or three altered digits to result in a valid ISBN although it is still unlikely. ISBN10 check digit calculation Each of the first nine digits of the 
10 digit ISBN  excluding the check digit itself  is multiplied by its integer weight descending from 10 to 2 and the sum of these nine products found. The value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which when added to this sum means the total is a multiple of 11. For example the check digit for an ISBN10 of 030640615 is calculated as follows s   0  10    3  9    0  8    6  7    4  6    0  5    6  4    1  3    5  2   130. displaystyle beginaligneds

Therefore the check digit has to be 2 and the complete sequence is ISBN 0306406152. If the value of x 10 displaystyle x10 required to satisfy this condition is 10 then an X should be used. Alternatively modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11. The remainder of this sum when it is divided by 11 i.e. its value modulo 11 is computed. This remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11. Therefore the check digit is 11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11 modulo 11. Taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0. Without the second modulo operation the calculation could result in a check digit value of 11  0  11 which is invalid. Strictly speaking the first modulo 11 is not needed but it may be considered to simplify the calculation. For example the check digit for the ISBN of 030640615 is calculated as follows s   11     0  10    3  9    0  8    6  7    4  6    0  5    6  4    1  3    5  2   mod 11   mod 11   11    0  27  0  42  24  0  24  3  10  mod 11   mod 11   11    130  mod 11   mod 11   11   9   mod 11   2  mod 11  2 displaystyle beginaligneds1

The ISBN13 check digit which is the last digit of the ISBN must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits each multiplied by its integer weight alternating between 1 and 3 is a multiple of 10.

0 pmod 10. The calculation of an ISBN13 check digit begins with the first twelve digits of the 
13 digit ISBN thus excluding the check digit itself. Each digit from left to right is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3 then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9. Subtracted from 10 that leaves a result from 1 to 10. A zero replaces a ten so in all cases a single check digit results. For example the ISBN13 check digit of 978030640615 is calculated as follows s  91  73  81  03  31  03  61  43  01  63  11  53     9   21    8    0    3    0    6   12    0   18    1   15   9393  10  9 remainder 310   3  7 Thus the check digit is 7 and the complete sequence is ISBN 9780306406157. In general the ISBN check digit is calculated as follows. Let r   10   x 1  3 x 2  x 3  3 x 4    x 11  3 x 12  mod 1 0  . displaystyle rbig

Specifically if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5 the check digit will not catch their transposition. For instance the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1. The correct order contributes 3  6  1  1  19 to the sum while if the digits are transposed 1 followed by a 6 the contribution of those two digits will be 3  1  1  6  9. However 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10 and so produce the same final result both ISBNs will have a check digit of 7. The ISBN10 formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot but requires more than the digits 09 to express the check digit. Additionally if the sum of the

10 digit ISBN is converted to a 
13 digit ISBN by prepending 978 to the ISBN10 and recalculating the final checksum digit using the ISBN13 algorithm. The reverse process can also be performed but not for numbers commencing with a prefix other than 978 which have no 
10 digit equivalent. Errors in usage Publishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the ISBN check digit. Publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its ISBN before publishing it that failure causes book identification problems for libraries booksellers and readers.50 For example ISBN 0590764845 is shared by two books  Ninja gaiden a novel based on the bestselling game by Tecmo 1990 and Wacky laws 1997 both published by Scholastic. Most libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid ISBN issued by the publisher. The Library of Congress catalogue contains books published with invalid ISBNs which it usually tags with the phrase Cancelled ISBN.51 The International Union Library Catalog a.k.a. WorldCat OCLC  Online Computer Library Center system often indexes by invalid ISBNs if the book is indexed in that way by a member library.52 eISBN Only the term ISBN should be used the terms eISBN and eISBN have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided. If a book exists in one or more digital ebook formats each of those formats must have its own ISBN. In other words each of the three separate EPUB Amazon Kindle and PDF formats of a particular book will have its own specific ISBN. They should not share the ISBN of the paper version and there is no generic eISBN which encompasses all the ebook formats for a title.53 EAN format used in barcodes and upgrading The barcodes on a books back cover or inside a massmarket paperback books front cover are EAN13 they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an EAN5 for the currency and the recommended retail price.54 For 
10 digit ISBNs the number 978 the Bookland country code is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN13 formula modulo 10 1 and 3 weighting on alternating digits. Partly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories the International Organization for Standardization ISO decided to migrate to a 
13 digit ISBN ISBN13. The process began on 1 January 2005 and was planned to conclude on 1 January 20
07.5 5 As of 20
11 update all the 
13 digit ISBNs began with 978. As the 978 ISBN supply is exhausted the 979 prefix was introduced. Part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the Musicland code for musical scores with an ISMN. The 
10 digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an M letter the bar code represents the M as a zero and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3. All ISMNs are now thirteen digits commencing 9790 9791 to 9799 will be used by ISBN. Publisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 ISBNs likewise there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same. Moreover the 
10 digit ISBN check digit generally is not the same as the 
13 digit ISBN check digit. Because the GTIN13 is part of the Global Trade Item Number GTIN system that includes the GTIN14 the GTIN12 and the GTIN8 the 
13 digit ISBN falls within the 
14 digit data field range.56 Barcode format compatibility is maintained because aside from the group breaks the ISBN13 barcode format is identical to the EAN barcode format of existing 
10 digit ISBNs. So migration to an EANbased system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and nonbook products that is compatible with existing ISBN based data with only minimal changes to information technology systems. Hence many booksellers e.g. Barnes  Noble migrated to EAN barcodes as early as March 2005. Although many American and Canadian booksellers were able to read EAN13 barcodes before 2005 most general retailers could not read them. The upgrading of the UPC barcode system to full EAN13 in 2005 eased migration to the ISBN in North America.

Conversely books are published with several ISBNs A German secondlanguage edition of Emil und die Detektive has the ISBNs 8723901578 Denmark 0821910698 United States 9121156
28 X Sweden 0850485487 United Kingdom and 3126754953 Germany.  In some cases books sold only as sets share ISBNs. For example the Vance Integral Edition used only two ISBNs for 44 books.  a b Publishers were required to convert existing ISBNs from the 
10 digit format to the 
13 digit format in their publication records by 1 January 2007. For existing publications the new 
13 digit ISBN would only need to be added if and when a publication was reprinted. During the transition period publishers were recommended to print both the 
10 digit and 
13 digit ISBNs on the verso of a publications title page but they were required to print only the 
13 digit ISBN after 1 January 20
07.3   Some books have several codes in the first block e.g. A. M. Yagloms Correlation Theory... published by Springer Verlag has two ISBNs 0387963316 and 3540963316. Though Springers 387 and 540 codes are different for English 0 and German 3 the same item number 96331 produces the same check digit for both 6. Springer uses 431 as the publisher code for Japanese 4 and 443196331 also has a check digit of 6. Other Springer books in English have publisher code 817 and 081796331 would also have a check digit of 6. This suggests that special considerations were made for assigning Springers publisher codes as random assignments of different publisher codes would not be expected to lead by coincidence to the same check digit every time for the same item number. Finding publisher codes for English and German say with this effect would amount to solving a linear equation in modular arithmetic.original research  The International ISBN Agencys ISBN Users Manual says The tendigit number is divided into four parts of variable length which must be separated clearly by hyphens or spaces although omission of separators is permitted for internal data processing. If present hyphens must be correctly placed.17 The actual definition for hyphenation contains more than 220 different registration group elements with each one broken down into a few to several ranges for the length of the registrant element more than 1000 total. The document defining the ranges listed by agency is 29 pages. References  a b c ISBN History. isbn.org. 20 April 2014. Archived from the original on 20 April 2014. Retrieved 20 April 2014.
