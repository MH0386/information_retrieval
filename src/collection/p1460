19 th Dynasty Ramesses IIa rmsiz rmsiz rmziz Ancient Egyptian rmssw Ramassb Ancient Egyptian pronunciation iamases c.1303 BC  1213 BC7 commonly known as Ramesses the Great was an Egyptian pharaoh. He was the third ruler of the Nineteenth Dynasty. Along with Thutmose III of the Eighteenth Dynasty he is often regarded as the greatest most celebrated and most powerful pharaoh of the New Kingdom which itself was the most powerful period of ancient Egypt.8 He is also widely considered one of ancient Egypts most successful warrior pharaohs conducting no fewer than 15 military campaigns all resulting in victories excluding the Battle of Kadesh generally considered a stalemate.9 In ancient Greek sources he is called Ozymandiasc10 derived from the first part of his Egyptianlanguage regnal name Usermaatre Setepenre.d11 Ramesses was also referred to as the Great Ancestor by successor pharaohs and the Egyptian people. For the early part of his reign he focused on building cities temples and monuments. After establishing the city of PiRamesses in the Nile Delta he designated it as Egypts new capital and used it as the main staging point for his campaigns in Syria. Ramesses led several military expeditions into the Levant where he reasserted Egyptian control over Canaan and Phoenicia he also led a number of expeditions into Nubia all commemorated in inscriptions at Beit elWali and Gerf Hussein. He celebrated an unprecedented thirteen or fourteen Sed festivalsmore than any other pharaoh.12 Estimates of his age at death vary although 90 or 91 is considered to be the most likely figure.1314 Upon his death he was buried in a tomb KV7 in the Valley of the Kings15 his body was later moved to the Royal Cache where it was discovered by archaeologists in 1881. Ramesses mummy is now on display at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization located in the city of Cairo.16 Early life Ramesses II was born a civilian. His grandfather Ramesses I was a vizier and military officer during the reign of pharaoh Horemheb who appointed Ramesses I as his successor. Ramesses II was approximately eleven years old at the time of his grandfathers accession.17 Ramesses II as a child embraced by Hauron Egyptian Museum Cairo After Ramesses I died his son Seti I became king who designated his son Ramesses II as Egypts prince regent. Ramesses II was approximately fourteen years of age at the time.8 Reign length Most Egyptologists believe that Ramesses formally assumed the throne on 31 May 1279 BC based on his known accession date III Shemu day 
27.1 314 The Jewish historian Josephus in his book Contra Apionem which translated Manethos Aegyptiaca assigned Ramesses II whom he called Armesses Miamun a reign length of 66 years and 2 months.18 This figure is essentially confirmed by Papyrus Gurob fragment L where Year 67 I Akhet day 18 of Ramesses II is followed on the next dated line by a year change to Year 1 II Akhet day 19 of Ramesses IIs son Merneptah which means that Ramesses II died about 2 months into his 
67 th Regnal year.19 In 1994 A.J. Peden attempted to show that Ramesses II died in the time interval between II Akhet day 3 and II Akhet day 13 on the basis of Theban graffito 854855 which was dated to Merneptahs Year 1 II Akhet day 
2.2 0 However the workmans village of Deir elMedina preserves a fragment of a mid
20 th dynasty necropolis journal P.Turin prov.nr. 8538 recto I5 unpublished which records that the date II Akhet day 6 was a Free feast day for the Sailing of UsimaReSetepenre.ie. Ramesses II.21 As the Egyptologist Robert J. Demare notes in a 2016 paper The feast called nw  Sailing  was clearly observed in Thebes or at Deir elMedina during the Ramesside Period in remembrance of the passing of deified royals. The Sailing of AhmoseNefertari was celebrated on II Shemu 15 the Sailing of Seti I on III Shemu 24 and the Sailing of Ramesses II on II Akhet 
6.2 1 The date of Ramesses IIs recorded passing on II Akhet day 6 falls perfectly within A.J. Pedens estimated timeline for this kings death in the interval between II Akhet day 3 and II Akhet day 13. This means that Ramesses II died on Year 67 II Akhet day 6 of his reign after ruling Egypt for 66 years 2 months and 9 days. Military campaigns Early in his life Ramesses II embarked on numerous campaigns to restore possession of previously held territories lost to the Nubians and Hittites and to secure Egypts borders. He was also responsible for suppressing some Nubian revolts and carrying out a campaign in Libya. Though the Battle of Kadesh often dominates the scholarly view of Ramesses IIs military prowess and power he nevertheless enjoyed more than a few outright victories over Egypts enemies. During his reign the Egyptian army is estimated to have totaled some 100000 men a formidable force that he used to strengthen Egyptian influence.22 Battle against Sherden pirates In his second year Ramesses II decisively defeated the Sherden sea pirates who were wreaking havoc along Egypts Mediterranean coast by attacking cargoladen vessels travelling the sea routes to Egypt.23 The Sherden people probably came from the coast of Ionia from southwest Anatolia or perhaps also from the island of Sardinia.242526 Ramesses posted troops and ships at strategic points along the coast and patiently allowed the pirates to attack their perceived prey before skillfully catching them by surprise in a sea battle and capturing them all in a single action.27 A stele from Tanis speaks of their having come in their warships from the midst of the sea and none were able to stand before them. There probably was a naval battle somewhere near the mouth of the Nile as shortly afterward many Sherden are seen among the pharaohs bodyguard where they are conspicuous by their horned helmets having a ball projecting from the middle their round shields and the great Naue II swords with which they are depicted in inscriptions of the Battle of Kadesh.28 In that sea battle together with the Sherden the pharaoh also defeated the Lukka Lkkw possibly the people later known as the Lycians and the qrsw Shekelesh peoples. Syrian campaigns First Syrian campaign A relief of Ramesses II from Memphis showing him capturing enemies a Nubian a Libyan and a Syrian c.1250 BC. Cairo Museum.29 The immediate antecedents to the Battle of Kadesh were the early campaigns of Ramesses II into Canaan. His first campaign seems to have taken place in the fourth year of his reign and was commemorated by the erection of what became the first of the Commemorative stelae of Nahr elKalb near what is now Beirut. The inscription is almost totally illegible due to weathering. In the fourth year of his reign he captured the Hittite vassal state of the Amurru during his campaign in Syria.30 Second Syrian campaign Main article Battle of Kadesh The Battle of Kadesh in his fifth regnal year was the climactic engagement in a campaign that Ramesses fought in Syria against the resurgent Hittite forces of Muwatallis. The pharaoh wanted a victory at Kadesh both to expand Egypts frontiers into Syria and to emulate his father Seti Is triumphal entry into the city just a decade or so earlier. He also constructed his new capital PiRamesses. There he built factories to manufacture weapons chariots and shields supposedly producing some 1000 weapons in a week about 250 chariots in two weeks and 1000 shields in a week and a half. After these preparations Ramesses moved to attack territory in the Levant which belonged to a more substantial enemy than any he had ever faced in war the Hittite Empire.31 Ramessess forces were caught in a Hittite ambush and outnumbered at Kadesh when they counterattacked and routed the Hittites whose survivors abandoned their chariots and swam the Orontes river to reach the safe city walls.citation needed Ramesses logistically unable to sustain a long siege returned to Egypt.3233 Third Syrian campaign Egypts sphere of influence was now restricted to Canaan while Syria fell into Hittite hands. Canaanite princes seemingly encouraged by the Egyptian incapacity to impose their will and goaded on by the Hittites began revolts against Egypt. In the seventh year of his reign Ramesses II returned to Syria once again. This time he proved more successful against his Hittite foes. During this campaign he split his army into two forces. One force was led by his son Amunherkhepeshef and it chased warriors of the hasu tribes across the Negev as far as the Dead Sea capturing EdomSeir. It then marched on to capture Moab. The other force led by Ramesses attacked Jerusalem and Jericho. He too then entered Moab where he rejoined his son. The reunited army then marched on Hesbon Damascus on to Kumidi and finally recaptured Upi the land around Damascus reestablishing Egypts former sphere of influence.34 Later Syrian campaigns Main article Siege of Dapur Color reproduction of the relief depicting Ramesses II storming the Hittite fortress of Dapur Ramesses extended his military successes in his eighth and ninth years. He crossed the Dog River Nahr alKalb and pushed north into Amurru. His armies managed to march as far north as Dapur35 where he had a statue of himself erected. The Egyptian pharaoh thus found himself in northern Amurru well past Kadesh in Tunip where no Egyptian soldier had been seen since the time of Thutmose III almost 120 years earlier. He laid siege to the city before capturing it. His victory proved to be ephemeral. In year nine Ramesses erected a stele at Beth Shean. After having reasserted his power over Canaan Ramesses led his army north. A mostly illegible stele near Beirut which appears to be dated to the kings second year was probably set up there in his tenth.36 The thin strip of territory pinched between Amurru and Kadesh did not make for a stable possession. Within a year they had returned to the Hittite fold so that Ramesses had to march against Dapur once more in his tenth year. This time he claimed to have fought the battle without even bothering to put on his corslet until two hours after the fighting began. Six of Ramessess youthful sons still wearing their side locks took part in this conquest. He took towns in Retjenu37 and Tunip in Naharin38 later recorded on the walls of the Ramesseum.39 This second success at the location was equally as meaningless as his first as neither power could decisively defeat the other in battle.40 Peace treaty with the Hittites Main article EgyptianHittite peace treaty Tablet of treaty between attuili III of Hatti and Ramesses II of Egypt at the stanbul Archaeology Museums The deposed Hittite king Mursili III fled to Egypt the land of his countrys enemy after the failure of his plots to oust his uncle from the throne. attuili III responded by demanding that Ramesses II extradite his nephew back to Hatti.41 This demand precipitated a crisis in relations between Egypt and Hatti when Ramesses denied any knowledge of Mursilis whereabouts in his country and the two empires came dangerously close to war. Eventually in the twentyfirst year of his reign 1258 BC Ramesses decided to conclude an agreement with the new Hittite king attuili III at Kadesh to end the conflict. The ensuing document is the earliest known peace treaty in world history.34 The peace treaty was recorded in two versions one in Egyptian hieroglyphs the other in Hittite using cuneiform script both versions survive. Such duallanguage recording is common to many subsequent treaties. This treaty differs from others in that the two language versions are worded differently. While the majority of the text is identical the Hittite version says the Egyptians came suing for peace and the Egyptian version says the reverse.42 The treaty was given to the Egyptians in the form of a silver plaque and this pocketbook version was taken back to Egypt and carved into the temple at Karnak. The treaty was concluded between Ramesses II and attuili III in year 21 of Ramessess reign c. 1258 BC.43 Its 18 articles call for peace between Egypt and Hatti and then proceeds to maintain that their respective deities also demand peace. The frontiers are not laid down in this treaty but may be inferred from other documents. The Anastasy A papyrus describes Canaan during the latter part of the reign of Ramesses II and enumerates and names the Phoenician coastal towns under Egyptian control. The harbour town of Sumur north of Byblos is mentioned as the northernmost town belonging to Egypt suggesting it contained an Egyptian garrison.44 No further Egyptian campaigns in Canaan are mentioned after the conclusion of the peace treaty. The northern border seems to have been safe and quiet so the rule of the pharaoh was strong until Ramesses IIs death and the waning of the dynasty.45 When the King of Mira attempted to involve Ramesses in a hostile act against the Hittites the Egyptian responded that the times of intrigue in support of Mursili III had passed. attuili III wrote to KadashmanEnlil II Kassite king of Kardunia Babylon in the same spirit reminding him of the time when his father KadashmanTurgu had offered to fight Ramesses II the king of Egypt. The Hittite king encouraged the Babylonian to oppose another enemy which must have been the king of Assyria whose allies had killed the messenger of the Egyptian king. attuili encouraged KadashmanEnlil to come to his aid and prevent the Assyrians from cutting the link between the Canaanite province of Egypt and Mursili III the ally of Ramesses. Nubian campaigns Part of Gerf Hussein temple originally in Nubia Ramesses II also campaigned south of the first cataract of the Nile into Nubia. When Ramesses was about 22 two of his own sons including Amunherkhepeshef accompanied him in at least one of those campaigns. By the time of Ramesses Nubia had been a colony for 200 years but its conquest was recalled in decoration from the temples Ramesses II built at Beit elWali46 which was the subject of epigraphic work by the Oriental Institute during the Nubian salvage campaign of the 19
60 s47 Gerf Hussein and Kalabsha in northern Nubia. On the south wall of the Beit elWali temple Ramesses II is depicted charging into battle against tribes south of Egypt in a war chariot while his two young sons Amunherkhepsef and Khaemwaset are shown behind him also in war chariots. A wall in one of Ramessess temples says he had to fight one battle with those tribes without help from his soldiers.clarification needed Wall Painting of the Temple of Beit ElWali which Ramses II constructed in Nubia British Museum Libyan campaigns During the reign of Ramesses II the Egyptians were evidently active on a 3
00 kilometre 190 mi stretch along the Mediterranean coast at least as far as Zawyet Umm El Rakham where remains of a fortress described by its texts as built on Libyans land have been found.48 Although the exact events surrounding the foundation of the coastal forts and fortresses is not clear some degree of political and military control must have been held over the region to allow their construction. There are no detailed accounts of Ramesses IIs undertaking large military actions against the Libyans only generalised records of his conquering and crushing them which may or may not refer to specific events that were otherwise unrecorded. It may be that some of the records such as the Aswan Stele of his year 2 are harking back to Ramessess presence on his fathers Libyan campaigns. Perhaps it was Seti I who achieved this supposed control over the region and who planned to establish the defensive system in a manner similar to how he rebuilt those to the east the Ways of Horus across Northern Sinai. Sed festivals Main article Sed festival After reigning for 30 years Ramesses joined a select group that included only a handful of Egypts longestlived rulers. By tradition in the 
30 th year of his reign Ramesses celebrated a jubilee called the Sed festival. These were held to honour and rejuvenate the pharaohs strength.49 Only halfway through what would be a 
66 year reign Ramesses had already eclipsed all but a few of his greatest predecessors in his achievements. He had brought peace maintained Egyptian borders and built great and numerous monuments across the empire. His country was more prosperous and powerful than it had been in nearly a century. Sed festivals traditionally were held again every three years after the 
30 th year Ramesses II who sometimes held them after two years eventually celebrated an unprecedented thirteen or fourteen.50 Building projects and monuments In the third year of his reign Ramesses started the most ambitious building project after the pyramids which were built almost 1500 years earlier. The population was put to work changing the face of Egypt. Ramesses built extensively from the Delta to Nubia covering the land with buildings in a way no monarch before him had.51 Colossal Statue of Ramesses II in the first peristyle court at Luxor Some of the activities undertaken were focused on remodeling or usurping existing works improving masonry techniques and using art as propaganda. In Thebes the ancient temples were transformed so that each one of them reflected honour to Ramesses as a symbol of his putative divine nature and power. The elegant but shallow reliefs of previous pharaohs were easily transformed and so their images and words could easily be obliterated by their successors. Ramesses insisted that his carvings be deeply engraved into the stone which made them not only less susceptible to later alteration but also made them more prominent in the Egyptian sun reflecting his relationship with the sun deity Ra. Ramesses used art as a means of propaganda for his victories over foreigners which are depicted on numerous temple reliefs. His cartouches are prominently displayed even in buildings that he did not construct.52 He founded a new capital city in the Delta during his reign called PiRamesses. It previously had served as a summer palace during Seti Is reign.53 Ramesses II expanded gold mining operations in Akuyati modern day Wadi Allaqi.54 Ramesses also undertook many new construction projects. Two of his biggest works besides PiRamesses were the temple complex of Abu Simbel and the Ramesseum a mortuary temple in western Thebes. PiRamesses Main article PiRamesses Ramesses II moved the capital of his kingdom from Thebes in the Nile valley to a new site in the eastern Delta. His motives are uncertain although he possibly wished to be closer to his territories in Canaan and Syria. The new city of PiRamesses or to give the full name PiRamesses Aanakhtu meaning Domain of Ramesses Great in Victory55 was dominated by huge temples and his vast residential palace complete with its own zoo. In the 
10 th century AD the Bible exegete Rabbi Saadia Gaon believed that the biblical site of Ramesses had to be identified with Ain Shams.56 For a time during the early 
20 th century the site was misidentified as that of Tanis due to the amount of statuary and other material from PiRamesses found there but it now is recognized that the Ramesside remains at Tanis were brought there from elsewhere and the real PiRamesses lies about 30 km 
18.6  mi south near modern Qantir.57 The colossal feet of the statue of Ramesses are almost all that remains above ground today. The rest is buried in the fields.55 Ramesseum Main article Ramesseum The remains of the Ramesseum in aerial view The temple complex built by Ramesses II between Qurna and the desert has been known as the Ramesseum since the 
19 th century. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus marveled at the gigantic temple now no more than a few ruins.58 Oriented northwest and southeast the temple was preceded by two courts. An enormous pylon stood before the first court with the royal palace at the left and the gigantic statue of the king looming up at the back. Only fragments of the base and torso remain of the syenite statue of the enthroned pharaoh 17 metres 56 ft high and weighing more than 1000 tonnes 980 long tons 1100 short tons. Scenes of the great pharaoh and his army triumphing over the Hittite forces fleeing before Kadesh are represented on the pylon. Remains of the second court include part of the internal facade of the pylon and a portion of the Osiride portico on the right. Scenes of war and the alleged rout of the Hittites at Kadesh are repeated on the walls. In the upper registers feast and honor of the phallic deity Min god of fertility. On the opposite side of the court the few Osiride pillars and columns still remaining may furnish an idea of the original grandeur.59 Scattered remains of the two statues of the seated king also may be seen one in pink granite and the other in black granite which once flanked the entrance to the temple. Thirtynine out of the fortyeight columns in the great hypostyle hall 41  31 m still stand in the central rows. They are decorated with the usual scenes of the king before various deities.60 Part of the ceiling decorated with gold stars on a blue ground also has been preserved. Ramessess children appear in the procession on the few walls left. The sanctuary was composed of three consecutive rooms with eight columns and the tetrastyle cell. Part of the first room with the ceiling decorated with astral scenes and few remains of the second room are all that is left. Vast storerooms built of mud bricks stretched out around the temple.59 Traces of a school for scribes were found among the ruins.61 A temple of Seti I of which nothing remains beside the foundations once stood to the right of the hypostyle hall.60 Abu Simbel Main article Abu Simbel temples Facade of the Great Temple at Abu Simbel In 1255 BC Ramesses and his queen Nefertari had traveled into Nubia to inaugurate a new temple the great Abu Simbel. It is ego cast into stone the man who built it intended not only to become Egypts greatest pharaoh but also one of its deities.62 The great temple of Ramesses II at Abu Simbel was discovered in 1813 by the Swiss Orientalist and traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. An enormous pile of sand almost completely covered the facade and its colossal statues blocking the entrance for four more years. The Paduan explorer Giovanni Battista Belzoni reached the interior on 4 August 18
17.6 3 Other Nubian monuments As well as the temples of Abu Simbel Ramesses left other monuments to himself in Nubia. His early campaigns are illustrated on the walls of the Temple of Beit elWali now relocated to New Kalabsha. Other temples dedicated to Ramesses are Derr and Gerf Hussein also relocated to New Kalabsha. For the temple of Amun at Jebel Barkal the temples foundation probably occurred during the reign of Thutmose III while the temple was shaped during his reign and that of Ramesses II.64 Other archeological discoveries Granite statue of Ramesses II from Thebes. Currently on display at the Museo Egizio in Turin The colossal statue of Ramesses II dates back 3200 years and was originally discovered in six pieces in a temple near Memphis. Weighing some 
83 tonne 
82 longton 
91 shortton it was transported reconstructed and erected in Ramesses Square in Cairo in 1955. In August 2006 contractors relocated it to save it from exhaust fumes that were causing it to deteriorate.65 The new site is near the future Grand Egyptian Museum.66 In 2018 a group of archeologists in Cairos Matariya neighborhood discovered pieces of a booth with a seat that based on its structure and age may have been used by Ramesses.6768 The royal compartment consists of four steps leading to a cubic platform which is believed to be the base of the kings seat during celebrations or public gatherings such as Ramesses inauguration and Sed festivals. It may have also gone on to be used by others in the Ramesside Period according to the missions head. The excavation mission also unearthed a collection of scarabs amulets clay pots and blocks engraved with hieroglyphic text.68 In December 2019 a red granite royal bust of Ramesses II was unearthed by an Egyptian archaeological mission in the village of Mit Rahina in Giza. The bust depicted Ramesses II wearing a wig with the symbol Ka on his head. Its measurements were 55 cm 
21.6 5 in wide 45 cm 
17.7 1 in thick and 105 cm 
41.3 3 in long. Alongside the bust limestone blocks appeared showing Ramesses II during the HebSed religious ritual.69 This discovery is considered one of the rarest archaeological discoveries. It is the firstever Ka statue made of granite to be discovered. The only Ka statue that was previously found is made of wood and it belongs to one of the kings of the 
13 th dynasty of ancient Egypt which is displayed at the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square said archaeologist Mostafa Waziri. Death and burial The Egyptian scholar Manetho third century BC attributed Ramesses a reign of 66 years and 2 months.70 By the time of his death aged about 90 years Ramesses was suffering from severe dental problems and was plagued by arthritis and hardening of the arteries.71 He had made Egypt rich from all the supplies and bounty he had collected from other empires. He had outlived many of his wives and children and left great memorials all over Egypt. Nine more pharaohs took the name Ramesses in his honour. Mummy Main article KV7 Originally Ramesses II was buried in the tomb KV7 in the Valley of the Kings72 but because of looting priests later transferred the body to a holding area rewrapped it and placed it inside the tomb of queen Ahmose Inhapy.73 Seventytwo hours later it was again moved to the tomb of the high priest Pinedjem II. All of this is recorded in hieroglyphics on the linen covering the body of the coffin of Ramesses II.74 His mummy was eventually discovered in 1881 in TT320 inside an ordinary wooden coffin and is now in Cairos National Museum of Egyptian Civilization until 3 April 2021 it was in the Egyptian Museum.75 Mummy of Ramesses II The pharaohs mummy reveals an aquiline nose and strong jaw. It stands at about 
1.7  metres 5 ft 7 in.76 Gaston Maspero who first unwrapped the mummy of Ramesses II writes on the temples there are a few sparse hairs but at the poll the hair is quite thick forming smooth straight locks about five centimeters in length. White at the time of death and possibly auburn during life they have been dyed a light red by the spices henna used in embalming ... the moustache and beard are thin. ... The hairs are white like those of the head and eyebrows ... the skin is of earthy brown splotched with black ... the face of the mummy gives a fair idea of the face of the living king.7778 In 1975 Maurice Bucaille a French doctor examined the mummy at the Cairo Museum and found it in poor condition. French President Valry Giscard dEstaing succeeded in convincing Egyptian authorities to send the mummy to France for treatment. In September 1976 it was greeted at ParisLe Bourget Airport with full military honours befitting a king then taken to a laboratory at the Muse de lHomme.798081 The mummy was forensically tested in 1976 by PierreFernand Ceccaldi the chief forensic scientist at the Criminal Identification Laboratory of Paris. Ceccaldi observed that the mummy had slightly wavy red hair from this trait combined with cranial features he concluded that Ramesses II was of a Berber type and hence  according to Ceccaldis analysis  fairskinned.8283 Subsequent microscopic inspection of the roots of Ramesses IIs hair proved that the kings hair originally was red which suggests that he came from a family of redheads.8485 This has more than just cosmetic significance in ancient Egypt people with red hair were associated with the deity Set the slayer of Osiris and the name of Ramesses IIs father Seti I means follower of Seth.86 Ramesses II was issued an Egyptian passport in 1975 when his mummy left the country for antifungal cleaning in France.87 However Cheikh Anta Diop disputed the results of the study and argued that the structure of hair morphology cannot determine the ethnicity of a mummy and that a comparative study should have featured Nubians in Upper Egypt before a conclusive judgement was reached.88 In 2006 French police arrested a man who tried to sell several tufts of Ramesses hair on the Internet. JeanMichel Diebolt said he had gotten the relics from his late father who worked on the analysis team in the 19
70 s. They were returned to Egypt the following year.89 During the examination scientific analysis revealed battlewounds old fractures arthritis and poor circulation.citation needed Ramesses IIs arthritis is believed to have made him walk with a hunched back for the last decades of his life.90 A 2004 study excluded ankylosing spondylitis as a possible cause and proposed diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis as a possible alternative91 which was confirmed by more recent work.92 A significant hole in the pharaohs mandible was detected. Researchers observed an abscess by his teeth which was serious enough to have caused death by infection although this cannot be determined with certainty.90 After being irradiated in an attempt to eliminate fungi and insects the mummy was returned from Paris to Egypt in May 19
77.9 3 In April 2021 his mummy was moved from the Egyptian Museum to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs Golden Parade.16 Burial of wives and relatives Tomb of Nefertari Main article Tomb of Nefertari Tomb wall depicting Nefertari The tomb of the most important consort of Ramesses was discovered by Ernesto Schiaparelli in 19
04.5 963 Although it had been looted in ancient times the tomb of Nefertari is extremely important because its magnificent wallpainting decoration is regarded as one of the greatest achievements of ancient Egyptian art. A flight of steps cut out of the rock gives access to the antechamber which is decorated with paintings based on chapter seventeen of the Book of the Dead. The astronomical ceiling represents the heavens and is painted in dark blue with a myriad of golden fivepointed stars. The east wall of the antechamber is interrupted by a large opening flanked by representation of Osiris at the left and Anubis at the right this in turn leads to the side chamber decorated with offeringscenes preceded by a vestibule in which the paintings portray Nefertari presented to the deities who welcome her. On the north wall of the antechamber is the stairway down to the burialchamber a vast quadrangular room covering a surfacearea of about 90 square metres 970 sq ft its astronomical ceiling supported by four pillars entirely decorated. Originally the queens red granite sarcophagus lay in the middle of this chamber. According to religious doctrines of the time it was in this chamber which the ancient Egyptians called the Golden Hall that the regeneration of the deceased took place. This decorative pictogram of the walls in the burialchamber drew inspiration from chapters 144 and 146 of the Book of the Dead in the left half of the chamber there are passages from chapter 144 concerning the gates and doors of the kingdom of Osiris their guardians and the magic formulas that had to be uttered by the deceased in order to go past the doors.63 Tomb KV5 Main article KV5 See also List of children of Ramesses II In 1995 Professor Kent Weeks head of the Theban Mapping Project rediscovered Tomb KV5. It has proven to be the largest tomb in the Valley of the Kings and originally contained the mummified remains of some of this kings estimated 52 sons. Approximately 150 corridors and tomb chambers have been located in this tomb as of 2006 and the tomb may contain as many as 200 corridors and chambers.94 It is believed that at least four of Ramessess sons including Meryatum Sety Amunherkhepeshef Ramessess firstborn son and the Kings Principal Son of His Body the Generalissimo Ramesses justified i.e. deceased were buried there from inscriptions ostraca or canopic jars discovered in the tomb.95 Joyce Tyldesley writes that thus far no intact burials have been discovered and there have been little substantial funeral debris thousands of potsherds faience ushabti figures beads amulets fragments of Canopic jars of wooden coffins ... but no intact sarcophagi mummies or mummy cases suggesting that much of the tomb may have been unused. Those burials which were made in KV5 were thoroughly looted in antiquity leaving little or no remains.95 In literature and the arts Ramesses is the basis for Percy Bysshe Shelleys poem Ozymandias. Diodorus Siculus gives an inscription on the base of one of his sculptures as King of Kings am I Osymandias. If anyone would know how great I am and where I lie let him surpass one of my works.96 This is paraphrased in Shelleys poem. The life of Ramesses II has inspired many fictional representations including the historical novels of the French writer Christian Jacq the Ramss series the graphic novel Watchmen in which the character of Adrian Veidt uses Ramesses II to form part of the inspiration for his alterego Ozymandias Norman Mailers novel Ancient Evenings which is largely concerned with the life of Ramesses II though from the perspective of Egyptians living during the reign of Ramesses IX and the Anne Rice book The Mummy or Ramses the Damned 1989 in which Ramesses was the main character. In The Kane Chronicles Ramesses is an ancestor of the main characters Sadie and Carter Kane. Ramesses II is one of the characters in the video game Civilization V as well as in additional downloadable content for its sequel Civilization VI. The East Village underground rock band The Fugs released their song Ramses II Is Dead My Love on their 1968 album It Crawled into My Hand Honest.97 Ramesses II is a main character in the fiction book The Heretic Queen by Michelle Moran published in 2008. It is a novel about the love story and beginning years of the marriage of Pharaoh Ramesses and Queen Nefertari during the time Pharaoh Rameses II is trying to decide who will be queen between his two wives Nefertari and Iset. Nefertari is the daughter and orphan of Queen Mutnodjmet and General Nakhtmin niece of Queen Nefertiti and Pharaoh Ankhenaten. The book is told from the perspective of Nefertari and is fiction but does deal with many historical events during the beginning of Rameses II reign and many historical people giving readers a view of what life and these historical figures may have been like. As the pharaoh in the Bibles Book of Exodus Yul Brynner in The Ten Commandments 1956 Though scholars generally do not recognize the biblical portrayal of the Exodus as an actual historical event98 various historical pharaohs have been proposed as the corresponding ruler at the time the story takes place with Ramesses II as the most popular candidate for Pharaoh of the Exodus. He is cast in this role in the 1944 novella The Tables of the Law by Thomas Mann. Although not a major character Ramesses appears in Joan Grants So Moses Was Born a firstperson account from Nebunefer the brother of Ramose which paints a picture of the life of Ramose from the death of Seti replete with the power play intrigue and assassination plots of the historical record and depicting the relationships with Bintanath Tuya Nefertari and Moses. In film Ramesses is played by Yul Brynner in Cecil B. DeMilles classic The Ten Commandments 1956. Here Ramesses is portrayed as a vengeful tyrant as well as the main antagonist of the film ever scornful of his fathers preference for Moses over the son of his body.99 The animated film The Prince of Egypt 1998 also features a depiction of Ramesses voiced by Ralph Fiennes for both the speaking and the singing portrayed as Moses adoptive brother and ultimately as the films villain with essentially the same motivations as in the earlier 1956 film. Joel Edgerton played Ramesses in the 2014 film Exodus Gods and Kings. Srgio Marone plays Ramesses in the 20152016 Brazilian telenovela series Os Dez Mandamentos English Moses and the Ten Commandments. In the 2013 miniseries The Bible he is portrayed by Stewart Scudamore.

40 s Egyptologists had debated the identity of the northerners coming from all lands who assisted the Libyan King Meryre in his attack upon Merneptah. Some scholars believed that Meryres auxiliaries were merely his neighbors on the Libyan coast while others identified them as IndoEuropeans from north of the Caucasus. It was one of Masperos most illustrious predecessors Emmanuel de Roug who proposed that the names reflected the lands of the northern Mediterranean the Lukka Ekwesh Tursha Shekelesh and Shardana were men from Lydia Achaea Tyrsenia western Italy Sicily and Sardinia. De Roug and others regarded Meryres auxiliariesthese peoples de la mer Mditerraneas mercenary bands since the Sardinians at least were known to have served as mercenaries already in the early years of Ramesses the Great. Thus the only migration that the Karnak Inscription seemed to suggest was an attempted encroachment by Libyans upon neighboring territory.  Gale N.H. 2011.
