His short reign was notorious for sex scandals and religious controversy. A close relative to the Severan dynasty he came from a prominent Arab family in Emesa Homs Syria where since his early youth he served as head priest of the sun god Elagabal. After the death of his cousin the emperor Caracalla Elagabalus was raised to the principate at 14 years of age in an army revolt instigated by his grandmother Julia Maesa against Caracallas shortlived successor Macrinus. He only posthumously became known by the Latinised name of his god.a Later historians suggest Elagabalus showed a disregard for Roman religious traditions and sexual taboos. He replaced the traditional head of the Roman pantheon Jupiter with the deity Elagabal of whom he had been high priest. He forced leading members of Romes government to participate in religious rites celebrating this deity presiding over them in person. He married four women including a Vestal Virgin in addition to lavishing favours on male courtiers thought to have been his lovers.56 He was also reported to have prostituted himself.7 His behavior estranged the Praetorian Guard the Senate and the common people alike. Amidst growing opposition at just 18 years of age he was assassinated and replaced by his cousin Severus Alexander in March 222. The assassination plot against Elagabalus was devised by Julia Maesa and carried out by disaffected members of the Praetorian Guard. Elagabalus developed a reputation among his contemporaries for extreme eccentricity decadence zealotry and sexual promiscuity. This tradition has persisted among writers of the early modern age he endured one of the worst reputations among Roman emperors. Edward Gibbon notably wrote that Elagabalus abandoned himself to the grossest pleasures with ungoverned fury.8 According to Barthold Georg Niebuhr the name of Elagabalus is branded in history above all others ... Elagabus had nothing at all to make up for his vices which are of such a kind that it is too disgusting even to allude to them.9 An example of a modern historians assessment is Adrian Goldsworthys Elagabalus was not a tyrant but he was an incompetent probably the least able emperor Rome had ever had.10 Despite nearuniversal condemnation of his reign some scholars write warmly about his religious innovations including the 
6 thcentury Byzantine chronicler John Malalas as well as Warwick Ball a modern historian who described him as a tragic enigma lost behind centuries of prejudice.11 Family and priesthood Further information Severan dynasty family tree An Antoninianus coin of Julia Maesa inscribed iulia maesa aug A sculpture of Julia Soaemias Elagabalus was born in 203 or 2
04 b to Sextus Varius Marcellus and Julia Soaemias Bassiana14 who had probably married around the year 200 and no later than 2
04.1 516 Elagabaluss full birth name was probably Sextus Varius Avitus Bassianusc the last name being apparently a cognomen of the Emesene dynasty.17 Marcellus was an equestrian later elevated to a senatorial position.141815 Julia Soaemias was a cousin of the emperor Caracalla and there were rumors which Soaemias later publicly supported that Elagabalus was Caracallas child.1819 Marcelluss tombstone attests that Elagabalus had at least one brother2021 about whom nothing is known.16 Elagabaluss grandmother Julia Maesa was the widow of the consul Julius Avitus Alexianus the sister of Julia Domna and the sisterinlaw of the emperor Septimius Severus.1415 Other relatives included Elagabaluss aunt Julia Avita Mamaea and uncle Marcus Julius Gessius Marcianus and their son Severus Alexander.14 Elagabaluss family held hereditary rights to the priesthood of the sun god Elagabal of whom Elagabalus was the high priest at Emesa modern Homs in Roman Syria as part of the Arab Emesene dynasty.22 The deitys Latin name Elagabalus is a Latinized version of the Arabic   Ilh alJabal from ilh god and jabal mountain meaning God of the Mountain23 the Emesene manifestation of Baal.24 Initially venerated at Emesa the deitys cult spread to other parts of the Roman Empire in the second century a dedication has been found as far away as Woerden in the Netherlands near the Roman limes.25 The god was later imported to Rome and assimilated with the sun god known as Sol Indiges in the era of the Roman Republic and as Sol Invictus during the late third century.26 In Greek the sun god is Helios hence Elagabal was later known as Heliogabalus a hybrid of Helios and Elagabalus.27 Rise to power Herodian writes that when the emperor Macrinus came to power he suppressed the threat to his reign from the family of his assassinated predecessor Caracalla by exiling themJulia Maesa her two daughters and her eldest grandson Elagabalusto their estate at Emesa in Syria.28 Almost upon arrival in Syria Maesa began a plot with her advisor and Elagabaluss tutor Gannys to overthrow Macrinus and elevate the fourteenyearold Elagabalus to the imperial throne.28 Maesa spread a rumor which Soaemias publicly supported that Elagabalus was the illegitimate child of Caracalla1929 and so deserved the loyalty of Roman soldiers and senators who had sworn allegiance to Caracalla.30 The soldiers of the Third Legion Gallica at Raphana who had enjoyed greater privileges under Caracalla and resented Macrinus and may have been impressed or bribed by Maesas wealth supported this claim.182931 At sunrise on 16 May 21832 Elagabalus was declared emperor by Publius Valerius Comazon commander of the legion.33 To strengthen his legitimacy Elagabalus adopted the same name Caracalla bore as emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.3435 Cassius Dio states that some officers tried to keep the soldiers loyal to Macrinus but they were unsuccessful.18 Reverse of an aureus of Elagabalus marked salus antonini aug the Health of Antoninus Augustus Praetorian prefect Ulpius Julianus responded by attacking the Third Legion most likely on Macrinuss orders though one account says he acted on his own before Macrinus knew of the rebellion.36 Herodian suggests Macrinus underestimated the threat considering the rebellion inconsequential.37 During the fighting Julianuss soldiers killed their officers and joined Elagabaluss forces.34 Macrinus asked the Roman Senate to denounce Elagabalus as the False Antoninus and they complied38 declaring war on Elagabalus and his family.31 Macrinus made his son Diadumenian coemperor and attempted to secure the loyalty of the Second Legion with large cash payments.3940 During a banquet to celebrate this at Apamea however a messenger presented Macrinus with the severed head of his defeated prefect Julianus.394041 Macrinus therefore retreated to Antioch after which the Second Legion shifted its loyalties to Elagabalus.3940 Elagabaluss legionaries commanded by Gannys defeated Macrinus and Diadumenian and their Praetorian Guard at the Battle of Antioch on 8 June 218 prevailing when Macrinuss troops broke ranks after he fled the battlefield.42 Macrinus made for Italy but was intercepted near Chalcedon and executed in Cappadocia while Diadumenian was captured at Zeugma and executed.39 That month Elagabalus wrote to the Senate assuming the imperial titles without waiting for senatorial approval43 which violated tradition but was a common practice among thirdcentury emperors.44 Letters of reconciliation were dispatched to Rome extending amnesty to the Senate and recognizing its laws while also condemning the administration of Macrinus and his son.45 The senators responded by acknowledging Elagabalus as emperor and accepting his claim to be the son of Caracalla.44 Elagabalus was made consul for the year 218 in the middle of June.46 Caracalla and Julia Domna were both deified by the Senate both Julia Maesa and Julia Soaemias were elevated to the rank of Augustae47 and the memory of Macrinus was expunged by the Senate.44 Elagabaluss imperial artifacts assert that he succeeded Caracalla directly.48 Comazon was appointed commander of the Praetorian Guard.4950 Elagabalus was named Pater Patriae by the Senate before 13 July 2
18.4 6 On 14 July Elagabalus was inducted into the colleges of all the Roman priesthoods including the College of Pontiffs of which he was named pontifex maximus.46 Emperor 218222 Journey to Rome and political appointments Denarius of Elagabalus inscribed imp antoninus pius aug on the obverse and fortunae aug on the reverse showing Fortuna with a cornucopia and a rudder on a globe Amphitheatrum Castrense in the Horti Spei Veteris on the Esquiline Hill in Rome The apse of the Sessorium basilica in the Horti Spei Veteris Elagabalus stayed for a time at Antioch apparently to quell various mutinies.51 Dio outlines several which historian Fergus Millar places prior to the winter of 2182
19.5 2 These included one by Gellius Maximus who commanded the Fourth Legion and was executed52 and one by Verus who commanded the Third Legion Gallica which was disbanded once the revolt was put down.53 Next according to Herodian Elagabalus and his entourage spent the winter of 218219 in Bithynia at Nicomedia and then traveled through Thrace and Moesia to Italy in the first half of 21951 the year of Elagabaluss second consulship.46 Herodian says that Elagabalus had a painting of himself sent ahead to Rome to be hung over a statue of the goddess Victoria in the Senate House so people would not be surprised by his Eastern garb but it is unclear if such a painting actually existed and Dio does not mention it.5455 If the painting was indeed hung over Victoria it put senators in the position of seeming to make offerings to Elagabalus when they made offerings to Victoria.53 On his way to Rome Elagabalus and his allies executed several prominent supporters of Macrinus such as Syrian governor Fabius Agrippinus and former Thracian governor C. Claudius Attalus Paterculianus.56 Arriving at the imperial capital in August or September 219 Elagabalus staged an adventus a ceremonial entrance to the city.46 In Rome his offer of amnesty for the Roman upper class was largely honored though the jurist Ulpian was exiled.57 Elagabalus made Comazon praetorian prefect and later consul 220 and prefect of the city three times 220222 which Dio regarded as a violation of Roman norms.56 Elagabalus himself held a consulship for the third year in a row in 2
20.4 6 Herodian and the Augustan History say that Elagabalus alienated many by giving powerful positions to other allies.58 He developed the imperial palace at Horti Spei Veteris with the inclusion of the nearby land inherited from his father Sextus Varius Marcellus. Elagabalus made it his favourite retreat and designed it as for Neros Domus Aurea project as a vast suburban villa divided into various building and landscape nuclei with the Amphitheatrum Castrense which he built and the Circus Varianus hippodrome59 fired by his unbridled passion for circuses and his habit of driving chariots inside the villa. He raced chariots under the family name of Varius.60 Dio states that Elagabalus wanted to marry a charioteer named Hierocles and to declare him caesar52 just as Dio says he had previously wanted to marry Gannys and name him caesar.52 The athlete Aurelius Zoticus is said by Dio to have been Elagabaluss lover and cubicularius a nonadministrative role while the Augustan History says Zoticus was a husband to Elagabalus and held greater political influence.61 Elagabaluss relationships to his mother Julia Soaemias and grandmother Julia Maesa were strong at first they were influential supporters from the beginning and Macrinus declared war on them as well as Elagabalus.62 Accordingly they became the first women allowed into the Senate63 and both received senatorial titles Soaemias the established title of Clarissima and Maesa the more unorthodox Mater Castrorum et Senatus Mother of the army camp and of the Senate.47 They exercised influence over the young emperor throughout his reign and are found on many coins and inscriptions a rare honour for Roman women.64 Under Elagabalus the gradual devaluation of Roman aurei and denarii continued with the silver purity of the denarius dropping from 58 to 
46.5 65 though antoniniani had a higher metal content than under Caracalla.66 Religious controversy Reverse of an aureus of Elagabalus with the baetylus transported in a quadriga. Inscription sanct deo soli elagabal to the Holy Sun God ElGabal The baetylus of Elgabal back in its home temple at Emesa on a coin of Uranius Since the reign of Septimius Severus sun worship had increased throughout the Empire.67 At the end of 220 Elagabalus instated Elagabal as the chief deity of the Roman pantheon possibly on the date of the winter solstice.46 In his official titulature Elagabalus was then entitled in Latin sacerdos amplissimus dei invicti Soli Elagabali pontifex maximus lit.highest priest of the unconquered god the Sun Elgabal supreme pontiff.46 That a foreign god should be honored above Jupiter with Elagabalus himself as chief priest shocked many Romans.68 As a token of respect for Roman religion however Elagabalus joined either Astarte Minerva Urania or some combination of the three to Elagabal as consort.69 A union between Elagabal and a traditional goddess would have served to strengthen ties between the new religion and the imperial cult. There may have been an effort to introduce Elagabal Urania and Athena as the new Capitoline Triad of Romereplacing Jupiter Juno and Minerva.70 He aroused further discontent when he married the Vestal Virgin Aquilia Severa Vestas high priestess claiming the marriage would produce godlike children.71 This was a flagrant breach of Roman law and tradition which held that any Vestal found to have engaged in sexual intercourse was to be buried alive.72 A lavish temple called the Elagabalium was built on the east face of the Palatine Hill to house Elagabal73 who was represented by a black conical meteorite from Emesa.45 This was a baetylus. Herodian wrote this stone is worshipped as though it were sent from heaven on it there are some small projecting pieces and markings that are pointed out which the people would like to believe are a rough picture of the sun because this is how they see them.74 Dio writes that in order to increase his piety as high priest of Elagabal atop a new Roman pantheon Elagabalus had himself circumcised and swore to abstain from swine.73 He forced senators to watch while he danced circling the altar of Elagabal to the accompaniment of drums and cymbals.74 Each summer solstice he held a festival dedicated to the god which became popular with the masses because of the free food distributed on these occasions.75 During this festival Elagabalus placed the black stone on a chariot adorned with gold and jewels which he paraded through the city76 A six horse chariot carried the divinity the horses huge and flawlessly white with expensive gold fittings and rich ornaments. No one held the reins and no one rode in the chariot the vehicle was escorted as if the god himself were the charioteer. Elagabalus ran backward in front of the chariot facing the god and holding the horses reins. He made the whole journey in this reverse fashion looking up into the face of his god.77 The most sacred relics from the Roman religion were transferred from their respective shrines to the Elagabalium including the emblem of the Great Mother the fire of Vesta the Shields of the Salii and the Palladium so that no other god could be worshipped except in association with Elagabal.78 Although his native cult was widely ridiculed by contemporaries sunworship was popular among the soldiers and would be promoted by several later emperors.79 Marriages sexual orientation and gender identity Roman denarius depicting Aquilia Severa the second wife of Elagabalus. The marriage caused a public outrage because Aquilia was a Vestal Virgin sworn by Roman law to celibacy for 30 years. Inscription iulia aquilia severa aug The question of Elagabaluss sexual orientation and gender identity is confused owing to salacious and unreliable sources. Cassius Dio states that Elagabalus was married five times twice to the same woman.54 His first wife was Julia Cornelia Paula whom he married prior to 29 August 219 between then and 28 August 220 he divorced Paula took the Vestal Virgin Julia Aquilia Severa as his second wife divorced her5480 and took a third wife who Herodian says was Annia Aurelia Faustina a descendant of Marcus Aurelius and the widow of a man Elagabalus had recently executed Pomponius Bassus.54 In the last year of his reign Elagabalus divorced Annia Faustina and remarried Aquilia Severa.54 Dio states that another husband of this woman Elagabalus was Hierocles an exslave and chariot driver from Caria.681 The Augustan History claims that Elagabalus also married a man named Zoticus an athlete from Smyrna while Dio says only that Zoticus was his cubicularius.682 Dio says that Elagabalus prostituted himself in taverns and brothels.7 Some writers suggest that Elagabalus may have identified as female or been transgender and may have sought sex reassignment surgery.8384858687 Dio says Elagabalus delighted in being called Hierocless mistress wife and queen.85 The emperor reportedly wore makeup and wigs preferred to be called a lady and not a lord and supposedly offered vast sums to any physician who could provide him with a vagina by means of incision.8588 Some historians treat these accounts with caution as sources for Elagabalus life were often antagonistic towards him.89 In November 2023 the North Hertfordshire Museum in Hitchin United Kingdom announced that Elagabalus would be considered as transgender and hence referred to with female pronouns in its exhibits due to claims that the emperor had said call me not Lord for I am a Lady. The museum has one Elagabalus coin.9091 Fall from power Elagabalus stoked the animus of Roman elites and the Praetorian Guard through his perceptibly foreign conduct and his religious provocations.92 When Elagabaluss grandmother Julia Maesa perceived that popular support for the emperor was waning she decided that he and his mother who had encouraged his religious practices had to be replaced. As alternatives she turned to her other daughter Julia Avita Mamaea and her daughters son the fifteenyearold Severus Alexander.93 Prevailing on Elagabalus she arranged that he appoint his cousin Alexander as his heir and that the boy be given the title of caesar.93 Alexander was elevated to caesar in June 221 possibly on 26 June.46 Elagabalus and Alexander were each named consul designatus for the following year probably on 1 July.46 Elagabalus took up his fourth consulship for the year of 2
22.4 6 Alexander shared the consulship with the emperor that year.93 However Elagabalus reconsidered this arrangement when he began to suspect that the Praetorian Guard preferred his cousin to himself.94 Elagabalus ordered various attempts on Alexanders life95 after failing to obtain approval from the Senate for stripping Alexander of his shared title.96 According to Dio Elagabalus invented the rumor that Alexander was near death in order to see how the Praetorians would react.97 A riot ensued and the Guard demanded to see Elagabalus and Alexander in the Praetorian camp.97 Assassination Statue of Elagabalus as Hercules refaced as his successor Alexander Severus National Archaeological Museum Naples The emperor complied and on 11 or 12 March 22298 he publicly presented his cousin along with his own mother Julia Soaemias. On their arrival the soldiers started cheering Alexander while ignoring Elagabalus who ordered the summary arrest and execution of anyone who had taken part in this display of insubordination.99 In response members of the Praetorian Guard attacked Elagabalus and his mother He made an attempt to flee and would have got away somewhere by being placed in a chest had he not been discovered and slain at the age of eighteen. His mother who embraced him and clung tightly to him perished with him their heads were cut off and their bodies after being stripped naked were first dragged all over the city and then the mothers body was cast aside somewhere or other while his was thrown into the Tiber.100 Following his assassination many associates of Elagabalus were killed or deposed. His lover Hierocles was executed.97 His religious edicts were reversed and the stone of Elagabal was sent back to Emesa.101 Women were again barred from attending meetings of the Senate.102 The practice of damnatio memoriaeerasing from the public record a disgraced personage formerly of notewas systematically applied in his case.46103 Several images including an overlifesize statue of him as Hercules now in Naples were recarved with the face of Alexander Severus.104 Sources Cassius Dio An Aureus of Elagabalus marked impcaes maur antoninus aug The historian Cassius Dio who lived from the second half of the second century until sometime after 229 wrote a contemporary account of Elagabalus. Born into a patrician family Dio spent the greater part of his life in public service. He was a senator under emperor Commodus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Septimius Severus and then he served as suffect consul around 205 and as proconsul in Africa and Pannonia.105 Dios Roman History spans nearly a millennium from the arrival of Aeneas in Italy until the year 229. His contemporaneous account of Elagabaluss reign is generally considered more reliable than the Augustan History or other accounts for this general time period106107 though by his own admission Dio spent the greater part of the relevant period outside of Rome and had to rely on secondhand information.105 Furthermore the political climate in the aftermath of Elagabaluss reign as well as Dios own position within the government of Severus Alexander who held him in high esteem and made him consul again likely influenced the truth of this part of his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake108 but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.109 Historian Clare Rowan calls Dios account a mixture of reliable information and literary exaggeration noting that Elagabaluss marriages and time as consul are confirmed by numismatic and epigraphic records.110 In other instances Dios account is inaccurate such as when he says Elagabalus appointed entirely unqualified officials and that Comazon had no military experience before being named to head the Praetorian Guard111 when in fact Comazon had commanded the Third Legion.4950 Dio also gives different accounts in different places of when and by whom Diadumenian whose forces Elagabalus fought was given imperial names and titles.112 Herodian Reverse of an aureus of Elagabalus marked fides exercitus the Faith of the Army Another contemporary of Elagabalus was Herodian a minor Roman civil servant who lived from c.170 until 240. His work History of the Roman Empire since Marcus Aurelius commonly abbreviated as Roman History is an eyewitness account of the reign of Commodus until the beginning of the reign of Gordian III. His work largely overlaps with Dios own Roman History and the texts written independently of each other agree more often than not about Elagabalus and his short but eventful reign.113 Arrizabalaga writes that Herodian is in most ways less detailed and punctilious than Dio114 and he is deemed less reliable by many modern scholars though Rowan considers his account of Elagabaluss reign more reliable than Dios110 and Herodians lack of literary and scholarly pretensions are considered to make him less biased than senatorial historians.115 He is considered an important source for the religious reforms which took place during the reign of Elagabalus116 which have been confirmed by numismatic117118 and archaeological evidence.119 Augustan History The source of many stories of Elagabaluss depravity is the Historia Augusta which includes controversial claims.120 It is most likely that the Historia Augusta was written towards the end of the fourth century during the reign of emperor Theodosius I.121 The account of Elagabalus in the Historia Augusta is of uncertain historical merit.122 Sections 13 to 17 relating to the fall of Elagabalus are less controversial among historians.123 The author of the most scandalous stories in the Historia Augusta concedes that both these matters and some others which pass belief were I think invented by people who wanted to depreciate Heliogabalus to win favour with Alexander.11 Modern historians Aureus of Elagabalus inscribed impc maur antoninus pf aug For readers of the modern age The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon 17371794 further cemented the scandalous reputation of Elagabalus. Gibbon not only accepted and expressed outrage at the allegations of the ancient historians but he might have added some details of his own for example he is the first historian known to claim that Gannys was a eunuch.124 Gibbon wrote To confound the order of the season and climate to sport with the passions and prejudices of his subjects and to subvert every law of nature and decency were in the number of his most delicious amusements. A long train of concubines and a rapid succession of wives among whom was a vestal virgin ravished by force from her sacred asylum were insufficient to satisfy the impotence of his passions. The master of the Roman world affected to copy the manners and dress of the female sex preferring the distaff to the sceptre and dishonored the principal dignities of the empire by distributing them among his numerous lovers one of whom was publicly invested with the title and authority of the emperors or as he more properly styled himself the empresss husband. It may seem probable the vices and follies of Elagabalus have been adorned by fancy and blackened by prejudice. Yet confining ourselves to the public scenes displayed before the Roman people and attested by grave and contemporary historians their inexpressible infamy surpasses that of any other age or country.125 The 
20 thcentury anthropologist James George Frazer author of The Golden Bough took seriously the monotheistic aspirations of the emperor but also ridiculed him The dainty priest of the Sun was the most abandoned reprobate who ever sat upon a throne ... It was the intention of this eminently religious but crackbrained despot to supersede the worship of all the gods not only at Rome but throughout the world by the single worship of Elagabalus or the Sun.126 The first booklength biography was The Amazing Emperor Heliogabalus127 1911 by J. Stuart Hay a serious and systematic study128 more sympathetic than that of previous historians which nonetheless stressed the exoticism of Elagabalus calling his reign one of enormous wealth and excessive prodigality luxury and aestheticism carried to their ultimate extreme and sensuality in all the refinements of its Eastern habit.129 Medal of Elagabalus Louvre Museum. Inscription imp antoninus pius aug Some recent historians paint a more favourable picture of the emperors rule. Martijn Icks in Images of Elagabalus 2008 republished as The Crimes of Elagabalus in 2011 and 2012 doubts the reliability of the ancient sources and argues that it was the emperors unorthodox religious policies that alienated the power elite of Rome to the point that his grandmother saw fit to eliminate him and replace him with his cousin. He described ancient stories pertaining to the emperor as part of a long tradition of character assassination in ancient historiography and biography.130 Leonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado in The Emperor Elagabalus Fact or Fiction 2008 is also critical of the ancient historians and speculates that neither religion nor sexuality played a role in the fall of the young emperor. Prado instead suggests Elagabalus was the loser in a power struggle within the imperial family that the loyalty of the Praetorian Guards was up for sale and that Julia Maesa had the resources to outmaneuver and outbribe her grandson. In this version of events once Elagabalus his mother and his immediate circle had been murdered a campaign of character assassination began resulting in a grotesque caricature that has persisted to the present day.131 Other historians including Icks criticized Prado for being overly skeptical of primary sources.132 Warwick Ball in his book Rome in the East writes an apologetic account of the emperor arguing that descriptions of his religious rites were exaggerated and should be dismissed as propaganda similar to how pagan descriptions of Christian rites have since been dismissed. Ball describes the emperors ritual processions as sound political and religious policy arguing that syncretism of eastern and western deities deserves praise rather than ridicule. Ultimately he paints Elagabalus as a child forced to become emperor who as expected of the highpriest of a cult continued his rituals even after becoming emperor. Ball justified Elagabaluss executions of prominent Roman figures who criticized his religious activities in the same way. Finally Ball asserts Elagabaluss eventual victory in the sense that his deity would be welcomed by Rome in its Sol Invictus form 50 years later. Ball claims that Sol Invictus came to influence the monotheist Christian beliefs of Constantine asserting that this influence remains in Christianity to this day.133 Cultural references Despite the attempted damnatio memoriae stories about Elagabalus survived and figured in many works of art and literature.134 In Spanish his name became a word for glutton heliogbalo.134135 Due to the ancient stories about him he often appears in literature and other creative media as a decadent figure becoming something of an antihero in the Decadent movement of the late 
19 th century and inspiring many famous works of art especially by Decadents86 and the epitome of a young amoral aesthete.

Explanatory notes  The first known instance is in the Chronograph of 354 in the list of emperors in the section titled Chronica Urbis Romae where he is called Antoninus Elagaballus.4  Herodian who lived during Elagabalus reign writes that he and Alexander were about fourteen and ten respectively in May 2
18.1 2 The Epitome de Caesaribus written over a century later states that he lived sixteen years while Alexander died in his twentysixth year.13 Only the latter figure coincides with Herodian and it is unclear if they are using regular or inclusive counting.
