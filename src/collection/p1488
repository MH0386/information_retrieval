20 th Dynasty or Dynasty 20 is the third and last dynasty of the Ancient Egyptian New Kingdom period lasting from 1189 BC to 1077 BC. The 
19 th and 
20 th Dynasties together constitute an era known as the Ramesside period. This dynasty is generally considered to mark the beginning of the decline of Ancient Egypt at the transition from the Late Bronze to Iron Age. During the period of the Twentieth Dynasty Ancient Egypt faced the crisis of invasions by Sea Peoples. The dynasty successfully defended Egypt while sustaining heavy damage. Historyedit After the death of the last pharaoh of the 
19 th Dynasty Queen Twosret Egypt entered into a period of civil war. Because of lost historical records the cause of the civil war is unknown. The war was ended with the accession to the throne by Setnakhte who founded the 
20 th Dynasty of Egypt. From the reign of Setnakhte and his son Ramesses III Egypt faced the crisis caused by the invading of the Sea Peoples. These invasions formed part of a series of linked crises in numerous Mediterranean civilizations. Together these crises are often referred to as the Late Bronze Age collapse. The Sea Peoples caused considerable damage to the people of Egypt visible in the historical record. One inscription reads All at once the lands were removed and scattered in the fray. No land could resist their arms from Hatti Kode Carchemish Arzawa and Alashiya on  being cut off at one time. A camp was set up in Amurru. They desolated its people and its land was like that which had never existed. They were coming forward toward Egypt while the flame was prepared for them. Inscription from the second pylon of the temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu1 Not only Egypt was affected by the Sea People invasions. The empire of the Hittites a longstanding rival to Egypt collapsed never to rise again. In the inscription quoted above the Hittites are called Hatti. With the victory in the Battle of Djahy and the Battle of the Delta during Year 8 of Ramesses IIIs reign Egypt successfully repelled the invading Sea Peoples protecting Egypt from ruin like other Bronze Age civilizations. During the Twentieth Dynasty many of the temples were built to display the power of Egypt. However they also indicate the political ascendancy of the priesthood over the pharaoh. The Twentieth Dynasty declined because of drastic climate change infighting in the royal family and growing power of the priesthood and nobility. Following the death of Ramesses XI the last pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty a period of chaos ensued. This was ended by Smendes a member of the Egyptian nobility who became the first Pharaoh of the 
21 st Dynasty. Backgroundedit Main article End of the 
19 th Dynasty Upon the death of the last pharaoh of the 
19 th Dynasty Queen Twosret Egypt descended into a period of civil war as attested by the Elephantine stela built by Setnakhte. The circumstances of Twosrets demise are uncertain as she may have died peacefully during her reign or been overthrown by Setnakhte who was likely already middle aged at the time.2 
20 th Dynastyedit A consistent theme of this dynasty was the loss of pharaonic power to the High Priests of Amun. Horemheb a pharaoh of the 
18 th Dynasty had restored the traditional Ancient Egyptian religion and the priesthood of Amun after their abandonment by Akhenaten. With the High Priests now acting as intermediaries between the gods and the people rather than the pharaoh the position of pharaoh no longer commanded the same kind of power as it had in the past.3 Setnakhteedit Main article Setnakhte Setnakhte stabilized the situation in Egypt and may have driven off an attempted invasion by the Sea Peoples. He ruled for about 34 years before being succeeded by his son Ramesses III. Ramesses IIIedit Main article Ramesses III In Year 5 of his reign Ramesses defeated a Libyan invasion of Egypt by the Libu Meshwesh and Seped people through Marmarica who had previously unsuccessfully invaded during the reign of Merneptah.4 Ramesses III is most famous for decisively defeating a confederacy of the Sea Peoples including the Denyen Tjekker Peleset Shardana and Weshesh in the Battle of Djahy and the Battle of the Delta during Year 8 of his reign. Within the Papyrus Harris I which attests these events in detail Ramesses is said to have settled the defeated Sea Peoples in strongholds most likely located in Canaan as his subjects.35 In Year 11 of Ramesses reign another coalition of Libyan invaders was defeated in Egypt. Between regnal Year 12 and Year 29 a systematic program of reorganization of the varied cults of the Ancient Egyptian religion was undertaken by creating and funding new cults and restoring temples. In Year 29 of Ramesses reign the first recorded labor strike in human history took place after food rations for the favored and elite royal tomb builders and artisans in the village of Set Maat now known as Deir elMedina could not be provisioned.6 The reign of Ramesses III is also known for a harem conspiracy in which Queen Tiye one of his lesser wives was implicated in an assassination attempt against the king with the goal of putting her son Pentawer on the throne. The coup was unsuccessful. The king died from the attempt on his life however it was his legitimate heir and son Ramesses IV who succeeded him to the throne who thereafter arrested and put approximately 30 conspirators to death.78 Ramesses IVedit Main article Ramesses IV At the start of his reign Ramesses IV started an enormous building program on the scale of Ramesses the Greats own projects. He doubled the number of work gangs at Set Maat to a total of 120 men and dispatched numerous expeditions to the stone quarries of Wadi Hammamat and the turquoise mines of the Sinai. One of the largest expeditions included 8368 men of which some 2000 were soldiers.9 Ramesses expanded his fathers Temple of Khonsu at Karnak and possibly began his own mortuary temple at a site near the Temple of Hatshepsut. Another smaller temple is associated with Ramesses north of Medinet Habu. Ramesses IV saw issues with the provision of food rations to his workmen similar to the situation under his father. Ramessesnakht the High Priest of Amun at the time began to accompany state officials as they went to pay the workmen their rations suggesting that at least in part it was the Temple of Amun and not the Egyptian state that was responsible for their wages.citation needed He also produced the Papyrus Harris I the longest known papyrus from Ancient Egypt measuring in at 41 meters long with 1500 lines of text to celebrate the achievements of his father. Ramesses Vedit Main article Ramesses V Ramesses V reigned for no more than 4 years dying of smallpox in 1143 BC. The Turin Papyrus Cat. 2044 attests that during his reign the workmen of Set Maat were forced to periodically stop working on Ramesses KV9 tomb out of fear of the enemy suggesting increasing instability in Egypt and an inability to defend the country from what are presumed to be Libyan raiding parties.10 The Wilbour Papyrus is thought to date from Ramesses Vs reign. The document reveals that most of the land in Egypt by that point was controlled by the Temple of Amun and that the Temple had complete control over Egypts finances.11 Ramesses VIedit Main article Ramesses VI Ramesses VI is best known for his tomb which when built inadvertently buried the tomb of pharaoh Tutankhamun underneath keeping it safe from grave robbing until its discovery by Howard Carter in 1922. Ramesses VIIedit Main article Ramesses VII Ramesses VIIs only monument is his tomb KV1.citation needed Ramesses VIIIedit Main article Ramesses VIII Almost nothing is known about Ramesses VIIIs reign which lasted for a single year. He is only attested at Medinet Habu and through a few plaques. The only monument from his reign is his modest tomb which was used for Mentuherkhepeshef son of Ramesses IX rather than Ramesses VIII himself.citation needed Ramesses IXedit Main article Ramesses IX During Year 16 and Year 17 of Ramesses IXs reign famous tomb robbery trials took place as attested by the Abbott Papyrus. A careful examination by a vizierial commission was undertaken of ten royal tombs four tombs of the Chantresses of the Estate of the Divine Adoratrix and finally the tombs of the citizens of Thebes. Many of these were found to have been broken into like the tomb of Pharaoh Sobekemsaf II whose mummy had been stolen.12 Ramesses IXs cartouche has been found at Gezer in Canaan suggesting that Egypt at this time still had some degree of influence in the region.13 Most of the building projects during Ramesses IXs reign were at Heliopolis.14 Ramesses Xedit Main article Ramesses X Ramesses Xs reign is poorly documented. The Necropolis Journal of Set Maat records the general idleness of the workmen at this time due at least in part to the danger of Libyan raiders.15 Ramesses XIedit Main article Ramesses XI Ramesses XI was the last pharaoh of the 
20 th Dynasty. During his reign the position grew so weak that in the south the High Priests of Amun at Thebes became the de facto rulers of Upper Egypt while Smendes controlled Lower Egypt even before Ramesses XIs death. Smendes would eventually found the TwentyFirst dynasty at Tanis.16 Declineedit As happened under the earlier Nineteenth Dynasty this dynasty struggled under the effects of the bickering between the heirs of Ramesses III. For instance three different sons of Ramesses III are known to have assumed power as Ramesses IV Ramesses VI and Ramesses VIII respectively. However at this time Egypt was also increasingly beset by a series of droughts belownormal flooding levels of the Nile famine civil unrest and official corruption  all of which would limit the managerial abilities of any king. Sea Peoples in Egyptedit Main article Sea Peoples The late 
13 th century BC was a time of uncertainty and conflict for peoples and polities of the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean due to the invasion by Sea Peoples which caused the Late Bronze Age collapse.1718 While there is not much information left to show us why the Sea Peoples began the large scale invasion the written evidence shows the weakening of central administrations erosion of political powers and food shortage might be the reasons.19 From Ramses IIIs mortuary temple at Medinet Habou depicting a chaotic scene of boats and warriors entwined in battle in the Nile delta it showing that Sea Peoples were seaborne foes from different origins.20 They launched a combined landsea invasion that destabilized the already weakened power base of empires and kingdoms of the old world and attempted to enter or control the Egyptian territory.17 While with the victory in the Battle of Djahy and the Battle of the Delta during Year 8 of Ramesses IIIs reign Egypt successfully repeal the invading forces of Sea Peoples the damage that cost the collapse of Eastern Mediterranean world largely damage the trade route of Egypt due to most of their trading partner had been destroy by Sea Peoples. Sea Invading from Sea Peoples Pharaohs of the 
20 th Dynastyedit Main article List of pharaohs The pharaohs of the 
20 th Dynasty ruled for approximately 120 years from c. 1187 to 1064 BC. The dates and names in the table are mostly taken from Chronological Table for the Dynastic Period in Erik Hornung Rolf Krauss  David Warburton editors Ancient Egyptian Chronology Handbook of Oriental Studies Brill 2006. Many of the pharaohs were buried in the Valley of the Kings in Thebes designated KV.

The familial relationships are unclear especially towards the end of the dynasty.

During his reign he fought off the invasions of the Sea Peoples in Egypt and tolerated their settlement in Canaan. A conspiracy was hatched to kill him but it failed. He was later murdered. His mummy long an inspiration for the scary Hollywood films showed his throat was slit. Ramesses IV was the fifth son of Ramesses III. He assumed the throne after his four older brothers had died. Ramesses V was the son of Ramesses IV and Queen Duatentopet. During his reign Libyan raiders attacked the country and attempted to conquer Thebes forcing the workers of Deir elMedina to halt work in the Valley of the Kings. He died of smallpox. Ramesses VI was an uncle of Ramesses V. He usurped his predecessors throne and later his tomb KV9. Ramesses VII was the son of Ramesses VI. During his reign prices of grain soared to the highest levels. His mummy has never been found but cups bearing his name were found in the royal cache at Deir elBahri. He was buried in KV1. Ramesses VIII born Sethherkhepeshef was a brother of Ramesses VI and a surviving son of Ramesses III. He may have ruled for a year or two. His tomb has never been identified. Ramesses IX was the grandson of Ramesses III nephew of Ramesses IV and VI and a son of Mentuherkhepeshef who never became a pharaoh. Ramesses X born Amunherkhepeshef took the throne after Ramesses IX. He is a poorly documented king with few monuments to his name. His tomb KV18 was left unfinished. Ramesses XI was the last pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty. As Egypt weakened Ramesses XI was forced to share power in a triumvirate with Herihor the high priest of Amun and Smendes governor of Lower Egypt. Ramesses XI was buried in Lower Egypt by Smendes who later took the throne himself.
