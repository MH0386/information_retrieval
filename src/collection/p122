Khasekhemwy Reunified Egypt after a period of troubles ca. 2690 BC 1718 years Old Kingdom The Old Kingdom is the period in the third millennium BC when Egypt attained its first continuous peak of civilisational complexity and achievement the first of three socalled Kingdom periods which mark the high points of civilization in the Nile Valley spanning the period when Egypt was ruled by the Third Dynasty through the Sixth Dynasty 26862181 BC Many Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth Dynasties in the Old Kingdom as a continuation of the administration centralised at Memphis The Old Kingdom was followed by a period of disunity and relative cultural decline referred to by Egyptologists as the First Intermediate Periodor as the Egyptians called it the first illness. The royal capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom was located at Memphis where Djoser established his court. The Old Kingdom is perhaps best known however for the large number of pyramids which were constructed at this time as pharaonic burial places. For this reason the Old Kingdom is frequently referred to as the Age of the Pyramids Third Dynasty The Third Dynasty ruled from 2686 to 2613 BC. Name Image Comments Dates Djoser Commissioned the first Pyramid in Egypt The Step Pyramid Constructed by Djosers chief architect and scribe Imhotep 19 or 28 years ca. 2670 BC Radiocarbon dates start reign between 2691 and 2625 Sekhemkhet Imhotep participated in the construction of his unfinished step pyramid 26492643 Sanakhte Could be the same as Nebka c. 2650 Khaba Built an unfinished step pyramid 26432637 Huni Could be the same as Qahedjet may have started the Meidum pyramid 26372613 Fourth Dynasty The Fourth Dynasty ruled from 2613 to 2498 BC and included the pharaohs who had the Great Pyramids built Khufu Cheops Khafra Chephren and  Mycerinus Name Image Comments Dates  Built the Meidum Pyramid and the   341 ft1

He also built the first true pyramid the   Some say that he was buried in the Red Pyramid while others say that he was buried in the Bent Pyramid. Bones have been found at the Red Pyramid but there is no evidence that this is Sneferus body. 26132589 BC Khufu Greek form Cheops Built the great pyramid of Giza Note that Khufu is spoken of in early sources as being third of his family to rule although there is no known record of a Pharaoh between Sneferu and Khufu. One supposition is that there might have been a very short reign of some elder brother of Khufu whose inscriptions names and monuments have perished for one reason or another. 25892566 BC  Radjedef Believed to have created the Great Sphinx of Giza as a monument for his deceased father. He also created a pyramid at Abu Rawash. However this pyramid is no longer intact as it is believed the Romans recycled the materials it was made from. Before being demolished by the Romans according to a documentary aired by the History Channel the pyramid may actually have been the highest ever built about 20 meters taller than the Great Pyramid of Giza although this is due to its elevated location rather than the size from base to tip 25662558 BC Khafre Greek form Chephren His pyramid is the second largest in Giza. Credited by some Egyptologists as the builder of the Great Sphinx of Giza 25582532 BC   Here some authorities insert Bikheris following Manetho   Greek form Mycerinus His pyramid is the third and smallest in Giza. 25322503 BC Shepseskaf Broke with the tradition of pyramid building and instead had the Mastabat elFaraun made for himself 25032498 BC Djedefptah  Here some authorities insert Djedefptah a.k.a.

8 th Dynasties. Short reign c. 2184 BC  2181 BC First Intermediate Period The First Intermediate Period 21812060 BC is the period between the end of the Old Kingdom and the advent of the Middle Kingdom The Old Kingdom rapidly collapsed after the death of Pepi II He had reigned for 94 years longer than any monarch in history and died aged 100. The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age. The Union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine Around 2160 BC a new line of pharaohs tried to reunite   from their capital in Herakleopolis Magna In the meantime a rival line based at Thebes was reuniting   and a clash between the two rival dynasties was inevitable. Around 2055 BC Mentuhotep II the son and successor of pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands thereby starting the Middle Kingdom. Seventh and Eighth Dynasties combined The Seventh and Eighth Dynasties ruled from c. 2181 to c. 2160 BC. They comprise numerous ephemeral rulers reigning from Memphis over a possibly divided Egypt.

The Middle Kingdom can be noted for the expansion of trade outside of the kingdom that occurred during this time. This opening of trade eventually led to the downfall of the Middle Kingdom induced by an invasion from the Hyksos Eleventh Dynasty continued The second part of the Eleventh Dynasty is considered to be part of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. Name Image Comments Dates Nebhetepre Mentuhotep II Gained all Egypt ca. 2015 BC Middle Kingdom begins. 20602010 BC Sankhkare Mentuhotep III Commanded the first expedition to Punt of the Middle Kingdom 20101998 BC Nebtawyre Mentuhotep IV Obscure pharaoh absent from later king lists tomb unknown.

The Thirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the Twelfth Dynasty and was unable to hold onto the two lands of Egypt. Either at the start of the dynasty c. 1805 BC or toward the middle of it in c. 1710 BC the provincial ruling family in Xois located in the marshes of the eastern Delta broke away from the central authority to form the Canaanite Fourteenth Dynasty The Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of Sobekhotep IV and around 1720 BC took control of the town of Avaris the modern Tell elDabaKhatana conquering the kingdom of the 
14 th dynasty. Then some time around 1650 BC the Hyksos perhaps led by Salitis the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty conquered Memphis thereby terminating the 
13 th dynasty. The power vacuum in Upper Egypt resulting from the collapse of the 
13 th dynasty allowed the 
16 th dynasty to declare its independence in Thebes only to be overrun by the Hyksos kings shortly thereafter. Subsequently as the Hyksos withdrew from Upper Egypt the native Egyptian ruling house in Thebes set itself up as the Seventeenth Dynasty This dynasty eventually drove the Hyksos back into Asia under Seqenenre Tao Kamose and finally Ahmose first pharaoh of the New Kingdom. Thirteenth Dynasty The Thirteenth Dynasty following the Turin King List ruled from 1802 to around 1649 BC and lasted 153 or 154 years according to Manetho.
