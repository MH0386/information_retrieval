The Abydos Dynasty would have been contemporaneous with the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Dynasties from approximately 1650 to 1600 BC.1 It would have been based in or around Abydos and its royal necropolis might have been located at the foot of the Mountain of Anubis a hill resembling a pyramid in the Abydene desert close to a rockcut tomb built for pharaoh Senusret III. Debate over existenceedit Evidence in favoredit The cartouche of pharaoh Woseribre Senebkay inside the kings burial tomb. The existence of an Abydos Dynasty was first proposed by Detlef Franke2 and later elaborated on by Kim Ryholt in 1997. Ryholt observes that two attested kings of this period Wepwawetemsaf Wepwawet is his protection and Pantjeny He of Thinis bore names in connection with Abydos Wepwawet being an important Abydene god and Thinis being a prominent city located a few miles north of Abydos. Additionally Wepwawetemsaf Pantjeny and Snaaib another king of the period are each known from single stelae discovered in Abydos which could be a sign that this was their seat of power.3 Finally Ryholt argues that the existence of an Abydos Dynasty would explain 16 entries of the Turin canon at the end of the 
16 th Dynasty. The Abydos Dynasty may have come into existence in the time lapse between the fall of the 
13 th Dynasty with the conquest of Memphis by the Hyksos and the southward progression of the Hyksos to Thebes.3 The existence of the dynasty may have been vindicated in January 2014 when the tomb of the previously unknown pharaoh Senebkay was discovered in the southern part of Abydos an area called Anubis Mountain in ancient times. If Senebkay indeed belongs to the Abydos Dynasty his tomb might signal the royal necropolis of this dynasty adjacent to the tombs of the Middle Kingdom rulers.1 Since then excavations have revealed no less than eight anonymous royal tombs dating to the Second Intermediate Period similar in style and size to Senebkays burial as well as two tombs possibly pyramids dating to the mid 
13 thDynasty S9 and S10 which may belong to Neferhotep I and his brother Sobekhotep IV.4 Evidence againstedit The existence of an Abydos Dynasty is not agreed by all scholars. For example Marcel Mare observes that a workshop operating from Abydos and producing stelae for two kings associated with the Abydos Dynasty Pantjeny and Wepwawetemsaf also likely produced the stela of Rahotep of the 
17 th Dynasty. Thus if the Abydos Dynasty did exist this workshop would have been producing stelae for two enemy dynasties something which he judges to be rather unlikely.5 It remains unclear however whether these two dynasties coexisted at any one time for instance in Ryholts reconstruction of the Second Intermediate Period they are separated by c. 20 years.3 Countering the argument in favor of the Abydos Dynasty based on the tomb of Senebkay Alexander IlinTomich argues that certain Middle Kingdom pharaohs such as Senusret III and Sobekhotep IV also have their tombs at Abydos yet nobody places these kings into an Abydosbased dynasty. At the opposite he wonders whether Senebkay might be a king of the Theban 
16 th Dynasty.6 Territoryedit In red the possible extent of power of the Abydos Dynasty If the Abydos Dynasty was indeed a dynasty the seat of its power would probably have been either Abydos or Thinis. A possible graffito of Wepwawetemsaf was discovered by Karl Richard Lepsius in the tomb BH2 of the 
12 th Dynasty nomarch Amenemhat at Beni Hasan about 250 km North of Abydos in Middle Egypt. If the attribution of this graffito is correct and if Wepwawetemsaf did belong to the Abydos Dynasty then its territory might have extended that far north.3 Since the dynasty was contemporaneous with the 
16 th Dynasty the territory under Abydene control could not have extended farther than Hu 50 km south of Abydos.3 Rulersedit The following 16 entries of the Turin canon are attributed to the Abydos Dynasty by Kim Ryholt3 Pharaohs of the Abydos Dynasty Prenomen of the King Entry of the Turin canon Transliteration Woser...re Col 11.
