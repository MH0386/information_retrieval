He had reigned for more than 64 and likely up to 94 years longer than any monarch in history. The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age. The union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine.The kings of the 
7 th and 
8 th Dynasties who represented the successors of the 
6 th Dynasty tried to hold onto some power in Memphis but owed much of it to powerful nomarchs. After 20 to 45 years they were overthrown by a new line of pharaohs based in Herakleopolis Magna. Some time after these events a rival line based at Thebes EgyptThebes revolted against their nominal Northern overlords and united Upper Egypt. Around 2055 BC Mentuhotep II the son and successor of pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands thereby starting the Middle Kingdom.Seventh and Eighth DynastiesMainSeventh Dynasty of EgyptEighth Dynasty of EgyptThe Seventh Dynasty of EgyptSeventh and Eighth Dynasties ruled for approximately 2045 years. They comprise numerous ephemeral kings reigning from Memphis EgyptMemphis over a possibly divided Egypt and in any case holding only limited power owing to the effectively feudal system into which the administration had evolved.The list below is based on the Abydos King List dating to the reign of Seti I and taken from Jrgen von Beckeraths Handbuch der gyptischen Knigsnamenref namebeckJrgen von Beckerath Handbuch der gyptischen Knigsnamen Mnchner gyptologische Studien Heft 49 Mainz  P. von Zabern 1999 ISBN3805325916 httpwww.mediafire.comview
