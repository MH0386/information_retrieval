25 th century BC. Shepseskafs relation to his predecessor Menkaure is not entirely certain he might have been his son or possibly his brother. The identity of his mother is highly uncertain as she could have been one of Menkaures consorts or queen Khentkaus I or Neferhetepes. Similarly Shepseskafs relation to his probable successor on the throne Userkaf is not known although in the absence of clear indication of strife at the transition between the fourth and fifth dynasties Userkaf could well have been his son or his brother. If Shepseskaf was succeeded directly by Userkaf rather than by Thampthis as claimed by some historical sources then his death marks the end of the fourth dynasty. The transition to the fifth dynasty seems not to have been a sharp rupture but rather a continuous process of evolution in the kings power and role within the Egyptian state. Around this time some of the highest positions of power such as that of vizier which had hitherto been the prerogative of the royal family were opened to nobles of nonroyal extraction. The only activities firmly datable to Shepseskafs short reign are the completion of the hitherto unfinished mortuary complex of the Pyramid of Menkaure using mudbricks and the construction of his own tomb at South Saqqara now known as the Mastabat alFiraun. Shepseskafs decisions to abandon the Giza necropolis and to build a mastaba that is a flatroofed rectangular structure rather than a pyramid for himself are significant and continue to be debated. Some Egyptologists see these decisions as symptoms of a powerstruggle between the king and the priesthood of Ra while others believe purely practical considerations possibly including a declining economy are at fault. Alternatively it may be that Shepseskaf intended his tomb to be a pyramid but after his death it was completed as a mastaba. Possibly because of this and the small dimensions of his tomb compared to those of his forebears and his short reign Shepseskaf was the object of a relatively minor statesponsored funerary cult that disappeared in the second half of the fifth dynasty. This cult was revived in the later Middle Kingdom period as a privately run lucrative cult aimed at guaranteeing a royal intercessor for the offerings made to their dead by members of the lower strata of society. Familyedit Parentsedit See also Fourth Dynasty of Egypt family tree The relationship between Shepseskaf and his predecessor Menkaure is not entirely certain. The dominant view in modern Egyptology was first expounded by George Andrew Reisner who proposed that Shepseskaf was Menkaures son. Reisner based his hypothesis on a decree showing that Shepseskaf completed Menkaures mortuary temple. This hypothesis is shared by many Egyptologists including Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton30 Rainer Stadelmann31 and Peter Clayton.32 Peter Jnosi nonetheless remarks that the decree does not constitute irrefutable proof of filiation since it does not describe the relationship between these two kings explicitly.note 3 In particular the completion of the tomb of a deceased pharaoh by his successor does not necessarily depend on a direct fatherson relation between the two.3410 A possible alternative proposed by Miroslav Verner is that Menkaure and Shepseskaf could have been brothers35 and the latters consequently advanced age when ascending to the throne could explain his short reign.2 In contrast with these hypotheses Egyptologists Ludwig Borchardt and William C. Hayes posited that Shepseskaf could have been of nonroyal extraction and took the throne only thanks to his marriage to queen Khentkaus I.36 The identity of Shepseskafs mother is even more uncertain than that of his father. If the latter was Menkaure then Shepseskafs mother could have been one of Menkaures royal wives Khamerernebty II Rekhetre or a secondary wife.5 Alternatively Miroslav Brta believes that Khentkaus I may have been Shepseskafs mother24 and also the mother of his successor Userkaf.note 437 Indeed a close relationship between Shepseskaf and Khentkaus I has been inferred by Egyptologist Selim Hassan based on the immense conformity of their tombs an opinion that is widely shared38394041 yet what this relationship was remains unclear. Khentkaus I may instead have been the wife42 or the daughter of Shepseskaf.2 One more possibility was put forth by Arielle Kozloff who proposed instead that it was Neferhetepes a daughter of Djedefre who was Shepseskafs mother.43 For Egyptologist Vivienne Gae Callender there is no evidence in support of this hypothesis.44 Queens and childrenedit Portrait of Khentkaus I from her tomb Inscriptions in queen Bunefers Giza tombnote 545 demonstrate that she is related to Shepseskaf she notably bore the title of Great of praise priestess of King Shepseskaf the kings wife the great ornament the great favourite. Lana Troy an Egyptologist deduces from this title that while she married a pharaoh she served as a priestess in the funerary cult for her fathernote 6 and therefore must have been Shepseskafs daughter and the consort of another unspecified king.46 Indeed all priestesses serving in a kings funerary cult were princesses daughters or granddaughters of that king. If this hypothesis is true it makes Bunefer the only queen known from Ancient Egypt to have served in a mortuary cult.47 Exceptional circumstances could explain this observation for example if there was no other suitable female descendant to officiate in Shepseskafs cult after his death.48 Bunefers mother could have been Khentkaus I whose tomb is located near Bunefers so that Khentkaus I might have been a consort of Shepseskaf.48 Bunefers royal husband may have been pharaoh Thamphthis whose existence is uncertain however as he is not attested archaeologically see below for a discussion.48 Hassan who excavated Bunefers tomb rejects the opinion that Bunefer was Shepseskafs daughter. He notes that most of Bunefers titles are wifely ones and stresses the fact that the name of Shepseskaf appears in her tomb is in favour of the assumption that he was her husband.49 In any case Bunefer had at least one son whose name is lost and whose father was not a king according to this sons titles.50 He was possibly an issue from a second nonroyal marriage of Bunefer.5152 Princess Khamaat married to the high priest of Ptah Ptahshepses and is known by her titles to have been the daughter of a king. She was long thought to be a daughter of Shepseskaf53 following a hypothesis by 
19 thcentury Egyptologist Emmanuel de Roug.54 A consensus was reached on this issue48555657585960 but in 2002 Egyptologist Peter F. Dorman published inscriptions from Ptahshepsess tomb showing that she was Userkafs daughter instead.61 Finally Mark Lehner proposes that Shepseskaf fathered pharaoh Userkaf with queen Khentkaus I an idea shared by Kozloff6263 but rejected by Brta who thinks they were brothers.24 Alternatively Khentkaus I has been conjectured to be Shepseskafs daughter.2 Reignedit Shepseskafs reign is difficult to date precisely in absolute terms. An absolute chronology referring to dates in the modern Western calendar is estimated by Egyptologists working backwards by adding reign lengths  themselves uncertain and inferred from historical sources and archaeological evidence  and in a few cases using ancient astronomical observations and radiocarbon dates.27 These methodologies do not agree perfectly and some uncertainty remains. As a result Shepseskafs rule is dated to some time around the late 
26 th to mid
25 th century BC.note 126 Relative chronologyedit Statue head at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts believed to depict either Shepseskaf64 or Menkaure65 The relative chronological position of Shepseskaf within the fourth dynasty is not entirely certain. The near contemporarynote 7 fifth dynasty royal annals now known as the Palermo stone indicates unambiguouslynote 8 that he succeeded Menkaure on the throne and was crowned on the 
11 th day of the fourth month. The identity of his successor is less certain. Archaeological evidence seems to indicate that Shepseskaf was succeeded directly by Userkaf. In particular no intervening king is mentioned on the tombs of officials who served at the time. For example an inscription in the tomb of the palace courtier Netjerpunesut gives the following sequence of kings he served under Djedefre  Khafre  Menkaure  Shepseskaf  Userkaf  Sahure  Neferirkare.707172 Similarly in his Giza tomb prince Sekhemkare reports about his career under the kings Khafre Menkaura Shepseskaf Userkaf and Sahure7273 while the high priest74 Ptahshepses describes being born under Menkaure growing up under Shepseskaf and starting his career under Userkaf.75 Furthermore Egyptologist Patrick OMara underlines that no names of estates of the period which are compounded with royal names make mention of any other kings than these nor do the names of ... royal grandchildren who often bore the name of a royal ancestor as a component of their own name.70 This reconstruction of late fourth to early fifth dynasty is also in agreement with that given on the Abydos king list written during the reigns of Seti I c. 12921279 BC where Shepseskafs cartouche is on the 
25 th entry between those of Menkaure and Userkaf.7677 Three historical sources go directly or indirectly against this order of succession. The source in direct contradiction is the Aegyptiaca  a history of Egypt written in the 
3 rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II 283246 BC by Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. According to the Byzantine scholar George Syncellus Africanus wrote that the Aegyptiaca mentioned the succession Bicheris  Seberchers  Thamphthis at the end of the fourth dynasty while Userchers is given as the fifth dynastys first king. Seberchers in Greek  and Userchers are believed to be the Hellenised forms for Shepeseskaf and Userkaf respectively78 while the identities of Bicheris and Thampthis are unknown. They could refer to shadowy figures perhaps the fourth dynasty prince Baka in the case of Bicheris and Thampthis could originate from the Egyptian name Djedefptah or they could both be fictitious rulers.79 That a king might have reigned between Shepseskaf and Userkaf is also indirectly supported by the Turin canon a king list written during the 
19 th dynasty in the early Ramesside era 12921189 BC. The canon written on papyrus is damaged at several spots and thus many royal names are either fragmentary or completely lost in lacunae today. In column III line 15 King Shepseskaf is listed line 16 is wholly in a lacuna while the end of Userkafs name is legible on line 17. The missing line 16 must have originally held the royal name of Shepseskafs unknown successor.80 The Saqqara Tablet written under Ramses II c.13031213 BC also seems to have mentioned an unknown successor for Shepseskaf as it originally listed nine cartouches corresponding to fourth dynasty kings when only six are otherwise known from archaeological evidence Sneferu Khufu Djedefre Khafra Menkaure and Shepseskaf. The five cartouches between those of Khafre and Userkaf are now illegible.7681 For Egyptologist Nigel Strudwick the uncertainty regarding Shepseskafs successor and the presence of further shadowy rulers in historical sources during the late fourth dynasty point to some family instability at the time.82 Durationedit The duration of Shepseskafs rule is uncertain but it is generally taken to have lasted probably four83 but perhaps up to seven years. Explicit archaeological evidence on this matter is reduced to six documents. Four of these are inscriptions dated to the year of his accession to the throne three found in tombs of the Giza necropolis and one from the Palermo stone.84 The last two contemporary inscriptions mention his second regnal yearnote 9 one of which is found on the decree of Shepseskaf concerning Menkaures pyramid town.8889 Two historical sources report the duration of Shepseskafs reign. The Turin canon credits him with a reign of four years90 while Manethos Aegyptiaca gives him seven years on the throne.8491 Although this figure is compatible with the Palermo stone which may have had up to seven compartments relating Shepseskafs reign according to Georges Daressy92 this is considered an overestimate according to modern consensus. Verner points notably to the unfinished state of his mastaba to conclude Shepseskafs rule did not exceed the four years attributed to him by the Turin canon.note 1093 A reappraisal of the Palermo stone by Jrgen von Beckerath limits the space available on it for Shepseskafs rule to five or six compartments corresponding to that many years.94 Manethos count may be explained by a conflation of the four full years attributed to Shepseskaf by the Turin king list plus two full years and a significant monthly fraction credited to his anonymous successor on that list. This successor could correspond to Manethos Thampthis to whom Manetho gives nine years of reign although as observed by Verner archaeological evidence for this ruler is nil.7095 Activitiesedit Very few activities of Shepseskaf are known. The Palermo stonenote 7 reports that in the year of his accession to the throne he participated in the going around the Two Lands and a festival of the diadem during which two images of the god Wepwawet were fashioned and the gods who unite the two lands are said to have followed the king. These events occurred at or close to the coronation of the king.96 The site of Shepseskafs tomb said to be a pyramid was chosen that same year. On that occasion an enclosure of Lebanese wood may have been set up to surround the perimeter of the part of the Saqqara necropolis where the tomb was to be constructed.97 Finally Shepseskaf probably decreed a daily offering of 20 measures of something what was offered is lost in a lacuna of the stone to the senuti shrine.note 11100 Alabaster statuette of Babaef II a vizier of Shepseskaf from his Giza tomb G5230 now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien101 It was during his second year of rule that Shepseskaf recorded the earliest surviving decree from the Old Kingdom period.102103 Inscribed on a limestone slab uncovered in Menkaures mortuary temple the decree concerns the completion of this temple records offerings to be made there and protects the estate and staff of the pyramid of Menkaure by exempting them from taxationnote 1285104 Horus Shepsesket the year after the first occasion of the count of cattle and herds ... which was done in the presence of the King himself. The King of Upper and Lower Egypt Shepseskaf. For the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Menkaure he set up a monument a pekher offering ... in the pyramid of Menkaure ... With regard to the pekher offering brought for the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Menkaure ... priestly duty is done with respect to it for ever. ... it should never be taken away by someone in the course of his duty for ever ... the pyramid of Menkaure .... My majesty does not permit ... servants ... priests ...105 Excavations of Menkaures mortuary temple confirm that it was probably left unfinished at this pharaohs death. Originally planned to be made of granite then altered to be completed of white Turah limestone106 all stone construction ceased and the temple was hastily finished in crude bricks during Shepseskafs rule.107 This material allows for rapid construction.106 Shepseskafs works concerned the causeway and entrance corridors of the temple its great open court storerooms and inner temple as well as the exterior walls. All brick constructions were covered in yellow mud then plastered white and left plain except for the walls of the great open court which were made into a system of niches.106 The completed doorways were fitted with wooden doors and the temple floors were of beaten mud on packed limestone chips while the great court received a stone flooring.108 Further activities are reported in Herodotus account of the late fourth dynasty.109 According to Herodotus Menkaure was succeeded by a king whom he calls Asukhisnote 13 who built an outer court of Hephaestuss Ptahs temple decreed a new law on borrowing to remedy the lack of money in circulation during his reign and built a brick pyramid.note 14 109 Herodotuss account cannot easily be reconciled with the historical reality and seems to stem from confusion between fourth and 
24 th dynasty rulers111 garbled references to legends regarding a second dynasty king as lawgiver and 
12 th dynasty brick pyramids of Dahshur such as that of Amenemhat III.112 As Diodorus Siculus makes similar mistakes in reporting the history of the fourth dynasty  notably both he and Herodotus incorrectly believed the fourth dynasty came after the 
20 th110  it is possible that it was their sources in Egypt which were at fault.113 Court lifeedit Some of the officials who served under Shepseskaf are known from the funerary inscriptions they made on their tombs and which mention the king. These are mostly found in Giza and Saqqara. The fact that many of these inscriptions only mention Shepseskaf without further details hints at the short duration of his reign. The court officials who mentioned Shepseskaf include Babaef II vizier under Shepseskaf and possibly his cousin114 Sekhemkare a son of Khafre priest of the royal funerary cultsnote 15 Nisutpunetjer who was a priest of the royal funerary cultsnote 16 Ptahshepses I who was educated among the royal children in Shepseskafs palace and harem118 later promoted to the office of priest of Ptah by Userkaf and soninlaw of this pharaoh119 and Kaunisut a palace official priest and director of hairdressers.120121 End of dynastyedit The division of ancient Egyptian kings into dynasties is an invention of Manethos Aegyptiaca intended to adhere more closely to the expectations of Manethos patrons the Greek rulers of Ptolemaic Egypt.122 The historical reality of these dynasties is difficult to appraise and they might not correspond to the modern conception for that term for example Djoser the first king of the third dynasty was the son of Khasekhemwy final king of the Second dynasty.note 17124 Stadelmann and Brta remark that Shepseskaf which means His Ka is noble and Userkaf have much in common for example their throne names both follow the same pattern qualifying the Ka of Ra as noble for the former and strong for the laternote 3 and they probably belonged to the same family with Userkaf being either Shepseskafs son6263 or his brother.125 In addition the biographies of officials serving at the time show no break in their careers at the juncture of the fourth and fifth dynasties and no traces of religious political or economic upheavals at the time.note 1829 Some distinction between the fourth and fifth dynasties may nonetheless have been recognised by the ancient Egyptians as recorded by a tradition much oldernote 19 than Manethos128 and found in the tale of the Westcar Papyrus. In this story King Khufu is foretold the demise of his line and the rise of a new dynasty through the accession of three sons of Ra to the throne of Egypt.note 20132 In modern Egyptology no sharp division is understood to have taken place between the fourth and fifth dynasties.133 Yet some transition between them is perceived through the evolution of the Egyptian state at the time from one where all power and positions of prestige were taken by the royal family to one where the stateadministration was opened to people of nonroyal descent. It is in the interval from Menkaure to Userkaf that the royal family began to step back from the highest offices in particular that of the vizier.134 Shepseskaf Userkaf and their fifth dynasty successors responded to these changes by designing new means of asserting their supremacy and religious influence through the cult of Ra the creation of novel offices of state135 and changes in the kings role.136 Ras primacy over the rest of the Egyptian pantheon and the increased royal devotion given to him made Ra a sort of stategod43137 a novelty in comparison with the earlier fourth dynasty when more emphasis was put on royal burials.138 Burialedit Main article Mastabat alFiraun Shepseskafs tomb is a great mastaba at South Saqqara. Called Qbpssk3.f Qebeh Shepseskaf by the ancient Egyptians this name is variously translated as Shepseskaf is pure77 Shepseskaf is purified Coolness of King Shepseskaf139 and The cool place of Shepseskaf.8 Nowadays it is known as Mastabat alFiraun meaning bench of the pharaoh in Egyptian Arabic. This mastaba was first recognised as such by Richard Lepsius who listed it as structure XLIII in his pioneering list of pyramids.140 First excavated in 1858 by Auguste Mariette it was not before the years 19241925 that the mastaba was thoroughly explored by Gustave Jquier.3141 Locationedit Mastabat alFiraun Saqqara Shepseskafs decision to be buried in South Saqqara represents a departure from the Giza necropolis used by his predecessors. The reason for this choice is debated. Verner remarks that this choice had political symbolism93 as it allowed Shepseskaf a greater proximity to the dynasty founder Sneferus red and bent pyramids in Dahshur possibly emphasising his belonging to the dynastic line.142 For Brta Shepseskaf simply decided to come back to the traditional burial grounds of Saqqara and Abusir a choice that therefore does not need to be seen as a sign of religious conflicts within the royal family143 as had been proposed by Hassan.144 However the main reason might have been economic or practical rather than political or religious.145 There was simply not enough space left in Giza for another large pyramid complex142 and the proximity of limestone quarries to South Saqqara could have played a role.146 Egyptologist Adolf Erman instead conjectures that the choice of location for a pharaohs tomb was mostly dictated by the vicinity of his palace which could change owing to economic political and military interests.147 This remains unverified as no palace of an Old Kingdom king has been located so far147148 and it may be instead that it was the centre of the administration and royal house which followed the funerary complex rather than the other way around.149 Decision to build a mastabaedit As Shepseskaf chose to have a mastaba built for himself he broke with the fourth dynasty tradition of constructing pyramids. Several theories have been put forth to explain this choice. First Verner hypothesises that Shepseskaf may have designed a mastaba as a temporary measure because he was faced with the arduous task of completing Menkaures pyramid complex at Giza while simultaneously having to start his own tomb.142 In this theory Shepseskaf may have intended to turn the mastaba into a pyramid at a later stage.93 In support of this theory is the observation that the architecture and layout of the subterranean structures of the mastaba exactly follow the standard plan for royal pyramids.93 Shepseskaf might have been forced to take this decision if Egypt experienced economic difficulties at the time as Verner posits5 or perhaps Menkaures failure to complete his mortuary temple could have made Shepseskaf more cautious about his own tomb.93 At the opposite Egyptologist Stephen Quirke believes that Shepseskafs tomb amounts to the first step of a planned step pyramid that was unfinished owing to its owners early death only to be completed by his successor or his queen in the shape of a mastaba.150 This theory finds some support in the Palermo stone which indicates that the emplacement and name of Shepseskafs tomb were chosen during his first year on the throne. In this text the name of the tomb is written with the determinative of a pyramid rather than that of a mastaba151 but in the tomb of Nikauhor who worked as overseer of Shepseskafs tomb it appears with the determinative of a mastaba.note 21139153 Alternatively Hassan has put forward the idea that Shepseskaf may have deliberately chosen to build a mastaba owing to religiopolitical reasons as the pyramid shape is closely associated with the solar cult.note 22 In doing so he would have tried to undermine the growing influence of the priesthood of Ra.154 This hypothesis could also explain the absence of a direct theophoric reference to Ra in his name as well as in that of his probable immediate successor Userkaf.note 23 Hassan who believes Khentkaus I was Shepseskafs consort further conjectures that Khentkaus was forced to marry Userkaf the high priest of Ra after Shepseskafs death.4 This marriage would have sealed the unrivalled ascendancy of the solar cult throughout the fifth dynasty.38 Egyptologist Jaromir Mlek concurs in part with this hypothesis seeing Shepseskafs decision as the symptom of a possible religious crisis.10 The archaeologist Joyce Tyldesley notes that if Shepseskaf really did intend his tomb to be a mastaba and regardless of his motivations this indicates that while a pyramid may be desirable it was not an absolute necessity for a pharaoh to reach the afterlife.41 In a fourth opinion Brta who stresses that the reasons for Shepseskafs choice largely elude us nonetheless proposes that the king may have lacked full legitimacy after ascending the throne from his position of high official through marriage.24 In this hypothesis Shepseskaf would be a son of Khentkaus I. While in all probability related to the fourth dynasty royal family he may not have had the legitimacy that prince Khuenre the firstborn son of Menkaure and queen Khamerernebty II had enjoyed prior to his death. Possibly faced with opponents and a stateadministration increasingly from outside of the royal family he could have chosen to build a nontypical tomb fitting his peculiar status.155 Architectureedit Entrance to the mastabas subterranean chambers The mastaba oriented on a northsouth axis is rectangular in shape with a base of 
99.6  m  
74.4  m 327 ft  244 ft and a height of 18 m 59 ft.41 The outer slope of its wall is 65156 or 70 and it may have risen in two steps.157 The tomb dimensions are deemed very small and modest by Verner as compared with the great pyramids of Shepseskafs fourth dynasty predecessors.158 Indeed the total volume of the mastaba masonry represents no more than a third that of Menkaures pyramid. For Verner and Egyptologist Abeer ElShahawy this could be explained by the decline in the economic prosperity of Egypt at the time as well as a decline in the kings power.45 At the opposite for Stadelmann one should not conclude that political instability or economic difficulties prevented Menkaure Shepseskaf and their successors from emulating the great pyramids of their forebears. Instead he proposes that the main impetus behind Menkaures smaller pyramid and for Shepseskafs decision to have a mastaba made for himself is a cultic change where the pyramid is replaced as the centre of appearance and importance by the mortuary temple as the centre of the funerary ritual.2 In spite of its reduced size Shepseskafs tomb and funerary complex were probably unfinished at the death of the king something which is taken to confirm a short reign. Excavations have shown that parts of the associated mortuary temple as well as the entirety of the causeway leading to it from the Nile valley have been hastily93 completed in mudbrick probably by one of his successors.93159 The narrow ends of the mastaba were deliberately raised unlike the traditional fashion making the tomb look like a great sarcophagus3158 or the hieroglyphic determinative for a shrine.note 24142 The mastaba was originally clad with white Turah limestone except for its lower course which was clad in red granite.41157 The entrance to the substructures is on the mastabas northern face from where a nearly 
20.9 5 m 
68.7  ft long rockcut passageway descends at 2330157 to an antechamber the access to which was to be protected by three portcullises. To the southeast of the antechamber is a room with six niches possibly storerooms while west of the antechamber lies the burial chamber. Measuring 
7.7 9 m  
3.8 5 m 
25.6  ft  
12.6  ft it is lined with granite and has a 
4.9  m 16 ft high arched ceiling sculpted into a false vault.157 Remnants of a decorated dark basalt sarcophagus were uncovered there although the burial chamber was never finished and in all probability never used.41 The mastaba was surrounded by a double enclosure wall of mudbricks. On the eastern face of the tomb was a mortuary temple with an offering hall false door and five storerooms the layout of which later served as template for Neferirkare Kakais temple.160161 No niches meant to house statues of the king were found although fragments of a statue of Shepseskaf in the style of those of Khafre and Menkaure were uncovered in the temple.162 To the east lay a small inner court and a larger outer one. Remnants of a causeway have been found it is supposed to have led to a valley temple which has yet to be located.157 Legacyedit Old Kingdomedit Like other pharaohs of the fourth and fifth dynasties Shepseskaf was the object of an official funerary cult after his death. This cult seems to have been relatively minor when compared to those given to his predecessors. Only three priests serving in this cult are known163 including Shepseskafs probable daughter queen Bunefer.46 This contrasts with the at least 73164 and 21165 priests known to have served in the cults of Khufu and Menkaure respectively. Furthermore no evidence for Shepseskafs cult has been found beyond the mid fifth dynasty while the cults of some of his close successors lasted beyond the end of the Old Kingdom.166 Provisions for these official mortuary cults were produced in agricultural estates set up during the rulers reign. Possibly owing to the short duration of his reign only two such estates are known for Shepseskaf167 compared with at least sixty for Khufu.168 In parallel to the official cult it seems that Shepseskafs name and memory were especially well regarded at least as late as the second half of the fifth dynasty as attested by at least seven169 high officials bearing the name Shepseskafankh meaning May Shepseskaf live or Shepseskaf lives up until the reign of Nyuserre Ini.170171 This includes a royal physician172 a royal estate steward173174 a courtier175 a priest176 and a judicial official.177 Middle Kingdomedit While no trace of statesponsored cult of Shepseskaf have been uncovered from the late Old Kingdom and First Intermediate periods Jquier discovered a Middle Kingdom stele during his excavations of Shepseskafs mortuary temple. At that time the vicinity of the mastaba had become a necropolis housing tombs from the lower strata of society.178 The stele uncovered by Jquier probably originated from a nearby tomb and had been reused at a later time as paving for the temple floor.179 The stele indicates that some sort of popular cult had been revived by the 
12 th dynasty on the premises of the temple.179 Dedicated by a butcher named Ptahhotep the stele depicts Ptahhotep and his family seemingly officiating a fully functioning cult with its priests scribes and servants.180181 Contrary to the Old Kingdom statesponsored cult honouring Shepseskaf the main object of this cult was not Shepseskaf himself but the dead of the surrounding necropolis for whom people were making offerings offerings which only the gods could give the dead after accepting them thanks to Shepseskafs intercession.182 For Jquier this cult had been turned into a lucrative activity by Ptahhoteps family.183184 New Kingdomedit Along with other royal monuments at Saqqara and Abusir which had fallen into ruin Shepseskafs mastaba was the object of restoration works under the impulse of prince Khaemwaset a son of Ramses II.185 This was possibly to appropriate stones for his fathers construction projects while ensuring a minimal restoration for cultic purposes.186 Notesedit  a b Proposed dates for the reign of Shepseskaf 25232519 BC2345 ending 2510 BC6 25112506 BC78 250425

Samples dated to specific reigns were collected from museum collections and excavation material while certain types of material notably charcoal and mummified remains were avoided owing to their susceptibility to contamination.27  a b c The word his here may refer to the god Ra rather than to the pharaoh.29  a b Direct fatherson relationships between Old Kingdom pharaohs are never explicitly reported in contemporary documents. Furthermore no official title is known to have designated the crown prince before his accession to the throne. This makes such relationships difficult to assert beyond doubt from purely archaeological evidence.33  Of particular importance is an unusual title of Khentkaus I which seems to indicate that she was the mother of two kings.37  Buried in Giza tomb G8408 she bore the title of njswt sA.t n Xt f meaning royal daughter of his body but her fathers identity remains in doubt.45  She may have participated in his burial ceremonies.45  a b Although the surviving fragments of the Palermo stone itself probably date to the much later 
25 th dynasty fl. 760656 BC they were certainly copied or compiled from Old Kingdom sources.66 These themselves date to the first half of the fifth dynasty possibly under Neferirkares rule as the annals record no event after that.6768 In addition Patrick OMara has shown that the Old Kingdom source itself used earlier royal annals probably first written in the time span between Menkaures and Userkafs reigns i.e. possibly during Shepseskafs.69  This part of the Palermo stone is actually ascribed to the Early Dynastic Period specifically the transition between Aha and Djer.  During the Old Kingdom period the Egyptians did not record time as we do today. Rather they counted years since the beginning of the reign of the current king. Furthermore these years were referred to by the number of cattle counts which had taken place since the start of the reign. The cattle count was an important event aimed at evaluating the amount of taxes to be levied on the population. This involved counting cattle oxen and small livestock.85 During the first half of the fifth dynasty this count might have been biennial86 although it may not always have happened at regular intervals.87 Following these principles these inscriptions talk of the year after the first cattle count of Shepseskafs reign. If the count was indeed biennial which is uncertain this would correspond to his second regnal year.84  A mastaba takes time to build and the unfinished state of the tomb gives some indication on the reign duration as works on the royal tomb started in the kings first year of reign and either stopped or were interrupted at the death of the king. Depending on the final state of the originally planned tomb one can thus estimate on the maximum duration of the kings reign. Had Shepseskaf reigned longer than four years his mastaba would have been more advanced at his death than it is according to Verner.93  Senuti shrine transliteration snwt.98 This might designate a building perhaps marked by snake stelae possibly at Heliopolis.99  The decree now fragmentary and damaged is currently housed in the Egyptian Museum under the temporary number

8.1 03  Also called Aseskaf.110  Herodotuss account is as follows After Mycerinus the priests said Asukhis became king of Egypt. He built the eastern outer court of Hephaestuss temple this is by far the finest and grandest of all the courts for while all have carved figures and innumerable felicities of architecture this court has far more than any. As not much money was in circulation during this kings reign they told me a law was made for the Egyptians allowing a man to borrow on the security of his fathers corpse and the law also provided that the lender become master of the entire burialvault of the borrower and that the penalty for one giving this security should he fail to repay the loan was that he was not to be buried at his death either in that tomb of his fathers or in any other nor was he to bury any relative of his there. Furthermore in his desire to excel all who ruled Egypt before him this king left a pyramid of brick to commemorate his name on which is this writing cut on a stone Do not think me less than pyramids of stone for I excel them as much as Zeus does other gods for they stuck a pole down into a marsh and collected what mud clung to the pole made bricks of it and thus built me. These were the acts of Asukhis.109  His mastaba located in Giza and now known as G8154 yielded a list of the kings under whom he served from Khafre down to Sahure.115116  His mastaba is now known as Giza tomb G87
40.1 17  To quote Stadelmann on the subject With Userkaf Manetho begins a new dynasty. Recent historical research however suggests that the delimitation of king lists into dynasties should be viewed with a certain reserve. In any case the reason for the Manethonian division into dynasties seems to be different from that which modern historians would take as a basis. The sparse almost exclusively archaeological knowledge of the monuments simply does not allow any clear statements as to the extent to which such dynasties actually do justice to the historical reality of the Old Kingdom.123  For Jquier though the very fact that Shepseskaf had a mastaba built for himself rather than a pyramid could be evidence of such troubles.126  This tale dates to the 
17 th fl. c.
16 th century BC or possibly the 
12 th dynasty fl. c.
19 th century BC.127  In the tale the first three kings of the fifth dynasty are said to be brothers but it is now known thanks to archaeological evidences that Userkaf Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai had fatherson relationships with one another.129130131  Jank Vymazalov and Coppens note in passing that this sign could be a schematic depiction of the mastabalike tomb ... of pharaoh Shepseskaf.152  Verner is explicitly against this hypothesis qualifying it as erroneous.5  Against this opinion Stadelmann thinks that the Ka in Shepseskafs and Userkafs names does refer to the soul of Ra.29  That is the mastaba took the shape of a Buto shrine with a rounded vaulted top between vertical ends.157 Referencesedit  a b Schneider 2002 p. 248.  a b c d e Stadelmann 2001 p. 597.  a b c Chauvet 2001 p. 176.  a b c ElShahawy  Atiya 2005 p. 33.  a b c d e Verner 20
