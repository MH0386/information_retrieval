29 th Dynasty according to an account preserved in a papyrus in the Brooklyn Museum by defeating Amyrtaeus in open battle and later putting him to death at Memphis. Nefaarud then made Mendes his capital. On Nefaaruds death two rival factions fought for the throne one behind his son Muthis and the other supporting a usurper Psammuthes although Psammuthes was successful he only managed to reign for a year. Psammuthes was overthrown by Hakor who claimed to be the grandson of Nefaarud I. He successfully resisted Persian attempts to reconquer Egypt drawing support from Athens until the Peace of Antalcidas in 387 BC and from the rebel king of Cyprus Evagoras. Although his son Nefaarud II became king on his death the younger Nefaarud was unable to keep hold of his inheritance. Pharaohs of the
