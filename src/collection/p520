53 present Egypt portal v t e In ancient Egyptian history the Old Kingdom is the period spanning c.27002200 BC. It is also known as the Age of the Pyramids or the Age of the Pyramid Builders as it encompasses the reigns of the great pyramidbuilders of the Fourth Dynasty such as King Sneferu who perfected the art of pyramidbuilding and the kings Khufu Khafre and Menkaure who constructed the pyramids at Giza.3 Egypt attained its first sustained peak of civilization during the Old Kingdom the first of three socalled Kingdom periods followed by the Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom which mark the high points of civilization in the lower Nile Valley.4 The concept of an Old Kingdom as one of three golden ages was coined in 1845 by the German Egyptologist Baron von Bunsen and its definition would evolve significantly throughout the 
19 th and the 
20 th centuries.5 Not only was the last king of the Early Dynastic Period related to the first two kings of the Old Kingdom but the capital the royal residence remained at InebHedj the Ancient Egyptian name for Memphis. The basic justification for a separation between the two periods is the revolutionary change in architecture accompanied by the effects on Egyptian society and the economy of largescale building projects.4 The Old Kingdom is most commonly regarded as the period from the Third Dynasty to the Sixth Dynasty 26862181 BC. Information from the Fourth to the Sixth Dynasties of Egypt is scarce and historians regard the history of the era as literally written in stone and largely architectural in that it is through the monuments and their inscriptions that scholars have been able to construct a history.3 Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth Dynasties in the Old Kingdom as a continuation of the administration centralized at Memphis. While the Old Kingdom was a period of internal security and prosperity it was followed by a period of disunity and relative cultural decline referred to by Egyptologists as the First Intermediate Period.6 During the Old Kingdom the King of Egypt not called the Pharaoh until the New Kingdom became a living god who ruled absolutely and could demand the services and wealth of his subjects.7 Under King Djoser the first king of the Third Dynasty of the Old Kingdom the royal capital of Egypt was moved to Memphis where Djoser established his court. A new era of building was initiated at Saqqara under his reign. King Djosers architect Imhotep is credited with the development of building with stone and with the conception of the new architectural form the step pyramid.7 The Old Kingdom is best known for a large number of pyramids constructed at this time as burial places for Egypts kings. Historyedit Rise of the Old Kingdomedit Main article Third Dynasty of Egypt The first King of the Old Kingdom was Djoser sometime between 2691 and 2625 BC of the Third Dynasty who ordered the construction of a pyramid the Step Pyramid in Memphis necropolis Saqqara. An important person during the reign of Djoser was his vizier Imhotep. It was in this era that formerly independent ancient Egyptian states became known as nomes under the rule of the king. The former rulers were forced to assume the role of governors or otherwise work in tax collection. Egyptians in this era believed the king to be the incarnation of Horus linking the human and spiritual worlds. Egyptian views on the nature of time during this period held that the universe worked in cycles and the Pharaoh on earth worked to ensure the stability of those cycles. They also perceived themselves as specially selected people.8 The Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara. The Temple of Djoser at Saqqara The head of a King c.26502600 BC Brooklyn Museum. The earliest representations of Egyptian Kings are on a small scale. From the Third Dynasty statues were made showing the ruler lifesize. This head wearing the crown of Upper Egypt is larger than human scale.9 Height of the Old Kingdomedit Main article Fourth Dynasty of Egypt The Great Sphinx of Giza in front of the Great Pyramid of Giza The Old Kingdom and its royal power reached a zenith under the Fourth Dynasty 26132494 BC. King Sneferu the first king of the Fourth Dynasty held territory from ancient Libya in the west to the Sinai Peninsula in the east to Nubia in the south. An Egyptian settlement was founded at Buhen in Nubia which endured for 200 years.10 After Djoser Sneferu was the next great pyramid builder. He commissioned the building of not one but three pyramids. The first is called the Meidum Pyramid named for its location in Egypt. Sneferu abandoned it after the outside casing fell off of the pyramid. The Meidum pyramid was the first to have an aboveground burial chamber.11 Using more stones than any other Pharaoh he built the three pyramids a now collapsed pyramid in Meidum the Bent Pyramid at Dahshur and the Red Pyramid at North Dahshur. However the full development of the pyramid style of building was reached not at Saqqara but during the building of the Great Pyramids at Giza.12 Sneferu was succeeded by his son Khufu 25892566 BC who built the Great Pyramid of Giza. After Khufus death his sons Djedefre 25662558 BC and Khafre 25582532 BC may have quarrelled. The latter built the second pyramid and in traditional thinking the Great Sphinx of Giza. Recent reexamination of evidence has led Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev to propose that the Sphinx was built by Djedefre as a monument to his father Khufu.
13 Alternatively the Sphinx has been proposed to be the work of Khafre and Khufu himself. There were military expeditions into Canaan and Nubia with Egyptian influence reaching up the Nile into what is today Sudan.14 The later kings of the Fourth Dynasty were Menkaure 25322504 BC who built the smallest of the three great pyramids in Giza Shepseskaf 25042498 BC and perhaps Djedefptah 24982496 BC. Khufu the builder of the Great Pyramid at Giza Fifth Dynastyedit Main article Fifth Dynasty of Egypt The Fifth Dynasty 24942345 BC began with Userkaf 24942487 BC and was marked by the growing importance of the cult of sun god Ra. Consequently fewer efforts were devoted to the construction of pyramid complexes than during the Fourth Dynasty and more to the construction of sun temples in Abusir. Userkaf was succeeded by his son Sahure 24872475 BC who commanded an expedition to Punt. Sahure was in turn succeeded by Neferirkare Kakai 24752455 BC who was Sahures son. Neferirkare introduced the prenomen in the royal titulary. He was followed by two shortlived kings his son Neferefre 24552453 BC and Shepseskare the latter of uncertain parentage.15 Shepseskare may have been deposed by Neferefres brother Nyuserre Ini 24452421 BC a longlived pharaoh who built extensively in Abusir and restarted royal activity in Giza. The last pharaohs of the dynasty were Menkauhor Kaiu 24212414 BC Djedkare Isesi 24142375 BC and Unas 23752345 the earliest ruler to have the Pyramid Texts inscribed in his pyramid. Egypts expanding interests in trade goods such as ebony incense such as myrrh and frankincense gold copper and other useful metals inspired the ancient Egyptians to build suitable ships for navigation of the open sea. They traded with Lebanon for cedar and travelled the length of the Red Sea to the Kingdom of Punt modernday Eritreafor ebony ivory and aromatic resins.16 Shipbuilders of that era did not use pegs treenails or metal fasteners but relied on the rope to keep their ships assembled. Planks and the superstructure were tightly tied and bound together. This period also witnessed direct trade between Egypt and its Aegean neighbors and Anatolia.17 The rulers of the dynasty sent expeditions to the stone quarries and gold mines of Nubia and the mines of Sinai.18192021 there are references and depictions of military campaigns in Nubia and Asia.222324 Decline into the First Intermediate Periodedit Main articles Sixth Dynasty of Egypt and First Intermediate Period The sixth dynasty peaked during the reigns of Pepi I and Merenre I with flourishing trade several mining and quarrying expeditions and major military campaigns. Militarily aggressive expansion into Nubia marked Pepi Is reign.2526 At least five military expeditions were sent into Canaan.27 There is evidence that Merenre was not only active in Nubia like Pepi I but also sent officials to maintain Egyptian rule over Nubia from the northern border to the area south of the third cataract.27 During the Sixth Dynasty 23452181 BC the power of the pharaoh gradually weakened in favor of powerful nomarchs regional governors. These no longer belonged to the royal family and their charge became hereditary thus creating local dynasties largely independent from the central authority of the Pharaoh. However Nile flood control was still the subject of very large works including especially the canal to Lake Moeris around 2300 BC which was likely also the source of water to the Giza pyramid complex centuries earlier. Internal disorders set in during the incredibly long reign of Pepi II 22782184 BC towards the end of the dynasty. His death certainly well past that of his intended heirs might have created succession struggles. The country slipped into civil wars mere decades after the close of Pepi IIs reign. The final blow was the 
22 nd century BC drought in the region that resulted in a drastic drop in precipitation. For at least some years between 2200 and 2150 BC this prevented the normal flooding of the Nile.28 Whatever its cause the collapse of the Old Kingdom was followed by decades of famine and strife. An important inscription on the tomb of Ankhtifi a nomarch during the early First Intermediate Period describes the pitiful state of the country when famine stalked the land. Artedit The most defining feature of ancient Egyptian art is its function as that was the entire purpose of creation. Art was not made for enjoyment in the strictest sense but rather served a role of some kind in Egyptian religion and ideology.29 This fact manifests itself in the artistic style even as it evolved over the dynasties. The three primary principles of that style frontality composite composition and hierarchy scale illustrate this quite well.29 These characteristics initiated in the Early Dynastic Period30 and solidified during the Old Kingdom persisted with some adaptability throughout the entirety of ancient Egyptian history as the foundation of its art.31 False door from the Tomb of Metjetji. ca. 23532323 BC Dynasty 56 Old Kingdom. Tomb of Metjetji at Saqqara.32 Frontality the first principle indicates that art was viewed directly from the front. One was meant to approach a piece as they would a living individual for it was meant to be a place of manifestation. The act of interaction would bring forth the divine entity represented in the art.29 It was therefore imperative that whoever was represented be as identifiable as possible. The guidelines developed in the Old Kingdom and the later grid system developed in the Middle Kingdom ensured that art was axial symmetrical proportional and most importantly reproducible and therefore recognizable.33 Composite composition the second principle also contributes to the goal of identification. Multiple perspectives were used in order to ensure that the onlooker could determine precisely what they saw.29 Though Egyptian art almost always includes descriptive text literacy rates were not high so the art gave another method for communicating the same information. One of the best examples of composite composition is the human form. In most twodimensional relief the head legs and feet are seen in profile while the torso faces directly front. Another common example is an aerial view of a building or location.29 The third principle the hierarchy of scale illustrates relative importance in society. The larger the figure the more important the individual. The king is usually the largest aside from deities. The similarity in size equated to similarity in position. However this is not to say that physical differences were not shown as well. Women for example are usually shown as smaller than men. Children retain adult features and proportions but are substantially smaller in size.29 Aside from the three primary conventions there are several characteristics that can help date a piece to a particular time frame. Proportions of the human figure are one of the most distinctive as they vary between kingdoms.33 Old Kingdom male figures have characteristically broad shoulders and a long torso with obvious musculature. On the other hand females are narrower in the shoulders and waist with longer legs and a shorter torso.33 However in the Sixth Dynasty the male figures lose their muscularity and their shoulders narrow. The eyes also tend to get much larger.29 In order to help maintain the consistency of these proportions the Egyptians used a series of eight guidelines to divide the body. They occurred at the following locations the top of the head the hairline the base of the neck the underarms the tip of the elbow or the bottom of the ribcage the top of the thigh at the bottom of the buttocks the knee and the middle of the lower leg.33 From the soles of the feet to the hairline was also divided into thirds onethird between the soles and the knee another third between the knee and the elbow and the final third from the elbow to the hairline. The broad shoulders that appeared in the Fifth Dynasty constituted roughly that onethird length as well.33 These proportions not only help with the identification of representations and the reproduction of art but also tie into the Egyptian ideal of order which tied into the solar aspect of their religion and the inundations of the Nile.29 A statue of Menkaure with Hathor and Anput from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Demonstrates a group statue of graywacke with Old Kingdom features and proportions.34 Though the above concepts apply to most if not all figures in Egyptian art there are additional characteristics that applied to the representations of the king. Their appearance was not an exact rendering of the kings visage though kings are somewhat identifiable through looks alone. Identification could be supplied by inscriptions or context.29 A huge more important part of a kings portrayal was about the idea of the office of kingship29 which were dependent on the time period. The Old Kingdom was considered a golden age for Egypt a grandiose height to which all future kingdoms aspired.35 As such the king was portrayed as young and vital with features that agreed with the standards of beauty of the time. The musculature seen in male figures was also applied to kings. A royal rite the jubilee run which was established during the Old Kingdom involved the king running around a group of markers that symbolized the geographic borders of Egypt. This was meant to be a demonstration of the kings physical vigor which determined his capacity to continue his reign.35 This idea of kingly youth and strength were pervasive in the Old Kingdom and thus shown in the art.31 The sculpture was a major product of the Old Kingdom. The position of the figures in this period was mostly limited to sitting or standing either with feet together or in the striding pose. Group statues of the king with either gods or family members typically his wife and children were also common.30 It was not just the subject of sculpture that was important but also the material The use of hard stone such as gneiss graywacke schist and granite was relatively common in the Old Kingdom.36 The color of the stone had a great deal of symbolism and was chosen deliberately.29 Four colors were distinguished in the ancient Egyptian language black green red and white.36 Black was associated with Egypt due to the color of the soil after the Nile flood green with vegetation and rebirth red with the sun and its regenerative cycle and white with purity.29 The statue of Menkaure with Hathor and Anput is an example of a typical Old Kingdom sculpture. The three figures display frontality and axiality while fitting with the proportions of this time period. The graywacke came from the Eastern Desert in Egypt37 and is therefore associated with rebirth and the rising of the sun in the east. Galleryedit King khufu statue at Cairo museum.
