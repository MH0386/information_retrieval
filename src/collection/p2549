Balfour Gardiner brother Martin Bernal grandson John Eliot Gardiner grandson Sir Alan Henderson Gardiner FBA 29 March 1879  19 December 1963 was an English Egyptologist linguist philologist and independent scholar. He is regarded as one of the premier Egyptologists of the early and mid
20 th century. Personal lifeedit Gardiner was born on 29 March 1879 in Eltham which was then in the English county of Kent. His mother died in his infancy and he and his elder brother the composer H. Balfour Gardiner were brought up by their fathers housekeeper. Gardiner was educated at Temple Grove School and Charterhouse. At school he developed an interest in ancient Egypt and in 189596 he studied under the French archaeologist Gaston Maspero in Paris. He then went to Queens College Oxford with a scholarship to study Literae humaniores classics. Having achieved a second class in Mods he changed to Hebrew and Arabic graduating with a first class Bachelor of Arts BA degree in 19
01.1  He was later a student of the prominent Egyptologist Kurt Heinrich Sethe in Berlin.2 In 1901 after graduating he married Hedwig von Rosen in Vienna. They had two sons and a daughter including the rural revivalist campaigner Rolf Gardiner and Margaret Gardiner a patron of the arts.1 Gardiner moved to Iffley near Oxford in 1947. He died here on 19 December 1963 and after cremation his ashes were interred in Iffley churchyard.1 Careeredit In 1902 Gardiner moved to Berlin to help gather material for Adolf Ermans projected Egyptian dictionary serving as a subeditor from 1906 to 1908. From 1906 to 1912 he was the Laycock Fellow of Egyptology at Worcester College Oxford.3 From 1909 he spent two seasons assisting Arthur Weigall in surveying private tombs in the Thebes area. From 1912 to 1914 he was Reader in Egyptology at the University of Manchester. He otherwise avoided formal academic posts and followed his own academic interests family wealth enabling him to be financially independent.1 He was an honorary fellow of The Queens College Oxford his alma mater from 1935 until his death.1 Returning to Egypt in 1915 while working on inscriptions at Serabit elKhadim in the Sinai Peninsula he identified an unknown hieroglyphic script as the earliest known Semitic alphabet probably the ancestor of all later Semitic and European ones.1 After Howard Carter discovered the nearintact tomb of Tutankhamun in November 1922 Gardiner provided advice and support. This included helping to decipher inscriptions and seal impressions found in the tomb and advising on Lord Carnarvons exclusive contract with The Times and during the 192425 legal dispute with the Egyptian Department of Antiquities on access to the partlyexcavated tomb.4 Gardiner continued to research and publish books and articles until the early 19
60 s.5 He however exercised an influence on Egyptology far beyond his publications. Although he held no important academic post he was universally respected as a senior member of the academic community and was often consulted on academic appointments.1 He was a prominent figure in the Egypt Exploration Fund and served as honorary secretary for 1917 to 1920 and later served as its president.5 During his career Gardiner obtained a number of academic honours including DLitt from Oxford 1910 Fellow of the British Academy 19291 election to the American Philosophical Society 19436 an honorary DLitt from both Durham 1952 and Cambridge 19565 and election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 19
57.7  He was knighted in the 1948 Birthday Honours list.8 Worksedit Gardiners publications include a 1959 book on his study of The Royal Canon of Turin and his 1961 work Egypt of the Pharaohs which covered all aspects of Egyptian chronology and history at the time of publication.

Publishing Egyptian Grammar produced one of the few available hieroglyphic printing fonts. In 1914 he helped establish the Egypt Exploration Funds Journal of Egyptian Archaeology which he edited intermittently between 1916 and 19
