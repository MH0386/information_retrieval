The principal figure behind the plot was one of the pharaohs secondary wives Tiye who hoped to place her son Pentawer on the throne instead of the pharaohs chosen successor Ramesses IV but mainly organized by the court official Pebekkamen. The plotters succeeded in killing the pharaoh but failed to establish Pentawer on the throne. In the aftermath the leading conspirators were convicted and executed. Ramesses IIIedit Further information Ramesses III Ramesses III was born during the Twentieth Dynasty to his father Pharaoh Setnakhte and mother Queen TiyMerenese. His father Setnakhte came to the throne by rescuing Egypt from the hands of foreign powers.citation needed After Ramesses II or Ramesses The Great outlived twelve of his sons Egypt was put in the hands of others. Setnakhte led Egypt into the Twentieth Dynasty. It is said that Ramesses III entered life destined for the kingship and remained at the pinnacle of society and power throughout.1 Ramesses III ruled Egypt for 32 years. He had recently relocated to Thebes to celebrate the HebSed the rejuvenation festival that occurs after a king rules for thirty years and it continues to take place every three years thereafter. It was in Thebes where this great conspiracy was performed.2 Conspiracyedit Ramesses IV the appointed heir of Ramesses III On day 15 of month 2 of Shemu 1155 BC Ramesses III was likely in the royal harem in the Western Tower of Medinet Habu when the attempt on his life was made. This date was chosen as it coincided with the Beautiful Festival of the Valley the commotion surrounding the event was used to the advantage of the conspirators.3 A minor wife of the king Tiye wished for her son Pentawer to take the throne instead of Ramesses IV the chosen successor. To achieve this Tiye enlisted a group of officials throughout the administration as well as servants to help deliver messages beyond the harem. Tiye was also able to convince many of these officials to help act out the twofold conspiracy. One of the pantry chiefs Pebekkamen was responsible for distributing information ...he had begun to bring out their word to their mothers and their brothers who were there saying Stir up the people Incite enmity in order to make rebellion against their lord4 Pebekkamen received help from a butler named Mastesuria the overseer of cattle Panhayboni overseer of the harem Panouk and clerk of the harem Pendua. Since the harem had very restricted access Panhayboni sought out the overseer of the Kings treasury Pairy to obtain a pass that would allow the conspirators access to the king.3 It was once thought that Ramesses III survived the initial attack only to die some time later. This is due in part to the Judicial Papyrus of Turin which preserves a record of the trials of the conspirators being carried out under his name. The document opens with King UsermareMeriamun l.p.h. Son of Re Ramesses Ruler of Heliopolis l.p.h. said... I commissioned the overseer of the treasury Montemtowe the overseer of the treasury Pefrowe the standardbearer Kara the butler Paibese the butler Kedendenna the butler Baalmahar the butler Peirswene the butler Dhutrekhnefer the kings adjutant Penernute the clerk Mai the clerk of the archives Preemhab the standardbearer of the infantry Hori saying As for the matters which the peopleI do not know whohave plotted go and examine them.5 After giving the instructions to the judges he then reports the following outcomes And they went and examined them and they caused to die by their own hands those whom they caused so to die though I do not know who and they also punished the others though I do not know who. But I had charged them strictly saying Take heed have a care lest you allow that somebody be punished 9 wrongfully by an official who is not over him.5 His mummy appeared to show no outward signs of any injuries and his death was presumed to be a natural one.6 However recent CT scanning of his mummy reveals that his throat was cut to the bone severing the trachea esophagus and blood vessels which would be rapidly fatal.78 This finding confirms the theory that the trial of the conspirators was carried out by Ramesses IV in the name of his father rather than by Ramesses III himself.9 Trial and outcomeedit Further information Judicial Papyrus of Turin Despite being successful in murdering the king the plot failed to place Pentawer on the throne. It is possible that other members of the royal family loyal to the future Ramesses IV reacted quickly to outmaneuvre the conspirators.3 Ramesses IV selected twelve magistrates to investigate and judge the case across five trials. In addition to the chief conspirators named above those who had knowledge of the conspiracy but did not report it were arrested tried and punished. Twentyeight people were executed. These included Pebekkamen Mastesuria Panhayboni Panouk Pentua and Pairy in addition to other harem officials scribes and army officials. Some such as Pentawer were allowed to take their own lives. Four including the two judges and the captain of the police had their ears and noses cut off for cavorting with the accused women.9 The punishment of Queen Tiye is not recorded.3 The mummy known as Unknown Man E is generally considered to be a son of Ramesses III. The body was not embalmed but wrapped in a ritually impure goatskin and placed in an uninscribed coffin. Genetic studies confirmed he has the same Ychromosome haplotype E

1 a and shares half his autosomal DNA with Ramesses III consistent with being his son. It appears that this mummy is that of Pentawer.7 See alsoedit Conspiracies in ancient Egypt Sourcesedit  Redford Susan 2002. The Harem Conspiracy. Northern Illinois Press. pp. XXIV.
