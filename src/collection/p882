56 a Location and excavationedit Karl Richard Lepsius visited the pyramid in the 18
40 s and conducted a brief archaeological survey of the site.2 Fifty years later Flinders Petrie conducted the first comprehensive excavations there.2 Petrie spent several unsuccessful months searching for the entrance into the pyramid on the north face of the pyramid.23 Senusret II had however taken a complete departure from the usual practice of having a corridor on the north side  typical of Old Kingdom and early Middle Kingdom pyramids2  and had instead built a narrow vertical entrance shaft under a princess tomb located about a dozen yards off to east of the southern pyramid face.312 The Czech Egyptologist Miroslav Verner explains that the decision had been made for a combination of religious reasons and to thwart grave robbers. The builders had even constructed the usual small chapel on the north face which typically concealed the entrance.2 Petrie did eventually find the entrance after many months and multiple failed attempts.13 A small team headed by N. B. Millet of the Royal Ontario Museum and the architect J. E. Knudstad has been working at the site of the pyramid town and pyramid since 1989. Their goal is to expand on Petries work by regathering architectural details of the monuments there which Petrie had neglected to record in his reports.5 On 28 June 2019 the pyramid was opened to visitors for the first time since its discovery.14 Mortuary complexedit Main pyramidedit The core of the pyramid was constructed from mudbrick around a stump of four steps of yellow limestone.315 The builders utilized a rock outcropping to anchor the pyramid and reduce construction time and cost. The completed pyramid was originally encased in white limestone though an inscription found by Petrie indicates that the casing was removed in the Nineteenth Dynasty for reuse in a different structure built by Ramesses II. Only remnants of the black granite pyramidion which topped the pyramid have been found.15 The pyramid was protected from flooding by a trench surrounding the perimeter of the pyramid and filled with sand to absorb rainwater.315 Around this trench a stone perimeter wall was built and decorated with deep niches.15 Substructureedit Most pyramids have a substructure entry somewhere on their north face.12 This had been the traditional entry point since Djoser built his step pyramid in the Third Dynasty.16 Although Senusret IIs pyramid was built with a north chapel includedb its real entry was hiddenaway under the floor of a princess tomb to the southeast.316 This was used for the burial rites of the king but was too narrow for use during construction.3 Instead a larger 16 m 52 ft deep construction shaft found further south was used for transporting the sarcophagus and building material into the substructure.316 This was then reworked into a fake burial chamber in an attempt to deceive thieves attempting to enter the kings tomb.16 The base of the construction shaft opens up into a vaulted horizontal corridor.3 The corridor runs north to a vaulted room containing the real entry shaft and a second unexplored shaft that has been flooded by ground water.16 The corridor then continues north with a slight incline leading to the antechamber.316 Part way along a second chamber is found in its west.3 The antechamber contained two passageways one leads from the antechamber to the burial chamber directly west the other located in the south leads around the chamber eventually entering it from the north.17 The winding passage may have served a symbolic purpose allowing the kings spirit to leave the chamber towards the north.18 The burial chamber and labyrinth of passageways were shifted southeast of the vertical axis of the pyramid another deviation from the standard.317 The burial chamber is oriented on the eastwest axis has a vaulted ceiling made from granite blocks and a red granite sarcophagus near its west wall.1920 Despite the precautions taken the burial chamber was found looted of most of its contents by Petrie.21 An alabaster offering table inscribed with Senusret IIs name a gold uraeus and leg bones believed to belong to the king are all that remained of the burial.1821 See alsoedit List of Egyptian pyramids Egyptian pyramid construction techniques Notesedit  Proposed dates for Senusret IIs reign c. 19001880 BCE7 c. 18971878 BCE89 c. 18971877 BCE5 c. 18951878 BCE10 c. 18771870 BCE.11  A staple feature of pyramid complexes since DjedkareIsesi in the Fifth Dynasty.
