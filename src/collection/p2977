By the age of 30 he had created one of the largest empires in history stretching from Greece to northwestern India.1 He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered to be one of historys greatest and most successful military commanders.234 Until the age of 16 Alexander was tutored by Aristotle. In 335 BC shortly after his assumption of kingship over Macedon he campaigned in the Balkans and reasserted control over Thrace and parts of Illyria before marching on the city of Thebes which was subsequently destroyed in battle. Alexander then led the League of Corinth and used his authority to launch the panHellenic project envisaged by his father assuming leadership over all Greeks in their conquest of Persia.56 In 334 BC he invaded the Achaemenid Persian Empire and began a series of campaigns that lasted for 10 years. Following his conquest of Asia Minor Alexander broke the power of Achaemenid Persia in a series of decisive battles including those at Issus and Gaugamela he subsequently overthrew Darius III and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety.e After the fall of Persia the Macedonian Empire held a vast swath of territory between the Adriatic Sea and the Indus River. Alexander endeavored to reach the ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea and invaded India in 326 BC achieving an important victory over Porus an ancient Indian king of presentday Punjab at the Battle of the Hydaspes. Due to the demand of his homesick troops he eventually turned back at the Beas River and later died in 323 BC in Babylon the city of Mesopotamia that he had planned to establish as his empires capital. Alexanders death left unexecuted an additional series of planned military and mercantile campaigns that would have begun with a Greek invasion of Arabia. In the years following his death a series of civil wars broke out across the Macedonian Empire eventually leading to its disintegration at the hands of the Diadochi. With his death marking the start of the Hellenistic period Alexanders legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism that his conquests engendered such as GrecoBuddhism and Hellenistic Judaism. He founded more than twenty cities with the most prominent being the city of Alexandria in Egypt. Alexanders settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture led to the overwhelming dominance of Hellenistic civilization and influence as far east as the Indian subcontinent. The Hellenistic period developed through the Roman Empire into modern Western culture the Greek language became the lingua franca of the region and was the predominant language of the Byzantine Empire until its collapse in the mid
15 th century AD. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of Achilles featuring prominently in the historical and mythical traditions of both Greek and nonGreek cultures. His military achievements and unprecedented enduring successes in battle made him the measure against which many later military leaders would compare themselvesf and his tactics remain a significant subject of study in military academies worldwide.7 Legends of Alexanders exploits coalesced into the thirdcentury Alexander Romance which in the premodern period went through over one hundred recensions translations and derivations and was translated into almost every European vernacular and every language of the Islamic world.8 After the Bible it was the most popular form of European literature.9 Early life Lineage and childhood Archaeological site of Pella Greece Alexanders birthplace Alexander III was born in Pella the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon10 on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of Hekatombaion which probably corresponds to 20 July 356 BC although the exact date is uncertain.1112 He was the son of the erstwhile king of Macedon Philip II and his fourth wife Olympias daughter of Neoptolemus I king of Epirus.
13 g Although Philip had seven or eight wives Olympias was his principal wife for some time likely because she gave birth to Alexander.14 Roman medallion depicting Olympias Alexanders mother Several legends surround Alexanders birth and childhood.15 According to the ancient Greek biographer Plutarch on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip Olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread far and wide before dying away. Sometime after the wedding Philip is said to have seen himself in a dream securing his wifes womb with a seal engraved with a lions image.16 Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations for these dreams that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage indicated by the sealing of her womb or that Alexanders father was Zeus. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexanders divine parentage variously claiming that she had told Alexander or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.16 On the day Alexander was born Philip was preparing a siege on the city of Potidea on the peninsula of Chalcidice. That same day Philip received news that his general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and Paeonian armies and that his horses had won at the Olympic Games. It was also said that on this day the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus one of the Seven Wonders of the World burnt down. This led Hegesias of Magnesia to say that it had burnt down because Artemis was away attending the birth of Alexander.17 Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king and possibly at his instigation to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception.15 In his early years Alexander was raised by a nurse Lanike sister of Alexanders future general Cleitus the Black. Later in his childhood Alexander was tutored by the strict Leonidas a relative of his mother and by Lysimachus of Acarnania.18 Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths learning to read play the lyre ride fight and hunt.19 When Alexander was ten years old a trader from Thessaly brought Philip a horse which he offered to sell for thirteen talents. The horse refused to be mounted and Philip ordered it away. Alexander however detecting the horses fear of its own shadow asked to tame the horse which he eventually managed.15 Plutarch stated that Philip overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition kissed his son tearfully declaring My boy you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. Macedon is too small for you and bought the horse for him.20 Alexander named it Bucephalas meaning oxhead. Bucephalas carried Alexander as far as India. When the animal died because of old age according to Plutarch at age 30 Alexander named a city after him Bucephala.21 Education When Alexander was 13 Philip began to search for a tutor and considered such academics as Isocrates and Speusippus the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of the Academy to take up the post. In the end Philip chose Aristotle and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at Mieza as a classroom. In return for teaching Alexander Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotles hometown of Stageira which Philip had razed and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the excitizens who were slaves or pardoning those who were in exile.22 Mieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles such as Ptolemy Hephaistion and Cassander. Many of these students would become his friends and future generals and are often known as the Companions. Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine philosophy morals religion logic and art. Under Aristotles tutelage Alexander developed a passion for the works of Homer and in particular the Iliad Aristotle gave him an annotated copy which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.23 Alexander was able to quote Euripides from memory.24 In his youth Alexander was also acquainted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court who received the protection of Philip II for several years as they opposed Artaxerxes III.252627 Among them were Artabazos II and his daughter Barsine possible future mistress of Alexander who resided at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC as well as Amminapes future satrap of Alexander or a Persian nobleman named Sisines.25282930 This gave the Macedonian court a good knowledge of Persian issues and may even have influenced some of the innovations in the management of the Macedonian state.28 Suda writes that Anaximenes of Lampsacus was one of Alexanders teachers and that Anaximenes also accompanied Alexander on his campaigns.31 Heir of Philip II Regency and ascent of Macedon Main articles Philip II of Macedon and Rise of Macedon Further information History of Macedonia ancient kingdom Philip II of Macedon Alexanders father At the age of 16 Alexanders education under Aristotle ended. Philip II had waged war against the Thracians to the north which left Alexander in charge as regent and heir apparent.15 During Philips absence the Thracian tribe of Maedi revolted against Macedonia. Alexander responded quickly and drove them from their territory. The territory was colonized and a city named Alexandropolis was founded.32 Upon Philips return Alexander was dispatched with a small force to subdue the revolts in southern Thrace. Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus Alexander reportedly saved his fathers life. Meanwhile the city of Amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to Apollo near Delphi a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. While Philip was occupied in Thrace Alexander was ordered to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil the Illyrians invaded Macedonia only to be repelled by Alexander.33 Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC and they marched south through Thermopylae taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison. They went on to occupy the city of Elatea only a few days march from both Athens and Thebes. The Athenians led by Demosthenes voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia. Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebess favour but Athens won the contest.34 Philip marched on Amphissa ostensibly acting on the request of the Amphictyonic League capturing the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes and accepting the citys surrender. Philip then returned to Elatea sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes who both rejected it.35 Battle plan from the Battle of Chaeronea As Philip marched south his opponents blocked him near Chaeronea Boeotia. During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left accompanied by a group of Philips trusted generals. According to the ancient sources the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines followed by Philips generals. Having damaged the enemys cohesion Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone they were defeated.36 After the victory at Chaeronea Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese devastating much of Laconia and ejecting the Spartans from various parts of it.37 At Corinth Philip established a Hellenic Alliance modelled on the old antiPersian alliance of the GrecoPersian Wars which included most Greek citystates except Sparta. Philip was then named Hegemon often translated as Supreme Commander of this league known by modern scholars as the League of Corinth and announced his plans to attack the Persian Empire.3839 Exile and return When Philip returned to Pella he fell in love with and married Cleopatra Eurydice in 338 BC40 the niece of his general Attalus.41 The marriage made Alexanders position as heir less secure since any son of Cleopatra Eurydice would be a fully Macedonian heir while Alexander was only halfMacedonian.42 During the wedding banquet a drunken Attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir.41 At the wedding of Cleopatra whom Philip fell in love with and married she being much too young for him her uncle Attalus in his drink desired the Macedonians would implore the gods to give them a lawful successor to the kingdom by his niece. This so irritated Alexander that throwing one of the cups at his head You villain said he what am I then a bastard Then Philip taking Attaluss part rose up and would have run his son through but by good fortune for them both either his overhasty rage or the wine he had drunk made his foot slip so that he fell down on the floor at which Alexander reproachfully insulted him See there said he the man who makes preparations to pass out of Europe into Asia overturned in passing from one seat to another. Plutarch describing the feud at Philips wedding.43 In 337 BC Alexander fled Macedon with his mother dropping her off with her brother King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona capital of the Molossians.44 He continued to Illyria44 where he sought refuge with one or more Illyrian kings perhaps with Glaucias and was treated as a guest despite having defeated them in battle a few years before.45 However it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son.44 Accordingly Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend Demaratus who mediated between the two parties.46 In the following year the Persian satrap governor of Caria Pixodarus offered his eldest daughter to Alexanders halfbrother Philip Arrhidaeus.44 Olympias and several of Alexanders friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir.44 Alexander reacted by sending an actor Thessalus of Corinth to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughters hand to an illegitimate son but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.44 Philip exiled four of Alexanders friends Harpalus Nearchus Ptolemy and Erigyius and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains.47 King of Macedon Accession Further information Government of Macedonia ancient kingdom Pausanias assassinates Philip II Alexanders father during his procession into the theatre In the summer of 336 BC while at Aegae attending the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra to Olympiass brother Alexander I of Epirus Philip was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguards Pausanias.h As Pausanias tried to escape he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers including two of Alexanders companions Perdiccas and Leonnatus. Alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and army at the age of 
20.4 84950 Consolidation of power Alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne. He had his cousin the former Amyntas IV executed.51 He also had two Macedonian princes from the region of Lyncestis killed for having been involved in his fathers assassination but spared a third Alexander Lyncestes. Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and Europa her daughter by Philip burned alive. When Alexander learned about this he was furious. Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus51 who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatras uncle.52 Attalus was at that time corresponding with Demosthenes regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander and following Cleopatras murder Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to be left alive.52 Alexander spared Arrhidaeus who was by all accounts mentally disabled possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias.485053 News of Philips death roused many states into revolt including Thebes Athens Thessaly and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon. When news of the revolts reached Alexander he responded quickly. Though advised to use diplomacy Alexander mustered 3000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly. He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa and ordered his men to ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day they found Alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered adding their cavalry to Alexanders force. He then continued south towards the Peloponnese.54 Alexander stopped at Thermopylae where he was recognized as the leader of the Amphictyonic League before heading south to Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels. The famous encounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynic occurred during Alexanders stay in Corinth. When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for him the philosopher disdainfully asked Alexander to stand a little to the side as he was blocking the sunlight.55 This reply apparently delighted Alexander who is reported to have said But verily if I were not Alexander I would like to be Diogenes.56 At Corinth Alexander took the title of Hegemon leader and like Philip was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia. He also received news of a Thracian uprising.57 Balkan campaign Main article Alexanders Balkan campaign The Macedonian phalanx at the Battle of the Carts against the Thracians in 335 BC Before crossing to Asia Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders. In the spring of 335 BC he advanced to suppress several revolts. Starting from Amphipolis he travelled east into the country of the Independent Thracians and at Mount Haemus the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights.58 The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi and defeated their army near the Lyginus river59 a tributary of the Danube. Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish.60 News then reached Alexander that the Illyrian chieftain Cleitus and King Glaukias of the Taulantii were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria Alexander defeated each in turn forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories he secured his northern frontier.61 Destruction of Thebes While Alexander campaigned north the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south.62 While the other cities again hesitated Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace.62 Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign leaving Antipater as regent.63 Conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire Main articles Wars of Alexander the Great and Chronology of the expedition of Alexander the Great into Asia Asia Minor Further information Battle of the Granicus Siege of Halicarnassus and Siege of Miletus Map of Alexanders empire and his route Alexander the Great 12

In 336 he sent Parmenion Amyntas Andromenes Attalus and an army of 10000 men into Anatolia to make preparations for an invasion.6465 The Greek cities on the western coast of Anatolia revolted until the news arrived that Philip had been murdered and had been succeeded by his young son Alexander. The Macedonians were demoralized by Philips death and were subsequently defeated near Magnesia by the Achaemenids under the command of the mercenary Memnon of Rhodes.6465 Taking over the invasion project of Philip II Alexanders army crossed the Hellespont in 334 BC with approximately 48100 soldiers 6100 cavalry and a fleet of 120 ships with crews numbering 3800062 drawn from Macedon and various Greek city states mercenaries and feudally raised soldiers from Thrace Paionia and Illyria.
66 i He showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods. This also showed Alexanders eagerness to fight in contrast to his fathers preference for diplomacy.62 After an initial victory against Persian forces at the Battle of the Granicus Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of Sardis he then proceeded along the Ionian coast granting autonomy and democracy to the cities. Miletus held by Achaemenid forces required a delicate siege operation with Persian naval forces nearby. Further south at Halicarnassus in Caria Alexander successfully waged his first largescale siege eventually forcing his opponents the mercenary captain Memnon of Rhodes and the Persian satrap of Caria Orontobates to withdraw by sea.67 Alexander left the government of Caria to a member of the Hecatomnid dynasty Ada who adopted Alexander.68 Alexander Cuts the Gordian Knot by JeanSimon Berthlemy 1767 From Halicarnassus Alexander proceeded into mountainous Lycia and the Pamphylian plain asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the Persians naval bases. From Pamphylia onwards the coast held no major ports and Alexander moved inland. At Termessos Alexander humbled and did not storm the Pisidian city.69 At the ancient Phrygian capital of Gordium Alexander undid the hitherto unsolvable Gordian Knot a feat said to await the future king of Asia.70 According to the story Alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and hacked it apart with his sword.71 The Levant and Syria Further information Battle of Issus and Siege of Tyre 332 BC In spring 333 BC Alexander crossed the Taurus into Cilicia. After a long pause due to an illness he marched on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Dariuss significantly larger army he marched back to Cilicia where he defeated Darius at Issus. Darius fled the battle causing his army to collapse and left behind his wife his two daughters his mother Sisygambis and a fabulous treasure.72 He offered a peace treaty that included the lands he had already lost and a ransom of 10000 talents for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.73 Alexander proceeded to take possession of Syria and most of the coast of the Levant.68 In the following year 332 BC he was forced to attack Tyre which he captured after a long and difficult siege.7475 The men of military age were massacred and the women and children sold into slavery.76 Egypt Further information Siege of Gaza 332 BCE Name of Alexander the Great in Egyptian hieroglyphs written from right to left c.332 BC Egypt. Louvre Museum. When Alexander destroyed Tyre most of the towns on the route to Egypt quickly capitulated. However Alexander was met with resistance at Gaza. The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill requiring a siege. When his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible... this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt.77 After three unsuccessful assaults the stronghold fell but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound. As in Tyre men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery.78 Egypt was only one of a large number of territories taken by Alexander from the Persians. After his trip to Siwa Alexander was crowned in the temple of Ptah at Memphis. It appears that the Egyptian people did not find it disturbing that he was a foreigner  nor that he was absent for virtually his entire reign.79 Alexander restored the temples neglected by the Persians and dedicated new monuments to the Egyptian gods. In the temple of Luxor near Karnak he built a chapel for the sacred barge. During his brief months in Egypt he reformed the taxation system on the Greek models and organized the military occupation of the country but in early 331 BC he left for Asia in pursuit of the Persians.79 Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC where he was regarded as a liberator.80 To legitimize taking power and be recognized as the descendant of the long line of pharaohs Alexander made sacrifices to the gods at Memphis and went to consult the famous oracle of AmunRa at the Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert79 at which he was pronounced the son of the deity Amun.81 Henceforth Alexander often referred to ZeusAmmon as his true father and after his death currency depicted him adorned with horns using the Horns of Ammon as a symbol of his divinity.82 The Greeks interpreted this message  one that the gods addressed to all pharaohs  as a prophecy.79 During his stay in Egypt he founded Alexandria which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom after his death.83 Control of Egypt passed to Ptolemy I son of Lagos the founder of the Ptolemaic Dynasty 30530 BC after the death of Alexander.84 Assyria and Babylonia Further information Battle of Gaugamela Entry of Alexander into Babylon by Charles Le Brun 1665 Leaving Egypt in 331 BC Alexander marched eastward into Achaemenid Assyria in Upper Mesopotamia now northern Iraq and defeated Darius again at the Battle of Gaugamela.85 Darius once more fled the field and Alexander chased him as far as Arbela. Gaugamela would be the final and decisive encounter between the two.86 Darius fled over the mountains to Ecbatana modern Hamadan while Alexander captured Babylon.87 Babylonian astronomical diaries say that the king of the world Alexander sent his scouts with a message to the people of Babylon before entering the city I shall not enter your houses.88 Persia Further information Battle of the Persian Gate Site of the Persian Gate in modernday Iran the road was built in the 19
90 s. From Babylon Alexander went to Susa one of the Achaemenid capitals and captured its treasury.87 He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He then stormed the pass of the Persian Gates in the modern Zagros Mountains which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.89 On entering Persepolis Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days.90 Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months.91 During his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of Xerxes I and spread to the rest of the city. Possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the Second Persian War by Xerxes92 Plutarch and Diodorus allege that Alexanders companion the hetaera Thas instigated and started the fire. Even as he watched the city burn Alexander immediately began to regret his decision.939495 Plutarch claims that he ordered his men to put out the fires93 but the flames had already spread to most of the city.93 Curtius claims that Alexander did not regret his decision until the next morning.93 Plutarch recounts an anecdote in which Alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of Xerxes as if it were a live person Shall I pass by and leave you lying there because of the expeditions you led against Greece or shall I set you up again because of your magnanimity and your virtues in other respects96 Fall of the Persian Empire and the East Administrative document from Bactria dated to the seventh year of Alexanders reign 324 BC bearing the first known use of the Alexandros form of his name Khalili Collection of Aramaic Documents97 Alexander then chased Darius first into Media and then Parthia.98 The Persian king no longer controlled his own destiny and was taken prisoner by Bessus his Bactrian satrap and kinsman.99 As Alexander approached Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Dariuss successor as Artaxerxes V before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander.100 Alexander buried Dariuss remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral.101 He claimed that while dying Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne.102 The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius.103 However as basic forms of community life and the general structure of government were maintained and resuscitated by Alexander under his own rule he in the words of the Iranologist Pierre Briant may therefore be considered to have acted in many ways as the last of the Achaemenids.104 Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him. This campaign initially against Bessus turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities all called Alexandria including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan and Alexandria Eschate The Furthest in modern Tajikistan. The campaign took Alexander through Media Parthia Aria West Afghanistan Drangiana Arachosia South and Central Afghanistan Bactria North and Central Afghanistan and Scythia.105 In 329 BC Spitamenes who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana betrayed Bessus to Ptolemy one of Alexanders trusted companions and Bessus was executed.106 However at some point later when Alexander was on the Jaxartes dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army Spitamenes raised Sogdiana in revolt. Alexander personally defeated the Scythians at the Battle of Jaxartes and immediately launched a campaign against Spitamenes defeating him in the Battle of Gabai. After the defeat Spitamenes was killed by his own men who then sued for peace.107 Problems and plots The Killing of Cleitus by Andr Castaigne 18981899 During this time Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court notably the custom of proskynesis either a symbolic kissing of the hand or prostration on the ground that Persians showed to their social superiors.108 This was one aspect of Alexanders broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the Iranian upper classes.104 The Greeks however regarded the gesture of proskynesis as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen and he eventually abandoned it.109 During the long rule of the Achaemenids the elite positions in many segments of the empire including the central government the army and the many satrapies were specifically reserved for Iranians and to a major degree Persian noblemen.104 The latter were in many cases additionally connected through marriage alliances with the royal Achaemenid family.104 This created a problem for Alexander as to whether he had to make use of the various segments and people that had given the empire its solidity and unity for a lengthy period of time.104 Pierre Briant explains that Alexander realized that it was insufficient to merely exploit the internal contradictions within the imperial system as in Asia Minor Babylonia or Egypt he also had to recreate a central government with or without the support of the Iranians.104 As early as 334 BC he demonstrated awareness of this when he challenged incumbent King Darius III by appropriating the main elements of the Achaemenid monarchys ideology particularly the theme of the king who protects the lands and the peasants.104 Alexander wrote a letter in 332 BC to Darius III wherein he argued that he was worthier than Darius to succeed to the Achaemenid throne.104 However Alexanders eventual decision to burn the Achaemenid palace at Persepolis in conjunction with the major rejection and opposition of the entire Persian people made it impracticable for him to pose himself as Darius legitimate successor.104 Against Bessus Artaxerxes V however Briant adds Alexander reasserted his claim to legitimacy as the avenger of Darius III.104 A plot against his life was revealed and one of his officers Philotas was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father and thus Parmenion who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana was assassinated at Alexanders command to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus Cleitus the Black during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and especially of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.110 Later in the Central Asian campaign a second plot against his life was revealed. This one was instigated by his own royal pages. His official historian Callisthenes of Olynthus was implicated in the plot and in the Anabasis of Alexander Arrian states that Callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment and likely died soon after.111 It remains unclear if Callisthenes was actually involved in the plot for prior to his accusation he had fallen out of favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.112 Macedon in Alexanders absence When Alexander set out for Asia he left his general Antipater an experienced military and political leader and part of Philip IIs Old Guard in charge of Macedon.63 Alexanders sacking of Thebes ensured that Greece remained quiet during his absence.63 The one exception was a call to arms by Spartan king Agis III in 331 BC whom Antipater defeated and killed in the battle of Megalopolis.63 Antipater referred the Spartans punishment to the League of Corinth which then deferred to Alexander who chose to pardon them.113 There was also considerable friction between Antipater and Olympias and each complained to Alexander about the other.114 In general Greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexanders campaign in Asia.115 Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire.116 However Alexanders constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedons strength greatly weakening it in the years after Alexander and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after the Third Macedonian War 171168 BC.19 Coinage Silver tetradrachm of Alexander the Great struck by Balakros or his successor Menes both former somatophylakes bodyguards of Alexander when they held the position of satrap of Cilicia in the lifetime of Alexander c.333327 BC. The obverse shows Heracles ancestor of the Macedonian royal line and the reverse shows a seated Zeus Atophoros.117 The conquest by Philip II of Pangaeum and then of the island of Thasos between 356 and 342 BC brought rich gold and silver mines under Macedonian control.118 Alexander appears to have introduced a new coinage in Cilicia in Tarsus after the Battle of Issus in 333 BC which went on to become the main coinage of the empire.119 Alexander minted gold staters silver tetradrachms and drachims and various fractional bronze coins. The types of these coins remained constant in his empire. The gold series had the head of Athena on the obverse and a winged Nike Victory on the reverse.120 The silver coinage had a beardless head of Heracles wearing a lionskin headdress on the obverse and Zeus aetophoros eagle bearer enthroned with a scepter in his left hand on the reverse.121 There are both Greek and nonGreek aspects to this design. Heracles and Zeus were important deities for the Macedonians with Heracles considered to be the ancestor of the Temenid dynasty and Zeus the patron of the main Macedonian sanctuary Dium.119 The lion was also the symbolic animal of the Anatolian god Sandas worshipped at Tarsus.119 The reverse design of Alexanders tetradrachms is closely modelled on the depiction of the god Baaltars Baal of Tarsus on the silver staters minted at Tarsus by the Persian satrap Mazaeus before Alexanders conquest.119 Alexander did not attempt to impose uniform imperial coinage throughout his new conquests. Persian coins continued to circulate in all the satrapies of the empire.122 Indian campaign Main article Indian campaign of Alexander the Great Forays into the Indian subcontinent Alexanders invasion of the Indian subcontinent After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana Raoxshna in Old Iranian to cement relations with his new satrapies Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent. He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara a region presently straddling eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis Indian name Ambhi the ruler of Taxila whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes Jhelum complied but the chieftains of some hill clans including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas refused to submit.123 Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of Persian robes gold and silver ornaments 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold. Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund124 supplied their troops with provisions and he received Alexander and his whole army in his capital city of Taxila with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. The Phalanx Attacking the Centre in the Battle of the Hydaspes by Andr Castaigne 18981899 On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the Battle of the Hydaspes. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander Taxiles contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes and was entrusted by Alexander with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip son of Machatas and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself 323 BC as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus 321 BC. In the winter of 327326 BC Alexander personally led a campaign against the Aspasioi of the Kunar Valley the Guraeans of the Guraeus Valley and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner Valleys.125 A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi who fought against him from the strongholds of Massaga Ora and Aornos.123 The fort of Massaga was reduced after days of bloody fighting in which Alexander was seriously wounded in the ankle. According to Curtius Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble.126 A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hillfort after four bloody days.123 Porus surrenders to Alexander After Aornos Alexander crossed the Indus and won an epic battle against King Porus who ruled a region lying between the Hydaspes and the Acesines Chenab in what is now the Punjab in the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC.127 Alexander was impressed by Poruss bravery and made him an ally. He appointed Porus as satrap and added to Poruss territory land that he did not previously own towards the southeast up to the Hyphasis Beas.128129 Choosing a local helped him control these lands that were distant from Greece.130 Alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the Hydaspes river naming one Bucephala in honour of his horse who died around this time.131 The other was Nicaea Victory thought to be located at the site of modernday Mong Punjab.132 Philostratus the Elder in the Life of Apollonius of Tyana writes that in the army of Porus there was an elephant who fought bravely against Alexanders army and Alexander dedicated it to the Helios Sun and named it Ajax because he thought that such a great animal deserved a great name. The elephant had gold rings around its tusks and an inscription was on them written in Greek Alexander the son of Zeus dedicates Ajax to the Helios       .133 Revolt of the Hellenic army Asia in 323 BC the Nanda Empire and the Gangaridai of the Indian subcontinent in relation to Alexanders Empire and neighbours East of Poruss kingdom near the Ganges River was the Nanda Empire of Magadha and further east the Gangaridai Empire of Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent. Fearing the prospect of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning Alexanders army mutinied at the Hyphasis River Beas refusing to march farther east.134 This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexanders conquests.135 As for the Macedonians however their struggle with Porus blunted their courage and stayed their further advance into India. For having had all they could do to repulse an enemy who mustered only twenty thousand infantry and two thousand horse they violently opposed Alexander when he insisted on crossing the river Ganges also the width of which as they learned was thirtytwo furlongs 
6.4  km its depth one hundred fathoms 180 m while its banks on the further side were covered with multitudes of menatarms and horsemen and elephants. For they were told that the kings of the Ganderites and Praesii were awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen two hundred thousand footmen eight thousand chariots and six thousand war elephants.136 Alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther but his general Coenus pleaded with him to change his opinion and return the men he said longed to again see their parents their wives and children their homeland. Alexander eventually agreed and turned south marching along the Indus. Along the way his army conquered the Malhi in modernday Multan and other Indian tribes while besieging the Mallian citadel Alexander suffered a nearfatal injury when an arrow penetrated his armor and entered his lung.137138 Alexander sent much of his army to Carmania modern southern Iran with general Craterus and commissioned a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore under his admiral Nearchus while he led the rest back to Persia through the more difficult southern route along the Gedrosian Desert and Makran.139 Alexander reached Susa in 324 BC but not before losing many men to the harsh desert.140 Last years in Persia Stag Hunt Mosaic the figure on the right possibly being Alexander and the figure to the left wields a doubleheaded axe likely alluding to Hephaistos possibly meaning his general Hephaestion Discovering that many of his satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his absence Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to Susa.141142 As a gesture of thanks he paid off the debts of his soldiers and announced that he would send overaged and disabled veterans back to Macedon led by Craterus. His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of Opis. They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units.143 After three days unable to persuade his men to back down Alexander gave Persians command posts in the army and conferred Macedonian military titles upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness which Alexander accepted and held a great banquet with several thousand of his men.144 In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects Alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year.142 Alexander at the Tomb of Cyrus the Great by PierreHenri de Valenciennes 1796 Meanwhile upon his return to Persia Alexander learned that guards of the tomb of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae had desecrated it and swiftly executed them.145 Alexander admired Cyrus the Great from an early age reading Xenophons Cyropaedia which described Cyruss heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator.146 During his visit to Pasargadae Alexander ordered his architect Aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of Cyruss tomb.146 Afterwards Alexander travelled to Ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the Persian treasure. There his closest friend Hephaestion died of illness or poisoning.147 Hephaestions death devastated Alexander and he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral pyre in Babylon along with a decree for public mourning.147 Back in Babylon Alexander planned a series of new campaigns beginning with an invasion of Arabia but he would not have a chance to realize them as he died shortly after Hephaestion.148 Busts of Alexander the Great and his general Hephaestion at the Getty Villa in the Pacific Palisades CA On the evening of May 29 Alexander organized a banquet for his army to celebrate the end of the campaign of India and the onset of the invasion of the Arabian Peninsula. There is a tradition that they would only start serious drinking after everyone was done with their meals but the wine was usually heavily watered.149 Death and succession Main article Death of Alexander the Great A Babylonian astronomical diary c. 323322 BC recording the death of Alexander British Museum London Before his death someone asked Alexander on who would be his designated successor should he die he responded To the strongest one. He may have also added that there would be funeral games to be played after his death.150151 On either 10 or 11 June 323 BC Alexander died in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II in Babylon at age 
32.1 52 There are two different versions of Alexanders death differing slightly in details. Plutarchs account is that roughly 14 days before his death Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa.153 Alexander developed a fever which worsened until he was unable to speak. The common soldiers anxious about his health were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them.154 In the second account Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles followed by 11 days of weakness he did not develop a fever instead dying after some agony.155 Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.153 Given the propensity of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination156 foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death. Diodorus Plutarch Arrian and Justin all mentioned the theory that Alexander was poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication157 while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness.155158 The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater recently removed as Macedonian viceroy replaced by Craterus as the head of the alleged plot.159 Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence160 and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas161 Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas who was Alexanders winepourer.158161 There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.158 The strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death such longacting poisons were probably not available.162 However in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating the death of Alexander Leo Schep from the New Zealand National Poisons Centre proposed that the plant white hellebore Veratrum album which was known in antiquity may have been used to poison Alexander.163164165 In a 2014 manuscript in the journal Clinical Toxicology Schep suggested Alexanders wine was spiked with Veratrum album and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the Alexander Romance.166 Veratrum album poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if Alexander was poisoned Veratrum album offers the most plausible cause.166167 Another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river Styx modernday Mavroneri in Arcadia Greece that contained calicheamicin a dangerous compound produced by bacteria.168 Several natural causes diseases have been suggested including malaria and typhoid fever. A 1998 article in the New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis.169 A 2004 analysis suggested pyogenic infectious spondylitis or meningitis.170 Other illnesses fit the symptoms including acute pancreatitis West Nile virus171172 and GuillainBarr syndrome.173 Naturalcause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexanders health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestions death may also have contributed to his declining health.169 Postdeath events See also Tomb of Alexander the Great Alexanders body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey which was in turn placed in a gold casket.174175 According to Aelian a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest would be happy and unvanquishable forever.176 Perhaps more likely the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative.177 
19 thcentury depiction of Alexanders funeral procession based on the description by Diodorus Siculus While Alexanders funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis.174176 His successor Ptolemy II Philadelphus transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria where it remained until at least late Antiquity. Ptolemy IX Lathyros one of Ptolemys final successors replaced Alexanders sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage.178 The 2014 discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece at Amphipolis dating from the time of Alexander the Great179 has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexanders funeral cortege. However the memorial was found to be dedicated to the dearest friend of Alexander the Great Hephaestion.180181 Detail of Alexander on the Alexander Sarcophagus Pompey Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited the tomb in Alexandria where Augustus allegedly accidentally knocked the nose off. Caligula was said to have taken Alexanders breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD 200 Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexanders tomb to the public. His son and successor Caracalla a great admirer visited the tomb during his own reign. After this details on the fate of the tomb are hazy.178 The socalled Alexander Sarcophagus discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexanders remains but because its basreliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus died 311 BC the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the battle of Issus in 3
31.1 82183 However in 1969 it was suggested by Karl Schefold that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymuss death.184 Demades likened the Macedonian army after the death of Alexander to the blinded Cyclops due to the many random and disorderly movements that it made.185186187 In addition Leosthenes also likened the anarchy between the generals after Alexanders death to the blinded Cyclops who after he had lost his eye went feeling and groping about with his hands before him not knowing where to lay them.188 Division of the Macedonian Empire Main articles Partition of Babylon and Diadochi Kingdoms of the Diadochi in 301 BC the Ptolemaic Kingdom dark blue the Seleucid Empire yellow Kingdom of Lysimachus orange and Kingdom of Macedon green. Also shown are the Roman Republic light blue the Carthaginian Republic purple and the Kingdom of Epirus red. Alexanders death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached Greece they were not immediately believed.63 Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexanders death.189 According to Diodorus Alexanders companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom his laconic reply was ti kratistito the strongest.155 Another theory is that his successors wilfully or erroneously misheard ti Kraterito Craterus the general leading his Macedonian troops home and newly entrusted with the regency of Macedonia.190 Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this time implying that this was an apocryphal story.191 Diodorus Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry in front of witnesses thereby nominating him.155189 Perdiccas initially did not claim power instead suggesting that Roxanes baby would be king if male with himself Craterus Leonnatus and Antipater as guardians. However the infantry under the command of Meleager rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead they supported Alexanders halfbrother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually the two sides reconciled and after the birth of Alexander IV he and Philip III were appointed joint kings albeit in name only.192 Dissension and rivalry soon affected the Macedonians. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC Macedonian unity collapsed and 40 years of war between The Successors Diadochi ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into three stable power blocs Ptolemaic Egypt Seleucid Syria and East and Antigonid Macedonia. In the process both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered.193 Last plans Diodorus stated that Alexander had given detailed written instructions to Craterus some time before his death which are known as Alexanders last plans.194 Craterus started to carry out Alexanders commands but the successors chose not to further implement them on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant.194 Furthermore Perdiccas had read the notebooks containing Alexanders last plans to the Macedonian troops in Babylon who voted not to carry them out.63 According to Diodorus Alexanders last plans called for military expansion into the southern and western Mediterranean monumental constructions and the intermixing of Eastern and Western populations. It included Construction of 1000 ships larger than triremes along with harbours and a road running along the African coast all the way to the Pillars of Hercules to be used for an invasion of Carthage and the western Mediterranean195 Erection of great temples in Delos Delphi Dodona Dium Amphipolis all costing 1500 talents and a monumental temple to Athena at Troy63195 Amalgamation of small settlements into larger cities synoecisms and the transplant of populations from Asia to Europe and in the opposite direction from Europe to Asia in order to bring the largest continent to common unity and to friendship by means of intermarriage and family ties196195 Construction of a monumental tomb for his father Philip to match the greatest of the pyramids of Egypt63195 Conquest of Arabia63 Circumnavigation of Africa63 The enormous scale of these plans has led many scholars to doubt their historicity. Ernst Badian argued that they were exaggerated by Perdiccas in order to ensure that the Macedonian troops voted not to carry them out.195 Other scholars have proposed that they were invented by later authors within the tradition of the Alexander Romance.197 Character Generalship Further information Military tactics of Alexander the Great Alexander perhaps earned the epithet the Great due to his unparalleled success as a military commander he never lost a battle despite typically being outnumbered.198 This was due to use of terrain phalanx and cavalry tactics bold strategy and the fierce loyalty of his troops.199 The Macedonian phalanx armed with the sarissa a spear 6 metres 20 ft long had been developed and perfected by Philip II through rigorous training and Alexander used its speed and manoeuvrability to great effect against larger but more disparate Persian forces.200 Alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army which employed various languages and weapons. He overcame this by being personally involved in battle91 in the manner of a Macedonian king.199 The Battle of the Granicus 334 BC In his first battle in Asia at Granicus Alexander used only a small part of his forces perhaps 13000 infantry with 5000 cavalry against a much larger Persian force of 400
00.2 01 Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line about 3 km 
1.8 6 mi. By contrast the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry. This ensured that Alexander would not be outflanked while his phalanx armed with long pikes had a considerable advantage over the Persians scimitars and javelins. Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians.202 The Battle of Issus 333 BC At Issus in 333 BC his first confrontation with Darius he used the same deployment and again the central phalanx pushed through.202 Alexander personally led the charge in the center routing the opposing army.203 At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx with the center advancing at an angle parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Dariuss center causing the latter to flee once again.202 When faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques such as in Central Asia and India Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents style. Thus in Bactria and Sogdiana Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements while massing his cavalry at the center.203 In India confronted by Poruss elephant corps the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants handlers.144 Physical appearance Alexander cameo by Pyrgoteles Historical sources frequently give conflicting accounts of Alexanders appearance and the earliest sources are the most scant in their detail.204 During his lifetime Alexander carefully curated his image by commissioning works from famous and great artists of the time. This included commissioning sculptures by Lysippos paintings by Apelles and gem engravings by Pyrgoteles.205 Ancient authors recorded that Alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by Lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image scholars today however find the claim dubious.206205 Nevertheless Andrew Stewart highlights the fact that artistic portraits not least because of who they are commissioned by are always partisan and that artistic portrayals of Alexander seek to legitimize him or by extension his Successors to interpret him to their audiences to answer their critiques and to persuade them of his greatness and thus should be considered within a framework of praise and blame in the same way sources such as praise poetry are.207 Despite those caveats Lysipposs sculpture famous for its naturalism as opposed to a stiffer more static pose is thought to be the most faithful depiction.208 Curtius Rufus a Roman historian from the first century AD who wrote the Histories of Alexander the Great gives this account of Alexander sitting on the throne of Darius III Then Alexander seating himself on the royal throne which was far too high for his bodily stature. Therefore since his feet did not reach its lowest step one of the royal pages placed a table under his feet.209 Both Curtius and Diodorus report a story that when Darius IIIs mother Sisygambis first met Alexander and Hephaestion she assumed that the latter was Alexander because he was the taller and more handsome of the two.210 Alexander sculpture by Lysippos 
4 th century BC The Greek biographer Plutarch c.45  c.120 AD discusses the accuracy of his depictions The outward appearance of Alexander is best represented by the statues of him which Lysippus made and it was by this artist alone that Alexander himself thought it fit that he should be modelled. For those peculiarities which many of his successors and friends afterwards tried to imitate namely the poise of the neck which was bent slightly to the left and the melting glance of his eyes this artist has accurately observed. Apelles however in painting him as wielder of the thunderbolt did not reproduce his complexion but made it too dark and swarthy. Whereas he was of a fair colour as they say and his fairness passed into ruddiness on his breast particularly and in his face. Moreover that a very pleasant odour exhaled from his skin and that there was a fragrance about his mouth and all his flesh so that his garments were filled with it this we have read in the Memoirs of Aristoxenus.211 Historians have understood the detail of the pleasant fragrance attributed to Alexander as stemming from a belief in ancient Greece that pleasant scents are characteristic of gods and heroes.205 A fresco depicting a hunt scene at the tomb of Philip II at Aigai the only known painting of Alexander made during his lifetime 3
30 s BC The Alexander Mosaic and contemporary coins portray Alexander with a straight nose a slightly protruding jaw full lips and eyes deep set beneath a strongly pronounced forehead.205 He is also described as having a slight upward tilt of his head to the left.212 The ancient historian Aelian c.175  c.235 AD in his Varia Historia 
12.1 4 describes Alexanders hair color as  xanthn which at the time could mean yellowish brownish or reddish.213214215 It is sometimes claimed that Alexander had one blue and one brown eye216 referring to the Alexander Romance which is however a fictional account that also claims Alexander had sharp teeth like fangs and did not look like Philip or Olympias. Reconstruction based on remaining traces of paint of the original polychromy on his sarcophagus indicates that he was depicted with brown eyes and chestnut brown hair.217 Personality Alexander left wearing a kausia and fighting an Asiatic lion with his friend Craterus detail late 
4 th century BC mosaic218 Pella Museum Both of Alexanders parents encouraged his ambitions. His father Philip was probably Alexanders most immediate and influential role model as the young Alexander watched him campaign practically every year winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds.51 Alexanders relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality he had a need to outdo his father illustrated by his reckless behavior in battle.219 While Alexander worried that his father would leave him no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world220 he also downplayed his fathers achievements to his companions.219 Alexanders mother Olympia similarly had huge ambitions and encouraged her son to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire.219 She instilled a sense of destiny in him221 and Plutarch tells how his ambition kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years.222 According to Plutarch Alexander also had a violent temper and rash impulsive nature223 which could influence his decision making.219 Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father he was open to reasoned debate.224 He had a calmer sideperceptive logical and calculating. He had a great desire for knowledge a love for philosophy and was an avid reader.225 This was no doubt in part due to Aristotles tutelage Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn.219 His intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general.223 He had great selfrestraint in pleasures of the body in contrast with his lack of selfcontrol with alcohol.226 A Roman copy of an original 
3 rd century BC Greek bust depicting Alexander the Great Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek Copenhagen Alexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences.222225 However he had little interest in sports or the Olympic Games unlike his father seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour tim and glory kudos.227 He had great charisma and force of personality characteristics which made him a great leader.189223 His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his deathonly Alexander had the ability to do so.189 During his final years and especially after the death of Hephaestion Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia.160 His extraordinary achievements coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions may have combined to produce this effect.228 His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world160 in as much as he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition229230 an epithet the meaning of which has descended into a historical clich.231232 He appears to have believed himself a deity or at least sought to deify himself.160 Olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of Zeus233 a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa.234 He began to identify himself as the son of ZeusAmmon.234 Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court notably proskynesis which was one aspect of Alexanders broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the Iranian upper classes104 however the practise of proskynesis was disapproved by the Macedonians and they were unwilling to perform it.108 This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen.235 Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples many of whom lived in societies where the king was treated as divine.236 Thus rather than megalomania his behaviour may have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.237 Personal relationships Main article Personal relationships of Alexander the Great A mural in Pompeii depicting the marriage of Alexander to Stateira in 324 BC the couple is apparently dressed as Ares and Aphrodite. Alexander married three times Roxana daughter of the Sogdian nobleman Oxyartes of Bactria238239240 out of love241 and the Persian princesses Stateira and Parysatis the former a daughter of Darius III and the latter a daughter of Artaxerxes III for political reasons.242243 He apparently had two sons Alexander IV of Macedon by Roxana and possibly Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon.244245 Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend general and bodyguard Hephaestion the son of a Macedonian noble.147219246 Hephaestions death devastated Alexander.147247 This event may have contributed to Alexanders failing health and detached mental state during his final months.160169 Sexuality Alexanders sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy in modern times.248 The Roman era writer Athenaeus says based on the scholar Dicaearchus who was Alexanders contemporary that the king was quite excessively keen on boys and that Alexander kissed the eunuch Bagoas in public.249 This episode is also told by Plutarch probably based on the same source. None of Alexanders contemporaries however are known to have explicitly described Alexanders relationship with Hephaestion as sexual though the pair was often compared to Achilles and Patroclus who are often interpreted as a couple. Aelian writes of Alexanders visit to Troy where Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of Patroclus the latter hinting that he was a beloved of Alexander in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles.250 Some modern historians e.g. Robin Lane Fox believe not only that Alexanders youthful relationship with Hephaestion was sexual but also that their sexual contacts may have continued into adulthood which went against the social norms of at least some Greek cities such as Athens251252 though some modern researchers have tentatively proposed that Macedonia or at least the Macedonian court may have been more tolerant of homosexuality between adults.253 Peter Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life.219 However Ogden calculates that Alexander who impregnated his partners thrice in eight years had a higher matrimonial record than his father at the same age.254 Two of these pregnanciesStateiras and Barsinesare of dubious legitimacy.255 According to Diodorus Siculus Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings but he used it rather sparingly not wishing to offend the Macedonians256 showing great selfcontrol in pleasures of the body.226 Nevertheless Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her.257 Green suggested that in the context of the period Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women including Ada of Caria who adopted him and even Dariuss mother Sisygambis who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexanders death.219 Battle record Outcome Date War Action Opponents Type Country present day Rank Victory 3380802 2 August 338 BC Philip IIs submission of Greece Chaeronea Battle of Chaeronea .Thebans Athenians and other Greek cities Battle Greece Prince  Victory 335 335 BC Balkan Campaign Mount Haemus Battle of Mount Haemus .Getae Thracians Battle Bulgaria King  Victory 33512 December 335 BC Balkan Campaign Pelium Siege of Pelium .Illyrians Siege Albania King  Victory 33512 December 335 BC Balkan Campaign Pelium Battle of Thebes .Thebans Battle Greece King  Victory 33405 May 334 BC Persian Campaign Granicus Battle of the Granicus .Achaemenid Empire Battle Turkey King  Victory 334 334 BC Persian Campaign Miletus Siege of Miletus .Achaemenid Empire Milesians Siege Turkey King  Victory 334 334 BC Persian Campaign Halicarnassus Siege of Halicarnassus .Achaemenid Empire Siege Turkey King  Victory 3331105 5 November 333 BC Persian Campaign Issus Battle of Issus .Achaemenid Empire Battle Turkey King  Victory 332 JanuaryJuly 332 BC Persian Campaign Tyre Siege of Tyre .Achaemenid Empire Tyrians Siege Lebanon King  Victory 33210 October 332 BC Persian Campaign Tyre Siege of Gaza .Achaemenid Empire Siege Palestine King  Victory 3311001 1 October 331 BC Persian Campaign Gaugamela Battle of Gaugamela .Achaemenid Empire Battle Iraq King  Victory 33112 December 331 BC Persian Campaign Uxian Defile Battle of the Uxian Defile .Uxians Battle Iran King  Victory 3300120 20 January 330 BC Persian Campaign Persian Gate Battle of the Persian Gate .Achaemenid Empire Battle Iran King  Victory 329 329 BC Persian Campaign Cyropolis Siege of Cyropolis .Sogdians Siege Turkmenistan King  Victory 32910 October 329 BC Persian Campaign Jaxartes Battle of Jaxartes .Scythians Battle Uzbekistan King  Victory 327 327 BC Persian Campaign Sogdian Rock Siege of the Sogdian Rock .Sogdians Siege Uzbekistan King  Victory 327 May 327  March 326 BC Indian Campaign Cophen Cophen campaign .Aspasians Expedition Afghanistan and Pakistan King  Victory 32604 April 326 BC Indian Campaign Aornos Siege of Aornos .Avaka Siege Pakistan King  Victory 32605 May 326 BC Indian Campaign Hydaspes Battle of the Hydaspes .Porus Battle Pakistan King  Victory 325 November 326  February 325 BC Indian Campaign Aornos Siege of Multan .Malli Siege Pakistan King  Legacy Alexanders legacy extended beyond his military conquests and his reign marked a turning point in European and Asian history.258 His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West and vast areas to the east were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence.19 Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers many surviving into the 
21 st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched while the Greeks themselves got a sense of belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean.19 Hellenistic kingdoms Main article Hellenistic period The Hellenistic world view world map of Eratosthenes 276194 BC using information from the campaigns of Alexander and his successors259 Alexanders most immediate legacy was the introduction of Macedonian rule to huge new swathes of Asia. At the time of his death Alexanders empire covered some 5200000 km2 2000000 sq mi260 and was the largest state of its time. Many of these areas remained in Macedonian hands or under Greek influence for the next 200300 years. The successor states that emerged were at least initially dominant forces and these 300 years are often referred to as the Hellenistic period.261 The eastern borders of Alexanders empire began to collapse even during his lifetime.189 However the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful Indian dynasties in history the Maurya Empire. Taking advantage of this power vacuum Chandragupta Maurya referred to in Greek sources as Sandrokottos of relatively humble origin took control of the Punjab and with that power base proceeded to conquer the Nanda Empire.262 Founding of cities Main article List of cities founded by Alexander the Great Plan of Alexandria c.30 BC Over the course of his conquests Alexander founded many cities that bore his name most of them east of the Tigris.109263 The first and greatest was Alexandria in Egypt which would become one of the leading Mediterranean cities.109 The cities locations reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions. At first the cities must have been inhospitable little more than defensive garrisons.109 Following Alexanders death many Greeks who had settled there tried to return to Greece.109263 However a century or so after Alexanders death many of the Alexandrias were thriving with elaborate public buildings and substantial populations that included both Greek and local peoples.109 Funding of temples Dedication of Alexander the Great to Athena Polias at Priene now housed in the British Museum264 In 334 BC Alexander the Great donated funds for the completion of the new temple of Athena Polias in Priene in modernday western Turkey.265 An inscription from the temple now housed in the British Museum declares King Alexander dedicated this temple to Athena Polias.264 This inscription is one of the few independent archaeological discoveries confirming an episode from Alexanders life.264 The temple was designed by Pytheos one of the architects of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus.264265266 Libanius wrote that Alexander founded the temple of Zeus Bottiaios Ancient Greek   in the place where later the city of Antioch was built.267268 Suda wrote that Alexander built a big temple to Sarapis.269 In 2023 British Museum experts have suggested the possibility that a Greek temple at Girsu in Iraq was founded by Alexander. According to the researchers recent discoveries suggest that this site honours Zeus and two divine sons. The sons are Heracles and Alexander.270 Hellenization Main article Hellenization Alexanders empire was the largest state of its time covering approximately 
5.2  million square km. Hellenization was coined by the German historian Johann Gustav Droysen to denote the spread of Greek language culture and population into the former Persian empire after Alexanders conquest.261 This process can be seen in such great Hellenistic cities as Alexandria Antioch271 and Seleucia south of modern Baghdad.272 Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into Persian culture and to hybridize Greek and Persian culture homogenizing the populations of Asia and Europe. Although his successors explicitly rejected such policies Hellenization occurred throughout the region accompanied by a distinct and opposite Orientalization of the successor states.273 The core of the Hellenistic culture promulgated by the conquests was essentially Athenian.274 The close association of men from across Greece in Alexanders army directly led to the emergence of the largely Atticbased koine or common Greek dialect.275 Koine spread throughout the Hellenistic world becoming the lingua franca of Hellenistic lands and eventually the ancestor of modern Greek.275 Furthermore town planning education local government and art current in the Hellenistic period were all based on Classical Greek ideals evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as Hellenistic. Also the New Testament was written in the Koine Greek language.271 Aspects of Hellenistic culture were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid
15 th century.276 Hellenization in South and Central Asia Main articles IndoGreek Kingdom IndoGreek art and GrecoBuddhism The Buddha in GrecoBuddhist style 
1 st to 
2 nd century AD Gandhara northern Pakistan. Tokyo National Museum. Some of the most pronounced effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India in the region of the relatively laterising GrecoBactrian Kingdom 250125 BC in modern Afghanistan Pakistan and Tajikistan and the IndoGreek Kingdom 180 BC  10 AD in modern Afghanistan and India.277 On the Silk Road trade routes Hellenistic culture hybridized with Iranian and Buddhist cultures. The cosmopolitan art and mythology of Gandhara a region spanning the upper confluence of the Indus Swat and Kabul rivers in modern Pakistan of the 
3 rd century BC to the 
5 th century AD are most evident of the direct contact between Hellenistic civilization and South Asia as are the Edicts of Ashoka which directly mention the Greeks within Ashokas dominion as converting to Buddhism and the reception of Buddhist emissaries by Ashokas contemporaries in the Hellenistic world.278 The resulting syncretism known as GrecoBuddhism influenced the development of Buddhism279 and created a culture of GrecoBuddhist art. These GrecoBuddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China Sri Lanka and Hellenistic Asia and Europe GrecoBuddhist monasticism. Some of the first and most influential figurative portrayals of The Buddha appeared at this time perhaps modelled on Greek statues of Apollo in the GrecoBuddhist style.280 Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes281 and some Mahayana ceremonial practices burning incense gifts of flowers and food placed on altars are similar to those practised by the ancient Greeks however similar practices were also observed amongst the native Indic culture. One Greek king Menander I probably became Buddhist and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as Milinda.280 The process of Hellenization also spurred trade between the east and west.282 For example Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 
3 rd century BC were found in the GrecoBactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modernday Afghanistan283 while the Greek concept of a spherical Earth surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the longstanding Indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain Mount Meru like the petals of a flower.282284285 The Yavanajataka lit. Greek astronomical treatise and Paulisa Siddhanta texts depict the influence of Greek astronomical ideas on Indian astronomy. Following the conquests of Alexander the Great in the east Hellenistic influence on Indian art was farreaching. In architecture a few examples of the Ionic order can be found as far as Pakistan with the Jandial temple near Taxila. Several examples of capitals displaying Ionic influences can be seen as far as Patna especially with the Pataliputra capital dated to the 
3 rd century BC.286 The Corinthian order is also heavily represented in the art of Gandhara especially through IndoCorinthian capitals. Influence on Rome This medallion was produced in Imperial Rome demonstrating the influence of Alexanders memory. Walters Art Museum Baltimore. Alexander and his exploits were admired by many Romans especially generals who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements.287 Polybius began his Histories by reminding Romans of Alexanders achievements and thereafter Roman leaders saw him as a role model. Pompey the Great adopted the epithet Magnus and even Alexanders anastoletype haircut and searched the conquered lands of the east for Alexanders 2
60 yearold cloak which he then wore as a sign of greatness.287 Julius Caesar dedicated a Lysippean equestrian bronze statue but replaced Alexanders head with his own while Octavian visited Alexanders tomb in Alexandria and temporarily changed his seal from a sphinx to Alexanders profile.287 The emperor Trajan also admired Alexander as did Nero and Caracalla.287 The Macriani a Roman family that in the person of Macrinus briefly ascended to the imperial throne kept images of Alexander on their persons either on jewellery or embroidered into their clothes.288 On the other hand some Roman writers particularly Republican figures used Alexander as a cautionary tale of how autocratic tendencies can be kept in check by republican values.289 Alexander was used by these writers as an example of ruler values such as amicitia friendship and clementia clemency but also iracundia anger and cupiditas gloriae overdesire for glory.289 Emperor Julian in his satire called The Caesars describes a contest between the previous Roman emperors with Alexander the Great called in as an extra contestant in the presence of the assembled gods.290 The Itinerarium Alexandri is a 
4 thcentury Latin description of Alexander the Greats campaigns. Julius Caesar went to serve his quaestorship in Hispania after his wifes funeral in the spring or early summer of 69 BC. While there he encountered a statue of Alexander the Great and realised with dissatisfaction that he was now at an age when Alexander had the world at his feet while he had achieved comparatively little.291292 Pompey posed as the new Alexander since he was his boyhood hero.293 After Caracalla concluded his campaign against the Alamanni it became evident that he was inordinately preoccupied with Alexander the Great.294295 He began openly mimicking Alexander in his personal style. In planning his invasion of the Parthian Empire Caracalla decided to arrange 16000 of his men in Macedonianstyle phalanxes despite the Roman army having made the phalanx an obsolete tactical formation.294295296 The historian Christopher Matthew mentions that the term Phalangarii has two possible meanings both with military connotations. The first refers merely to the Roman battle line and does not specifically mean that the men were armed with pikes and the second bears similarity to the Marian Mules of the late Roman Republic who carried their equipment suspended from a long pole which were in use until at least the 
2 nd century AD.296 As a consequence the Phalangarii of Legio II Parthica may not have been pikemen but rather standard battle line troops or possibly Triarii.296 Caracallas mania for Alexander went so far that Caracalla visited Alexandria while preparing for his Persian invasion and persecuted philosophers of the Aristotelian school based on a legend that Aristotle had poisoned Alexander. This was a sign of Caracallas increasingly erratic behaviour. But this mania for Alexander strange as it was was overshadowed by subsequent events in Alexandria.295 In 39 Caligula performed a spectacular stunt by ordering a temporary floating bridge to be built using ships as pontoons stretching for over two miles from the resort of Baiae to the neighbouring port of Puteoli.297298 It was said that the bridge was to rival the Persian king Xerxes pontoon bridge crossing of the Hellespont.298 Caligula who could not swim299 then proceeded to ride his favourite horse Incitatus across wearing the breastplate of Alexander the Great.298 This act was in defiance of a prediction by Tiberiuss soothsayer Thrasyllus of Mendes that Caligula had no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the Bay of Baiae.298 The diffusion of Greek culture and language cemented by Alexanders conquests in West Asia and North Africa served as a precondition for the later Roman expansion into these territories and entire basis for the Byzantine Empire according to Errington.300 Letters Main article Letters of Alexander the Great Alexander wrote and received numerous letters but no originals survive. A few official letters addressed to the Greek cities survive in copies inscribed in stone and the content of others is sometimes reported in historical sources. These only occasionally quote the letters and it is an open question how reliable such quotations are. Several fictitious letters some perhaps based on actual letters made their way into the Romance tradition.301 In legend Main article Alexander the Great in legend Alexander in a 
14 thcentury Armenian manuscript Many of the legends about Alexander derive from his own lifetime probably encouraged by Alexander himself.302 His court historian Callisthenes portrayed the sea in Cilicia as drawing back from him in proskynesis. Writing shortly after Alexanders death Onesicritus invented a tryst between Alexander and Thalestris queen of the mythical Amazons. He reportedly read this passage to his patron King Lysimachus who had been one of Alexanders generals and who quipped I wonder where I was at the time.303 In the first centuries after Alexanders death probably in Alexandria a quantity of the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the Alexander Romance later falsely ascribed to Callisthenes and therefore known as PseudoCallisthenes. This text underwent over one hundred recensions translations and derivations throughout the Islamic and European worlds in premodern times304 containing many dubious stories302 and was translated into twentyfive languages305 for example Middle Persian Syriac and Arabic.306307 In ancient and modern culture Main articles Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great Alexander the Great in Islamic tradition and Alexander the Great in the Quran Alexander in a 
14 thcentury Byzantine manuscript Alexander the Greats accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures. Alexander has featured in both high and popular culture beginning from his own era to the present day. The Alexander Romance in particular has had a significant impact on portrayals of Alexander in later cultures from Persian to medieval European to modern Greek.305 Alexander features prominently in modern Greek folklore more than any other ancient figure.308 The colloquial form of his name in modern Greek O Megalexandros is a household name and he is the only ancient hero to appear in the Karagiozis shadow play.308 One wellknown fable among Greek seamen involves a solitary mermaid who would grasp a ships prow during a storm and ask the captain Is King Alexander alive The answer should be He is alive and well and rules the world causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm. Any other answer would cause the mermaid to turn into a raging Gorgon who would drag the ship to the bottom of the sea all hands aboard.308 Folio from the Shahnameh showing Alexander praying at the Kaaba mid
16 th century In preIslamic Middle Persian Zoroastrian literature Alexander is referred to by the epithet gujastak meaning accursed and is accused of destroying temples and burning the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism.309 In Islamic Persia under the influence of the Alexander Romance in Persian  Iskandarnameh a more positive portrayal of Alexander emerges.310 Firdausis Shahnameh The Book of Kings includes Alexander in a line of legitimate Persian shahs a mythical figure who explored the far reaches of the world in search of the Fountain of Youth.311 In the Shahnameh Alexanders first journey is to Mecca to pray at the Kaaba.312 Alexander was depicted as performing a Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca many times in subsequent Islamic art and literature.313 Later Persian writers associate him with philosophy portraying him at a symposium with figures such as Socrates Plato and Aristotle in search of immortality.310 Detail of a 
16 thcentury Islamic painting depicting Alexander being lowered in a glass submersible The figure of Dhu alQarnayn Arabic   lit. The TwoHorned One is believed by the majority of modern researchers of the Quran as well as Islamic commentators to be a reference to Alexander.314 The figure is also believed by scholars to be based on later legends of Alexander.310 In this tradition he was a heroic figure who built a wall to defend against the nations of Gog and Magog.315 He also travelled the known world in search of the Water of Life and Immortality eventually becoming a prophet.315 The Syriac version of the Alexander Romance portrays him as an ideal Christian world conqueror who prayed to the one true God.310 In Egypt Alexander was portrayed as the son of Nectanebo II the last pharaoh before the Persian conquest.315 His defeat of Darius was depicted as Egypts salvation proving Egypt was still ruled by an Egyptian.310 According to Josephus Alexander was shown the Book of Daniel when he entered Jerusalem which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire. This is cited as a reason for sparing Jerusalem.316 Alexander conquering the air. Jean Wauquelin Les faits et conqutes dAlexandre le Grand 14481449 In Hindi and Urdu the name Sikandar derived from the Persian name for Alexander denotes a rising young talent and the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji stylized himself as SikandariSani the Second Alexander the Great.317 In medieval India Turkic and Afghan sovereigns from the Iraniancultured region of Central Asia brought positive cultural connotations of Alexander to the Indian subcontinent resulting in the efflorescence of Sikandernameh Alexander Romances written by IndoPersian poets such as Amir Khusrau and the prominence of Alexander the Great as a popular subject in Mughalera Persian miniatures.318 In medieval Europe Alexander the Great was revered as a member of the Nine Worthies a group of heroes whose lives were believed to encapsulate all the ideal qualities of chivalry.319 During the first Italian campaign of the French Revolutionary Wars in a question from Bourrienne asking whether he gave his preference to Alexander or Caesar Napoleon said that he places Alexander The Great in the first rank the main reason being his campaign on Asia.320 In the Greek Anthology there are poems referring to Alexander.321322 Throughout time art objects related to Alexander were being created. In addition to speech works sculptures and paintings in modern times Alexander is still the subject of musical and cinematic works. The song Alexander the Great by the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden is indicative. Some films that have been shot with the theme of Alexander are Sikandar 1941 an Indian production directed by Sohrab Modi about the conquest of India by Alexander323 Alexander the Great 1956 produced by MGM and starring Richard Burton SikandareAzam 1965 an Indian production directed by Kedar Kapoor Alexander 2004 directed by Oliver Stone starring Colin Farrell There are also many references to other movies and TV series. Newer novels about Alexander are The trilogy Alexander the Great by Valerio Massimo Manfredi consisting of The son of the dream The sand of Amon and The ends of the world. The trilogy of Mary Renault consisting of Fire from Heaven The Persian Boy and Funeral Games. The Virtues of War about Alexander the Great 2004 ISBN 9780385500999 and  The Afghan Campaign about Alexander the Greats conquests in Afghanistan 2006 ISBN 9780385516419 by Steven Pressfield. Irish playwright Aubrey Thomas de Vere wrote Alexander the Great a Dramatic Poem. Historiography Main article Historiography of Alexander the Great Apart from a few inscriptions and fragments texts written by people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander were all lost.19 Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexanders campaign historian Callisthenes Alexanders generals Ptolemy and Nearchus Aristobulus a junior officer on the campaigns and Onesicritus Alexanders chief helmsman. Their works are lost but later works based on these original sources have survived. The earliest of these is Diodorus Siculus 
1 st century BC followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus midtolate 
1 st century AD Arrian 
1 st to 
2 nd century AD the biographer Plutarch 
1 st to 
2 nd century AD and finally Justin whose work dated as late as the 
4 th century.19 Of these Arrian is generally considered the most reliable given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources closely followed by Diodorus.19 See also History portal Greece portal Iran portal Egypt portal Alexander the Great in Islamic tradition Ancient Macedonian army Bucephalus Chronology of European exploration of Asia Horns of Alexander List of biblical figures identified in extrabiblical sources List of people known as The Great Gates of Alexander Military tactics of Alexander the Great Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great Theories about Alexander the Great in the Quran References Notes  Heracles was Alexanders alleged illegitimate son.  The name  derives from the Greek verb  alx lit.ward off avert defend324325 and  andr the stem of  anr lit.man326325 and means protector of men.327  The first known person to call Alexander the Great was a Roman playwright named Plautus 254184 BC in his play Mostellaria.328  Macedon was an Ancient Greek polity the Macedonians were a Greek tribe.329  By the time of his death he had conquered the entire Achaemenid Persian Empire adding it to Macedons European territories according to some modern writers this was most of the world then known to the ancient Greeks the Ecumene.330331 An approximate view of the world known to Alexander can be seen in Hecataeus of Miletuss map see Hecataeus world map.  For instance Hannibal supposedly ranked Alexander as the greatest general332 Julius Caesar wept on seeing a statue of Alexander since he had achieved so little by the same age333 Pompey and Alauddin Khalji consciously posed as the new Alexander334 the young Napoleon Bonaparte also encouraged comparisons with Alexander. Napoleon also placed Alexander in the first rank.335 Caracalla believed himself to be the actual reincarnation of Alexander.336337338 Caligula wore the breastplate of Alexander in order to show his power.339340 Fidel Castros hero was Alexander the Great whose Spanish equivalent Alejandro he adopted as his nom de guerre.341 Among Ottoman sultans Mehmed IIs heroes were Alexander and Achilles.342 In a letter to his rival Selim I while equating himself with Alexander compares Ismail I as Darius of our days.343 Paolo Giovio in a work written for Charles V says that Selim holds Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar in the highest esteem above all the generals of old.344  In ancient historiography the Argead dynasty was traditionally regarded as having originated from Argos. The Argeads themselves claimed Argive Greek descent from the hero Temenus. Through his parents genealogy ancient authors traced Alexanders descent back to heroes and other legendary figures from Greek mythology such as Heracles and Achilles.345346  There have been since the time many suspicions that Pausanias was actually hired to murder Philip. Suspicion has fallen upon Alexander Olympias and even the newly crowned Persian Emperor Darius III. All three of these people had motive to have Philip murdered.347  However Arrian who used Ptolemy as a source said that Alexander crossed with more than 5000 horse and 30000 foot Diodorus quoted the same totals but listed 5100 horse and 32000 foot. Diodorus also referred to an advance force already present in Asia which Polyaenus in his Stratagems of War

No record at all exists of such a woman ie Barsine accompanying his march nor of any claim by her or her powerful kin that she had borne him offspring. Yet twelve years after his death a boy was produced seventeen years old born therefore five years after Damascus her alleged son brought up in Pergamon a claimant and shortlived pawn in the succession wars chosen probably for a physical resemblance to Alexander. That he actually did marry another Barsine must have helped both to launch and preserve the story but no source reports any notice whatever taken by him of a child who Roxanes being posthumous would have been during his lifetime his only son by a nearroyal mother.
