He was the fourth of the Five Good Emperors from the NervaAntonine dynasty.3 Born into a senatorial family Antoninus held various offices during the reign of Emperor Hadrian. He married Hadrians niece Faustina and Hadrian adopted him as his son and successor shortly before his death. Antoninus acquired the cognomen Pius after his accession to the throne either because he compelled the Senate to deify his adoptive father4 or because he had saved senators sentenced to death by Hadrian in his later years.5 His reign is notable for the peaceful state of the Empire with no major revolts or military incursions during this time. A successful military campaign in southern Scotland early in his reign resulted in the construction of the Antonine Wall. Antoninus was an effective administrator leaving his successors a large surplus in the treasury expanding free access to drinking water throughout the Empire encouraging legal conformity and facilitating the enfranchisement of freed slaves. He died of illness in AD 161 and was succeeded by his adopted sons Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus as coemperors. Early lifeedit Childhood and familyedit Antoninus Pius was born Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Antoninus near Lanuvium modernday Lanuvio in Italy to Titus Aurelius Fulvus consul in 89 and wife Arria Fadilla.36 The Aurelii Fulvi were an Aurelian family settled in Nemausus modern Nmes.7 Titus Aurelius Fulvus was the son of a senator of the same name who as legate of Legio III Gallica had supported Vespasian in his bid to the Imperial office and been rewarded with a suffect consulship plus an ordinary one under Domitian in 85. The Aurelii Fulvi were therefore a relatively new senatorial family from Gallia Narbonensis whose rise to prominence was supported by the Flavians.8 The link between Antoninus family and their home province explains the increasing importance of the post of proconsul of Gallia Narbonensis during the late second century.9 Antoninus father had no other children and died shortly after his 89 ordinary consulship. Antoninus was raised by his maternal grandfather Gnaeus Arrius Antoninus3 reputed by contemporaries to be a man of integrity and culture and a friend of Pliny the Younger.10 The Arrii Antonini were an older senatorial family from Italy very influential during Nervas reign. Arria Fadilla Antoninus mother married afterwards Publius Julius Lupus suffect consul in 98 from that marriage came two daughters Arria Lupula and Julia Fadilla.11 Marriage and childrenedit Statue of Faustina the Elder in the Getty Villa Some time between 110 and 115 Antoninus married Annia Galeria Faustina the Elder.12 They are believed to have enjoyed a happy marriage. Faustina was the daughter of consul Marcus Annius Verus II3 and Rupilia Faustina a stepsister to the Empress Vibia Sabina.1314 Faustina was a beautiful woman and despite rumours about her character it is clear that Antoninus cared for her deeply.15 Faustina bore Antoninus four children two sons and two daughters.16 They were Marcus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus died before 138 his sepulchral inscription has been found at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.1718 Marcus Galerius Aurelius Antoninus died before 138 his sepulchral inscription has been found at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.1719 His name appears on a Greek Imperial coin. Aurelia Fadilla died in 135 she married Lucius Plautius Lamia Silvanus consul 145. She appeared to have no children with her husband and her sepulchral inscription has been found in Italy.20 Annia Galeria Faustina Minor or Faustina the Younger between 125 and 130175 a future Roman Empress married her maternal cousin Marcus Aurelius in 1
46.7  When Faustina died in 141 Antoninus was greatly distressed.21 In honour of her memory he asked the Senate to deify her as a goddess and authorised the construction of a temple to be built in the Roman Forum in her name with priestesses serving in her temple.22 He had various coins with her portrait struck in her honor. These coins were scripted DIVA FAUSTINA and were elaborately decorated. He further founded a charity calling it Puellae Faustinianae or Girls of Faustina which assisted destitute girls12 of good family.23 Finally Antoninus created a new alimenta a Roman welfare programme as part of Cura Annonae. The emperor never remarried. Instead he lived with Galeria Lysistrate24 one of Faustinas freed women. Concubinage was a form of female companionship sometimes chosen by powerful men in Ancient Rome especially widowers like Vespasian and Marcus Aurelius. Their union could not produce any legitimate offspring who could threaten any heirs such as those of Antoninus. Also as one could not have a wife and an official concubine or two concubines at the same time Antoninus avoided being pressed into a marriage with a noblewoman from another family. Later Marcus Aurelius would also reject the advances of his former fiance Ceionia Fabia Lucius Veruss sister on the grounds of protecting his children from a stepmother and took a concubine instead.252627 Favour with Hadrianedit Marble bust of Antoninus Pius 138161 British Museum London Having filled the offices of quaestor and praetor with more than usual success28 he obtained the consulship in 12012 having as his colleague Lucius Catilius Severus.29 He was next appointed by the Emperor Hadrian as one of the four proconsuls to administer Italia30 his district including Etruria where he had estates.31 He then greatly increased his reputation by his conduct as proconsul of Asia probably during 1341
35.3 0 He acquired much favor with Hadrian who adopted him as his son and successor on 25 February 13832 after the death of his first adopted son Lucius Aelius33 on the condition that Antoninus would in turn adopt Marcus Annius Verus the son of his wifes brother and Lucius son of Lucius Aelius who afterwards became the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus.12 He also adopted briefly the name Imperator Titus Aelius Caesar Antoninus in preparation for his rule.34 There seems to have been some opposition to Antoninus appointment on the part of other potential claimants among them his former consular colleague Lucius Catilius Severus then prefect of the city. Nevertheless Antoninus assumed power without opposition.35 Emperoredit The Roman Empire during the reign of Antoninus Pius On his accession Antoninus name and style became Imperator Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pontifex Maximus. One of his first acts as Emperor was to persuade the Senate to grant divine honours to Hadrian which they had at first refused36 his efforts to persuade the Senate to grant these honours is the most likely reason given for his title of Pius dutiful in affection compare pietas.37 Two other reasons for this title are that he would support his aged fatherinlaw with his hand at Senate meetings and that he had saved those men that Hadrian during his period of illhealth had condemned to death.7 Immediately after Hadrians death Antoninus approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended Marcus betrothal to Ceionia Fabia would be annulled and he would be betrothed to Faustina Antoninus daughter instead. Faustinas betrothal to Ceionias brother Lucius Commodus Marcus future coEmperor would also have to be annulled. Marcus consented to Antoninus proposal.3839 Antoninus built temples theaters and mausoleums promoted the arts and sciences and bestowed honours and financial rewards upon the teachers of rhetoric and philosophy.12 Antoninus made few initial changes when he became emperor leaving intact as far as possible the arrangements instituted by Hadrian.36 Epigraphical and prosopographical research has revealed that Antoninus imperial ruling team centered around a group of closely knit senatorial families most of them members of the priestly congregation for the cult of Hadrian the sodales Hadrianales. According to the German historian H.G. Pflaum prosopographical research of Antoninus ruling team allows us to grasp the deeply conservative character of the ruling senatorial caste.40 He owned palatial villas at Lorium Etruria and Villa Magna Latium. Lack of warfareedit The temple of Antoninus and Faustina in the Roman Forum now the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda. The emperor and his Augusta were deified after their death by Marcus Aurelius. There are no records of any military related acts in his time in which he participated. One modern scholar has written It is almost certain not only that at no time in his life did he ever see let alone command a Roman army but that throughout the twentythree years of his reign he never went within five hundred miles of a legion.41 His reign was the most peaceful in the entire history of the Principate42 notwithstanding the fact that there were several military disturbances in the Empire in his time. Such disturbances happened in Mauretania where a senator was named as governor of Mauretania Tingitana in place of the usual equestrian procurator43 and cavalry reinforcements from Pannonia were brought in44 towns such as Sala and Tipasa being fortified.45 Similar disturbances took place in Judea and amongst the Brigantes in Britannia however these were considered less serious than prior and later revolts among both.42 It was however in Britain that Antoninus decided to follow a new more aggressive path with the appointment of a new governor in 139 Quintus Lollius Urbicus36 a native of Numidia and previously governor of Germania Inferior46 as well as a new man.47 Under instructions from the emperor Lollius undertook an invasion of southern Scotland winning some significant victories and constructing the Antonine Wall48 from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde. The wall however was soon gradually decommissioned during the mid1
50 s and eventually abandoned late during the reign early 1
60 s for reasons that are still not quite clear.4950 Antonines Wall is mentioned in just one literary source Antoninus biography in the Historia Augusta. Pausanias makes a brief and confused mention of a war in Britain. In one inscription honouring Antoninus erected by Legio II Augusta which participated in the building of the Wall a relief showing four naked prisoners one of them beheaded seems to stand for some actual warfare.51 Statue of Antoninus Pius in military garb and muscle cuirass from the Museo Chiaramonti Vatican Museums Although Antonines Wall was in principle much shorter 37 miles in length as opposed to 73 and at first sight more defensible than Hadrians Wall the additional area that it enclosed within the Empire was barren with land use for grazing already in decay.52 This meant that supply lines to the wall were strained enough such as the costs for maintaining the additional territory outweighed the benefits of doing so.53 Also in the absence of urban development and the ensuing Romanization process the rear of the wall could not be lastingly pacified.54 It has been therefore speculated that the invasion of Lowland Scotland and the building of the wall had to do mostly with internal politics that is offering Antoninus an opportunity to gain some modicum of necessary military prestige at the start of his reign. Actually the campaign in Britannia was followed by an Imperial salutation that is by Antoninus formally taking for the second and last time the title of Imperator in 1
42.5 5 The fact that around the same time coins were struck announcing a victory in Britain points to Antoninus need to publicise his achievements.56 The orator Fronto was later to say that although Antoninus bestowed the direction of the British campaign to others he should be regarded as the helmsman who directed the voyage whose glory therefore belonged to him.57 That this quest for some military achievement responded to an actual need is proved by the fact that although generally peaceful Antoninus reign was not free from attempts at usurpation Historia Augusta mentions two made by the senators Cornelius Priscianus for disturbing the peace of Spain58 Priscianus had also been Lollius Urbicus successor as governor of Britain and Atilius Rufius Titianus possibly a troublemaker already exiled under Hadrian59. Both attempts are confirmed by the Fasti Ostienses as well as by the erasing of Priscianus name from an inscription.60 In both cases Antoninus was not in formal charge of the ensuing repression Priscianus committed suicide and Titianus was found guilty by the Senate with Antoninus abstaining from sequestering their families properties.61 A coin of Antoninus Pius showing a subdued Parthia PARTHIA on the reverse handing the crown to him an empty claim that Parthia was still subject to Rome after the events surrounding Parthamaspates62 There were also some troubles in Dacia Inferior which required the granting of additional powers to the procurator governor and the dispatch of additional soldiers to the province.49 On the northern Black Sea coast the Greek city of Olbia was held against the Scythians.63 Also during his reign the governor of Upper Germany probably Caius Popillius Carus Pedo built new fortifications in the Agri Decumates advancing the Limes Germanicus fifteen miles forward in his province and neighboring Raetia.64 In the East Roman suzerainty over Armenia was retained by the choice in AD 140 of Arsacid scion Sohaemus as client king.65 Nevertheless Antoninus was virtually unique among emperors in that he dealt with these crises without leaving Italy once during his reign66 but instead dealt with provincial matters of war and peace through their governors or through imperial letters to the cities such as Ephesus of which some were publicly displayed. This style of government was highly praised by his contemporaries and by later generations.67 Antoninus was the last Roman Emperor recognised by the Indian Kingdoms especially the Kushan Empire.68 Raoul McLaughlin quotes Aurelius Victor as saying The Indians the Bactrians and the Hyrcanians all sent ambassadors to Antoninus. They had all heard about the spirit of justice held by this great emperor justice that was heightened by his handsome and grave countenance and his slim and vigorous figure. Due to the outbreak of the Antonine epidemic and wars against northern Germanic tribes the reign of Marcus Aurelius was forced to alter the focus of foreign policies and matters relating to the Far East were increasingly abandoned in favour of those directly concerning the Empires survival.68 Economy and administrationedit An aureus of Antoninus Pius 145 AD. Inscription ANTONINVS AVG PIVS PP  TR POT COS IIII Antoninus was regarded as a skilled administrator and as a builder. In spite of an extensive building directivethe free access of the people of Rome to drinking water was expanded with the construction of aqueducts not only in Rome but throughout the Empire as well as bridges and roadsthe emperor still managed to leave behind a sizable public treasury of around 
2.7  billion sesterces. Rome would not witness another Emperor leaving his successor with a surplus for a long time but this treasury was depleted almost immediately after Antoninuss reign due to the Antonine Plague brought back by soldiers after the Parthian victory.69 The Emperor also famously suspended the collection of taxes from multiple cities affected by natural disasters such as when fires struck Rome and Narbona and earthquakes affected Rhodes and the Province of Asia. He offered hefty financial grants for rebuilding and recovery of various Greek cities after two serious earthquakes the first circa 140 which affected mostly Rhodes and other islands the second in 152 which hit Cyzicus where the huge and newly built Temple to Hadrian was destroyed70 Ephesus and Smyrna. Antoninus financial help earned him praise by Greek writers such as Aelius Aristides and Pausanias.71 These cities received from Antoninus the usual honorific accolades such as when he commanded that all governors of Asia should enter the province when taking office by way of Ephesus.72 Ephesus was specially favoured by Antoninus who confirmed and upheld its distinction of having two temples for the imperial cult neocorate therefore having first place in the list of imperial honor titles surpassing both Smyrna and Pergamon.73 In his dealings with Greekspeaking cities Antoninus followed the policy adopted by Hadrian of ingratiating himself with local elites especially with local intellectuals philosophers teachers of literature rhetoricians and physicians were explicitly exempted from any duties involving private spending for civic purposes a privilege granted by Hadrian that Antoninus confirmed by means of an edict preserved in the Digest 

27.1.6 .
8.7 4 Antoninus also created a chair for the teaching of rhetoric in Athens.75 Antoninus was known as an avid observer of rites of religion and of formal celebrations both Roman and foreign. He is known for having increasingly formalized the official cult offered to the Great Mother which from his reign onwards included a bull sacrifice a taurobolium formerly only a private ritual now being also performed for the sake of the Emperors welfare.76 Antoninus also offered patronage to the worship of Mithras to whom he erected a temple in Ostia.77 In 148 he presided over the celebrations of the 9
00 th anniversary of the founding of Rome. Legal reformsedit Copy inscribed in marble of a letter from Antoninus to the Ephesians from the Bouleuterion at Ephesus 1404 AD explaining how the emperor resolved a dispute between the Roman cities of Ephesus and Smyrna. British Museum London. Antoninus tried to portray himself as a magistrate of the res publica no matter how extended and illdefined his competencies were. He is credited with the splitting of the imperial treasury the fiscus. This splitting had to do with the division of imperial properties into two parts. Firstly the fiscus itself or patrimonium meaning the properties of the Crown the hereditary properties of each succeeding person that sat on the throne transmitted to his successors in office78 regardless of their previous membership in the imperial family.79 Secondly the res privata the private properties tied to the personal maintenance of the Emperor and his family80 something like a Privy Purse. An anecdote in the Historia Augusta biography where Antoninus replies to Faustina who complained about his stinginess that we have gained an empire and lost even what we had before possibly relates to Antoninus actual concerns at the creation of the res privata.81 While still a private citizen Antoninus had increased his personal fortune greatly by means of various legacies the consequence of his caring scrupulously for his relatives.82 Also Antoninus left behind him a reputation for stinginess and was probably determined not to leave his personal property to be swallowed up by the demands of the imperial throne.83 The res privata lands could be sold andor given away while the patrimonium properties were regarded as public.84 It was a way of pretending that the Imperial functionand most properties attached to itwas a public one formally subject to the authority of the Senate and the Roman people.85 That the distinction played no part in subsequent political historythat the personal power of the princeps absorbed his role as officeholderproves that the autocratic logic of the imperial order had already subsumed the old republican institutions.86 Of the public transactions of this period there is only the scantiest of information but to judge by what is extant those twentytwo years were not remarkably eventful in comparison to those before and after the reign.10 However Antoninus did take a great interest in the revision and practice of the law throughout the empire.87 One of his chief concerns was to having local communities conform their legal procedures to existing Roman norms in a case concerning repression of banditry by local police officers irenarchs Greek for peace keepers in Asia Minor Antoninus ordered that these officers should not treat suspects as already condemned and also keep a detailed copy of their interrogations to be used in the possibility of an appeal to the Roman governor.88 Also although Antoninus was not an innovator he would not always follow the absolute letter of the law rather he was driven by concerns over humanity and equality and introduced into Roman law many important new principles based upon this notion.87 In this the emperor was assisted by five chief lawyers Lucius Fulvius Aburnius Valens an author of legal treatises89 Lucius Ulpius Marcellus a prolific writer and three others.87 Of these three the most prominent was Lucius Volusius Maecianus a former military officer turned by Antoninus into a civil procurator and who in view of his subsequent career discovered on the basis of epigraphical and prosopographical research was the Emperors most important legal adviser.90 Maecianus would eventually be chosen to occupy various prefectures see below as well as to conduct the legal studies of Marcus Aurelius. He was also the author of a large work on Fidei commissa Testamentary Trusts. As a hallmark of the increased connection between jurists and the imperial government91 Antoninus reign also saw the appearance of the Institutes of Gaius an elementary legal textbook for beginners.87 Gold aureus of Antoninus 153 AD. ANTONINVS AVG PIVS PP TR P XVII Antoninus passed measures to facilitate the enfranchisement of slaves.92 Mostly he favoured the principle of favor libertatis giving the putative freedman the benefit of the doubt when the claim to freedom was not clearcut.93 Also he punished the killing of a slave by their master without previous trial94 and determined that slaves could be forcibly sold to another master by a proconsul in cases of consistent mistreatment.95 Antoninus upheld the enforcement of contracts for selling of female slaves forbidding their further employment in prostitution.96 In criminal law Antoninus introduced the important principle of the presumption of innocence that accused persons are not to be treated as guilty before trial92 as in the case of the irenarchs see above. It was to Antoninus that the Christian apologist known by the name of Justin Martyr addressed his defense of the Christian faith reminding him of his fathers Emperor Hadrians rule that accusations against Christians required proof.97 Antoninus also asserted the principle that the trial was to be held and the punishment inflicted in the place where the crime had been committed. He mitigated the use of torture in examining slaves by certain limitations. Thus he prohibited the application of torture to children under fourteen years though this rule had exceptions.92 However it must be stressed that Antoninus extended by means of a rescript the use of torture as a means of obtaining evidence to pecuniary cases when it had been applied up until then only in criminal cases.98 Also already at the time torture of free men of low status humiliores had become legal as proved by the fact that Antoninus exempted town councillors expressly from it and also free men of high rank honestiores in general.99 One highlight during his reign occurred in 148 with the ninehundredth anniversary of the foundation of Rome being celebrated by the hosting of magnificent games in Rome.100 It lasted a number of days and a host of exotic animals were killed including elephants giraffes tigers rhinoceroses crocodiles and hippopotamuses. While this increased Antoninuss popularity the frugal emperor had to debase the Roman currency. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 89 to 
83.5  the actual silver weight dropping from 
2.8 8 grams to 
2.6 8 grams.49101 Scholars name Antoninus Pius as the leading candidate for an individual identified as a friend of Rabbi Judah the Prince. According to the Talmud Avodah Zarah 
10 ab Rabbi Judah was very wealthy and greatly revered in Rome. He had a close friendship with Antoninus possibly Antoninus Pius102 who would consult Rabbi Judah on various worldly and spiritual matters. Diplomatic mission to Chinaedit See also SinoRoman relations Green Roman glass cup unearthed from an Eastern Han dynasty 25220 AD tomb Guangxi China The first group of people claiming to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded in 166 AD by the Hou Hanshu.103 Harper 2017104 states that the embassy was likely to be a group of merchants as many Roman merchants traveled to India and some might have gone beyond while there are no records of official ambassadors of Rome travelling as far east. The group came to Emperor Huan of Han China and claimed to be an embassy from Andun Chinese  ndn for Antoninus king of Daqin Rome.105 As Antoninus Pius died in 161 leaving the empire to his adoptive son Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and the envoy arrived in 166 confusion remains about who sent the mission given that both Emperors were named Antoninus.106107108 The Roman mission came from the south therefore probably by sea entering China by the frontier province of Jiaozhi at Rinan or Tonkin presentday northern Vietnam. It brought presents of rhinoceros horns ivory and tortoise shell probably acquired in South Asia.103109 The text specifically states that it was the first time there had been direct contact between the two countries.103110 Furthermore a piece of Republicanera Roman glassware has been found at a Western Han tomb in Guangzhou along the South China Sea dated to the early 
1 st century BC.111 Roman golden medallions made during the reign of Antoninus Pius and perhaps even Marcus Aurelius have been found at c Eo in southern Vietnam then part of the Kingdom of Funan near the Chinese province of Jiaozhi.112113 This may have been the port city of Kattigara described by Ptolemy c.150 as being visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander and lying beyond the Golden Chersonese i.e. Malay Peninsula.112113 Roman coins from the reigns of Tiberius to Aurelian have been discovered in Xian China site of the Han capital Changan although the significantly greater amount of Roman coins unearthed in India suggest the Roman maritime trade for purchasing Chinese silk was centered there not in China or even the overland Silk Road running through ancient Iran.114 Death and legacyedit Ruins of the triumphal arch of Antoninus Pius outside the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore in Eleusis Greece imitating Hadrians Arch in Athens In 156 Antoninus Pius turned 70. He found it difficult to keep himself upright without stays. He started nibbling on dry bread to give him the strength to stay awake through his morning receptions. Marcus Aurelius had already been created consul with Antoninus in 140 receiving the title of Caesar i.e. heir apparent.115 As Antoninus aged Marcus took on more administrative duties. Marcuss administrative duties increased again after the death in 156 or 157 of one of Antoninus most trusted advisers Marcus Gavius Maximus. For twenty years Gavius Maximus had been praetorian prefect an office that was as much secretarial as military.116117 Gavius Maximus had been awarded with the consular insignia and the honours due a senator.118 He had a reputation as a most strict disciplinarian vir severissimus according to Historia Augusta and some fellow equestrian procurators held lasting grudges against him. A procurator named Gaius Censorius Niger died while Gavius Maximus was alive. In his will Censorius Niger vilified Maximus creating serious embarrassment for one of the heirs the orator Fronto.119 Gavius Maximus death initiated a change in the ruling team. It has been speculated that it was the legal adviser Lucius Volusius Maecianus who assumed the role of grey eminence. Maecianus was briefly Praefect of Egypt and subsequently Praefectus annonae in Rome. If it was Maecianus who rose to prominence he may have risen precisely in order to prepare the incomingand unprecedentedjoint succession.120 In 160 Marcus and Lucius were designated joint consuls for the following year. Perhaps Antoninus was already ill in any case he died before the year was out probably on 7 March.125 The bust of Antoninus Pius at the Museo del Prado Madrid Two days before his death the biographer reports Antoninus was at his ancestral estate at Lorium in Etruria126127 about twelve miles 19 km from Rome.127 He ate Alpine cheese at dinner quite greedily. In the night he vomited he had a fever the next day. The day after that he summoned the imperial council and passed the state and his daughter to Marcus. The emperor gave the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered when the tribune of the nightwatch came to ask the password he responded aequanimitas equanimity.128 He then turned over as if going to sleep and died.129130 His death closed out the longest reign since Augustus surpassing Tiberius by a couple of months.126 His record for the secondlongest reign would be unbeaten for 168 years until 329 when it was surpassed by Constantine the Great. Antoninus Pius funeral ceremonies were in the words of the biographer elaborate.131 If his funeral followed the pattern of past funerals his body would have been incinerated on a pyre at the Campus Martius while his spirit would rise to the gods home in the heavens. However it seems that this was not the case according to his Historia Augusta biography which seems to reproduce an earlier detailed report Antoninus body and not his ashes was buried in Hadrians mausoleum. After a sevenday interval justitium Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification.132 In contrast to their behaviour during Antoninus campaign to deify Hadrian the senate did not oppose the emperors wishes. A flamen or cultic priest was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Antoninus now Divus Antoninus. A column was dedicated to Antoninus on the Campus Martius12 and the temple he had built in the Forum in 141 to his deified wife Faustina was rededicated to the deified Faustina and the deified Antoninus.128 It survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda.133 Historiographyedit Arch of Antoninus Pius in Sbetla Tunisia. Statue of Antoninus Pius Palazzo Altemps Rome The only intact account of his life handed down to us is that of the Augustan History an unreliable and mostly fabricated work. Nevertheless it still contains information that is considered reasonably sound for instance it is the only source that mentions the erection of the Antonine Wall in Britain.134 Antoninus is unique among Roman emperors in that he has no other biographies.original research Antoninus in many ways was the ideal of the landed gentleman praised not only by ancient Romans but also by later scholars of classical history such as Edward Gibbon135 or the author of the article on Antoninus Pius in the Encyclopdia Britannica Eleventh Edition.10 A few months afterwards on Hadrians death he was enthusiastically welcomed to the throne by the Roman people who for once were not disappointed in their anticipation of a happy reign. For Antoninus came to his new office with simple tastes kindly disposition extensive experience a welltrained intelligence and the sincerest desire for the welfare of his subjects. Instead of plundering to support his prodigality he emptied his private treasury to assist distressed provinces and cities and everywhere exercised rigid economy hence the nickname  cumminsplitter. Instead of exaggerating into treason whatever was susceptible of unfavorable interpretation he turned the very conspiracies that were formed against him into opportunities for demonstrating his clemency. Instead of stirring up persecution against the Christians he extended to them the strong hand of his protection throughout the empire. Rather than give occasion to that oppression which he regarded as inseparable from an emperors progress through his dominions he was content to spend all the years of his reign in Rome or its neighbourhood.10 Some historians have a less positive view of his reign. According to the historian J. B. Bury however estimable the man Antoninus was hardly a great statesman. The rest which the Empire enjoyed under his auspices had been rendered possible through Hadrians activity and was not due to his own exertions on the other hand he carried the policy of peace at any price too far and so entailed calamities on the state after his death. He not only had no originality or power of initiative but he had not even the insight or boldness to work further on the new lines marked out by Hadrian.136 German historian Ernst Kornemann has had it in his Rmische Geschichte 2 vols. ed. by H. Bengtson Stuttgart 1954 that the reign of Antoninus comprised a succession of grossly wasted opportunities given the upheavals that were to come. There is more to this argument given that the Parthians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Antoninus death. Kornemanns brief is that Antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders. Michael Grant agrees that it is possible that had Antoninus acted decisively sooner it appears that on his death bed he was preparing a largescale action against the Parthians the Parthians might have been unable to choose their own time but current evidence is not conclusive. Grant opines that Antoninus and his officers did act in a resolute manner dealing with frontier disturbances of his time although conditions for longlasting peace were not created. On the whole according to Grant Marcus Aurelius eulogistic picture of Antoninus seems deserved and Antoninus appears to have been a conservative and nationalistic although he respected and followed Hadrians example of Philhellenism moderately Emperor who was not tainted by the blood of either citizen or foe combined and maintained Numa Pompilius good fortune pacific dutifulness and religious scrupulousness and whose laws removed anomalies and softened harshnesses.137 Krzysztof Ulanowski argues that the claims of military inability are exaggerated considering that although the sources praise Antoninus love for peace and his efforts rather to defend than enlarge the provinces he could hardly be considered a pacifist as shown by the conquest of the Lowlands the building of the Antonine Wall and the expansion of Germania Superior. Ulanowski also praises Antoninus for being successful in deterrence by diplomatic means.138 Descendantsedit Although only one of his four children survived to adulthood Antoninus came to be ancestor to four generations of prominent Romans including the Emperor Commodus. HansGeorg Pflaum has identified five direct descendants of Antoninus and Faustina who were consuls in the first half of the third century.139 Marcus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus died before 138 died young without issue Marcus Galerius Aurelius Antoninus died before 138 died young without issue Aurelia Fadilla died in 135 who married Lucius Plautius Lamia Silvanus suffect consul in 145140 no children known for certain.
