Much of Egypts ancient history was a mystery until Egyptian hieroglyphs were deciphered with the discovery and deciphering of the Rosetta Stone. Among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the Great Pyramid of Giza. Ancient Egyptian civilization coalesced around 3150 BC with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first king of the First Dynasty Narmer. Predominantly native Egyptian rule lasted until the conquest by the Achaemenid Empire in the sixth century BC. In 332 BC Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great conquered Egypt as he toppled the Achaemenids and established the shortlived Macedonian Empire which gave rise to the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom founded in 305 BC by one of Alexanders former generals Ptolemy I Soter. The Ptolemies had to fight native rebellions and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its final annexation by Rome. The death of Cleopatra ended the nominal independence of Egypt resulting in Egypts becoming one of the provinces of the Roman Empire. Roman rule in Egypt including Byzantine lasted from 30 BC to 641 AD with a brief interlude of control by the Sasanian Empire between 619 and 629 known as Sasanian Egypt.1 After the Muslim conquest of Egypt parts of Egypt became provinces of successive Caliphates and other Muslim dynasties Rashidun Caliphate 632661 Umayyad Caliphate 661750 Abbasid Caliphate 750935 Fatimid Caliphate 9091171 Ayyubid Sultanate 11711260 and the Mamluk Sultanate 12501517. In 1517 Ottoman sultan Selim I captured Cairo absorbing Egypt into the Ottoman Empire. Egypt remained entirely Ottoman until 1805 except during French occupation from 1798 to 18
01.2  Starting in 1867 Egypt became a nominally autonomous tributary state called the Khedivate of Egypt. However Khedivate Egypt fell under British control in 1882 following the AngloEgyptian War. After the end of World War I and following the Egyptian revolution of 1919 the Kingdom of Egypt was established. While a de jure independent state the United Kingdom retained control over foreign affairs defense and other matters. British occupation lasted until 1954 with the AngloEgyptian agreement of 1954. The modern Republic of Egypt was founded in 1953 and with the complete withdrawal of British forces from the Suez Canal in 1956 President Gamal Abdel Nasser president from 1956 to 1970 introduced many reforms and created the shortlived United Arab Republic with Syria. His terms also saw the SixDay War and the creation of the international NonAligned Movement. His successor Anwar Sadat president from 1970 to 1981 changed Egypts trajectory departing from many of the political and economic tenets of Nasserism reinstituting a multiparty system and launching the Infitah economic policy. He led Egypt in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 to regain Egypts Sinai Peninsula which Israel had occupied since the SixDay War of 1967. This later led to the EgyptIsrael peace treaty. Recent Egyptian history has been dominated by events following nearly thirty years of rule by the former president Hosni Mubarak. The Egyptian revolution of 2011 deposed Mubarak and resulted in the first democratically elected president in Egyptian history Mohamed Morsi. Unrest after the 2011 revolution and related disputes led to the 2013 Egyptian coup dtat Morsis imprisonment and the election of Abdel Fattah alSisi as president in 2014. Predynastic Egypt pre3150 BCedit Main articles Prehistoric Egypt and Population history of Egypt Artifacts of Egypt from the prehistoric period from 4400 to 3100 BC. First row from top left a Badarian ivory figurine a Naqada II jar a Bat figurine. Second row a diorite vase a flint knife a cosmetic palette. There is evidence of petroglyphs along the Nile terraces and in desert oases. In the 
10 th millennium BC a culture of huntergatherers and fishermen was replaced by a graingrinding culture. Climate changes andor overgrazing around 6000 BC began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt forming the Sahara. Early tribal peoples migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled agricultural economy and more centralized society.3 By about 6000 BC a Neolithic culture had taken root in the Nile Valley.4 During the Neolithic era several predynastic cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt. The Badari culture and the successor Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to dynastic Egypt. The earliest known Lower Egyptian site Merimde predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years. Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years remaining culturally distinct but maintaining frequent contact through trade. The earliest known evidence of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels dated to about 3200 BC.5 Dynastic Egypt 3150332 BCedit Main articles Ancient Egypt and History of ancient Egypt Early Dynastic Period and the Old Kingdomedit Main articles Early dynastic period of Egypt and Old Kingdom of Egypt A unified kingdom was formed in 3150 BC by King Menes leading to a series of dynasties that ruled Egypt for the next three millennia. Egyptian culture flourished during this long period and remained distinctively Egyptian in its religion arts language and customs. The Great Sphinx and the Pyramids of Giza built during the Old Kingdom. The first two ruling dynasties of a unified Egypt set the stage for the Old Kingdom period c. 27002200 BC which constructed many pyramids most notably the pyramid of Djoser constructed during the Third Dynasty and the Giza Pyramids constructed in the Fourth Dynasty. First Intermediate Period the Middle Kingdom and the Second Intermediate Periodedit Main articles First Intermediate Period of Egypt Middle Kingdom of Egypt and Second Intermediate Period of Egypt The First Intermediate Period ushered in a time of political upheaval for about 150 years.6 Stronger Nile floods and stabilization of government however brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the Middle Kingdom c. 2040 BC reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III. A second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt that of the Semiticspeaking Hyksos. The Hyksos migrants67 took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC and founded a new capital at Avaris. They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by Ahmose I who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty and relocated the capital from Memphis to Thebes. New Kingdom Third Intermediate Period and Late Periodedit Main articles New Kingdom of Egypt Third Intermediate Period of Egypt and Late Period of ancient Egypt New Kingdom in the 
15 th century BC The New Kingdom c. 15501070 BC began with the Eighteenth Dynasty marking the rise of Egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire from Syria to Upper Nubia. This period is noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs including Hatshepsut Thutmose III Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti Tutankhamun and Ramesses II. The first historically attested expression of monotheism came during this period as Atenism although somewho consider Atenism to be a form of monolatry rather than of monotheism. Frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the New Kingdom. The country was later ruled and invaded by Libyans Nubians and Assyrians but native Egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country.8 Achaemenid ruleedit Egyptian soldier of the Achaemenid army c.470 BCE. Xerxes I tomb relief. In the sixth century BC the Achaemenid Empire conquered Egypt.9 The entire Twentyseventh Dynasty of Egypt from 525 BC to 402 BC save for Petubastis III and possibly Psammetichus IV was an entirely Persianruled period with the Achaemenid kings being granted the title of pharaoh.9 Amyrtaeus successful rebellion ended the first Achaemenid rule and inaugurated Egypts last significant phase of independence under native rulers. The Thirtieth Dynasty was the last native ruling dynasty during the Pharaonic epoch.9 It fell to the Persians again in 343 BC after the last native Pharaoh King Nectanebo II was defeated in battle.9 Second Achaemenid conquestedit The Thirtyfirst Dynasty of Egypt also known as the Second Egyptian Satrapy was effectively a shortliving province of the Achaemenid Empire between 343 BC to 332 BC.10 After an interval of independence during which three indigenous dynasties reigned the 
28 th 
29 th and 
30 th dynasty Artaxerxes III 358338 BC reconquered the Nile valley for a brief second period 343332 BC which is called the Thirtyfirst Dynasty of Egypt thus starting another period of pharaohs of Persian origin.11 A team led by Johannes Krause managed the first reliable sequencing of the genomes of 90 mummified individuals in 2017. Whilst not conclusive because of the nonexhaustive time frame and restricted location that the mummies represent their study nevertheless showed that these Ancient Egyptians closely resembled ancient and modern Near Eastern populations especially those in the Levant and had almost no DNA from subSaharan Africa. Whats more the genetics of the mummies remained remarkably consistent even as different powersincluding Nubians Greeks and Romansconquered the empire.12 Greek ruleedit Ptolemaic Kingdomedit Main article Ptolemaic Kingdom The Greek Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra and her son by Julius Caesar Caesarion at the Dendera Temple complex. Ptolemaic Egypt c.235 BC. The green areas were lost to the Seleucid Empire thirty five years later. The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state extending from southern Syria in the east to Cyrene to the west and south to the frontier with Nubia. Alexandria became the capital city and a center of Greek culture and trade. To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs. The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress and participated in Egyptian religious life.1314 The last ruler from the Ptolemaic dynasty was Cleopatra who committed suicide following the burial of her lover Mark Antony who had died in her arms from a selfinflicted stab wound after Augustus had captured Alexandria and her mercenary forces had fled. The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome. Nevertheless Hellenistic culture continued to thrive in Egypt well after the Muslim conquest. The native EgyptianCoptic culture continued to exist as well the Coptic language itself was Egypts most widely spoken language until at least the 
10 th century. Roman Egyptedit Roman province of Egyptedit Main article Roman Egypt Egypt quickly became the Empires breadbasket supplying the greater portion of the Empires grain in addition to flax papyrus glass and many other finished goods. The city of Alexandria became a key trading outpost for the Roman Empire by some accounts the most important for a time. Shipping from Egypt regularly reached India and Ethiopia among other international destinations.15 It was also a leading perhaps the leading scientific and technological center of the Empire. Scholars such as Ptolemy Hypatia and Heron broke new ground in astronomy mathematics and other disciplines. Culturally the city of Alexandria at times rivaled Rome in its importance.16 Diocese of Egyptedit Main article Diocese of Egypt The Hanging Church of Cairo first built in the 
3 rd or 
4 th century is one of the most famous Coptic Orthodox churches in Egypt. Christianity reached Egypt relatively early in the evangelist period of the first century traditionally credited to Mark the Evangelist.17 Alexandria Egypt and Antioch Syria quickly became the leading centers of Christianity.18 Diocletians reign marked the transition from the classical Roman to the Late antiqueByzantine era in Egypt when a great number of Egyptian Christians were persecuted. The New Testament had by then been translated into Egyptian. After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451 a distinct Egyptian Coptic Church was firmly established.19 Sassanid Conquest of Egyptedit Sasanian Egypt known in Middle Persian sources as Agiptus refers to the brief rule of Egypt and parts of Libya by the Sasanian Empire which lasted from 619 to 62920 until the Sasanian rebel Shahrbaraz made an alliance with the Byzantine emperor Heraclius and had control over Egypt returned to him.20 Early Islamic Egyptedit Main articles History of Muslim Egypt Tulunids and Ikhshidid dynasty Extent of the Tulunid domains under Khumarawayh in 893 The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Persian invasion early in the 
7 th century until 639642 when Egypt was invaded and conquered by the Arab Islamic Empire. The final loss of Egypt was of incalculable significance to the Byzantine Empire which had relied on Egypt for many agricultural and manufactured goods. When they defeated the Byzantine armies in Egypt the Arabs brought Sunni Islam to the country. Early in this period Egyptians began to blend their new faith with their Christian traditions as well as other indigenous beliefs and practices leading to various Sufi orders that have flourished to this day.17 These earlier rites had survived the period of Coptic Christianity.21 Late Medieval Egyptedit Main articles Fatimid Caliphate Ayyubid dynasty and Mamluk Sultanate The AlAzhar Mosque of medieval Fatimid Cairo. Muslim rulers nominated by the Islamic Caliphate remained in control of Egypt for the next six centuries with Cairo as the seat of the Caliphate under the Fatimids. With the end of the Kurdish Ayyubid dynasty the Mamluks a TurcoCircassian military caste took control about AD 1250. By the late 
13 th century Egypt linked the Red Sea India Malaya and East Indies.22 The Greek and Coptic languages and cultures went into a steep decline in favor of Arabic culture though Coptic managed to last as a spoken language until the 
17 th century and remains a liturgical language today. The Mamluks continued to govern the country until the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517 after which it became a province of the Ottoman Empire. The mid
14 thcentury Black Death killed about 40 of the population of Egypt.23 Evolution of the Fatimid Caliphate Ayyubid Sultanate of Egypt in pink at the death of Saladin in 1193 Extent of the Mamluk Sultanate under Sultan anNasir Muhammad Ottoman Egyptedit Main article History of Ottoman Egypt Selim I 14701520 conquered Egypt After the 
15 th century the Ottoman invasion pushed the Egyptian system into decline. The defensive militarization damaged its civil society and economic institutions.22 The weakening of the economic system combined with the effects of the plague left Egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion. Portuguese traders took over their trade.22 Egypt suffered six famines between 1687 and 17
31.2 4 The 1784 famine cost it roughly onesixth of its population.25 The brief French invasion of Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte began in 1798. The campaign eventually led to the discovery of the Rosetta Stone creating the field of Egyptology. Despite early victories and an initially successful expedition into Syria Napoleon and his Arme dOrient were eventually defeated and forced to withdraw especially after suffering the defeat of the supporting French fleet at the Battle of the Nile. Muhammed Ali Dynastyedit Map of Egypt under Muhammad Ali dynasty The expulsion of the French in 1801 by Ottoman Mamluk and British forces was followed by four years of anarchy in which Ottomans Mamluks and Albanians  who were nominally in the service of the Ottomans  wrestled for power. Out of this chaos the commander of the Albanian regiment Muhammad Ali Kavalali Mehmed Ali Pasha emerged as a dominant figure and in 1805 was acknowledged by the Sultan in Istanbul as his viceroy in Egypt the title implied subordination to the Sultan but this was in fact a polite fiction Ottoman power in Egypt was finished and Muhammad Ali an ambitious and able leader established a dynasty that was to rule Egypt until the revolution of 1952. After 1882 the dynasty became a British puppet.26 Muhammad Alis primary focus was military he annexed Northern Sudan 18201824 Syria 1833 and parts of Arabia and Anatolia but in 1841 the European powers fearful lest he topple the Ottoman Empire itself forced him to return most of his conquests to the Ottomans. He kept the Sudan and his title to Egypt was made hereditary. A more lasting result of his military ambition is that it required him to modernize the country. Eager to adopt the military and therefore industrial techniques of the great powers he sent students to the West and invited training missions to Egypt. He built industries a system of canals for irrigation and transport and reformed the civil service.27 The introduction in 1820 of longstaple cotton the Egyptian variety of which became notable transformed its agriculture into a cashcrop monoculture before the end of the century. The social effects of this were enormous land ownership became concentrated and many foreigners arrived shifting production towards international markets.27 British Protectorate 188219
52 edit Main articles History of Egypt under the British and History of modern Egypt Nationalists demonstrating in Cairo 1919 British indirect rule lasted from 1882 when the British succeeded in defeating the Egyptian Army at Tel elKebir in September and took control of the country to the 1952 Egyptian revolution which made Egypt a republic and when British advisers were expelled. Muhammad Ali was succeeded briefly by his son Ibrahim in September 1848 then by a grandson Abbas I in November 1848 then by Said in 1854 and Ismail in 1863. Abbas I was cautious. Said and Ismail were ambitious developers but they spent beyond their means. The Suez Canal built in partnership with the French was completed in 1869. The cost of this and other projects had two effects it led to enormous debt to European banks and caused popular discontent because of the onerous taxation it required. In 1875 Ismail sold Egypts 44 share in the canal to the British Government. Ismail also tried to conquer the Ethiopian Empire and was defeated twice at Gundet in 1875 and again at the Battle of Gura in 1876. Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French controllers who sat in the Egyptian cabinet and with the financial power of the bondholders behind them were the real power in the Government.28 Local dissatisfaction with Ismail and with European intrusion led to the formation of the first nationalist groupings in 1879 with Ahmad Urabi a prominent figure. In 1882 he became head of a nationalistdominated ministry committed to democratic reforms including parliamentary control of the budget. Fearing a reduction of their control Britain and France intervened militarily bombarding Alexandria and crushing the Egyptian army at the battle of Tel elKebir.29 They reinstalled Ismails son Tewfik as the figurehead of a de facto British protectorate.3031 In 1914 the Protectorate was made official and the Ottoman Empire no longer had a role. The title for the head of state which in 1867 had changed from pasha to khedive was changed again to sultan. Abbas II was deposed as khedive and replaced by his uncle Hussein Kamel as sultan.32 In 1906 the Dinshaway Incident prompted many neutral Egyptians to join the nationalist movement. After the First World War Saad Zaghlul and the Wafd Party led the Egyptian nationalist movement to a majority at the local Legislative Assembly. When the British exiled Zaghlul and his associates to Malta on 8 March 1919 the country arose in its first modern revolution. The revolt led the UK government to issue a unilateral declaration of Egypts independence on 22 February 19
22.3 3 The new government drafted and implemented a constitution in 1923 based on a parliamentary system. Saad Zaghlul was popularly elected as Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924. In 1936 the AngloEgyptian Treaty was concluded. Continued instability due to remaining British influence and increasing political involvement by the king led to the dissolution of the parliament in a military coup dtat known as the 1952 Revolution. The Free Officers Movement forced King Farouk to abdicate in support of his son Fuad. British military presence in Egypt lasted until 19

Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 by Gamal Abdel Nasser  the real architect of the 1952 movement  and was later put under house arrest. Nasser eraedit Main article History of Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser Gamal Abdel Nasser Nasser assumed power as president in June 1956. British forces completed their withdrawal from the occupied Suez Canal Zone on 13 June 1956. He nationalized the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956 prompting the 1956 Suez Crisis. In 1958 Egypt and Syria formed a sovereign union known as the United Arab Republic. The union was shortlived ending in 1961 when Syria seceded thus ending the union. During most of its existence the United Arab Republic was also in a loose confederation with North Yemen the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen known as the United Arab States. In the 1967 SixDay War Israel invaded and occupied Egypts Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip which Egypt had occupied since the 1948 ArabIsraeli War. Three years later 1970 President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat. Sadat eraedit Main article History of Egypt under Anwar Sadat Celebrating the signing of the Camp David Accords Menachem Begin Jimmy Carter Anwar Al Sadat. Sadat switched Egypts Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States expelling Soviet advisors in 1972. He launched the Infitah economic reform policy while clamping down on religious and secular opposition. In 1973 Egypt along with Syria launched the October War a surprise attack against the Israeli forces occupying the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. It was an attempt to regain part of the Sinai territory that Israel had captured six years earlier. Sadat hoped to seize some territory through military force and then regain the rest of the peninsula by diplomacy. The conflict sparked an international crisis between the US and the USSR both of whom intervened. The second UNmandated ceasefire halted military action. While the war ended with a military stalemate it presented Sadat with a political victory that later allowed him to regain the Sinai in return for peace with Israel.citation needed Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in 1977 which led to the 1979 peace treaty in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadats initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypts expulsion from the Arab League but it was supported by most Egyptians.35 On 6 October 1981 Sadat and six diplomats were assassinated while observing a military parade commemorating the eighth anniversary of the October 1973 War. He was succeeded by Hosni Mubarak. Terrorist insurgencyedit Main article Terrorism in Egypt In 19

Celebrations in Tahrir Square after Omar Suleimans statement announcing Hosni Mubaraks resignation On 25 January 2011 widespread protests began against Mubaraks government. The objective of the protest was the removal of Mubarak from power. These took the form of an intensive campaign of civil resistance supported by a very large number of people and mainly consisting of continuous mass demonstrations. By 29 January it was becoming clear that Mubaraks government had lost control when a curfew order was ignored and the army took a semineutral stance on enforcing the curfew decree. On 11 February 2011 Mubarak resigned and fled Cairo. Vice President Omar Suleiman announced that Mubarak had stepped down and that the Egyptian military would assume control of the nations affairs in the short term.4546 Jubilant celebrations broke out in Tahrir Square at the news.47 Mubarak may have left Cairo for Sharm elSheikh the previous night before or shortly after the airing of a taped speech in which Mubarak vowed he would not step down or leave.48 On 13 February 2011 the high level military command of Egypt announced that both the constitution and the parliament of Egypt had been dissolved. The parliamentary election was to be held in September.49 A constitutional referendum was held on 19 March 20

Turnout was high and there were no reports of violence although members of some parties broke the ban on campaigning at polling places by handing out pamphlets and banners.51 There were however complaints of irregularities.52 Morsis presidencyedit Main article Timeline of the Egyptian Crisis under Mohamed Morsi The first round of a presidential election was held in Egypt on 23 and 24 May 2012. Mohamed Morsi won 25 of the vote and Ahmed Shafik the last prime minister under deposed leader Hosni Mubarak 24. A second round was held on 16 and 17 June.

35 member cabinet including 28 newcomers of whom four came from the influential Muslim Brotherhood while six and the former interim military ruler Mohamed Hussein Tantawi as the Defence Minister came from the previous Government.57 On 22 November 2012 Morsi issued a declaration immunizing his decrees from challenge and seeking to protect the work of the constituent assembly drafting the new constitution.58 The declaration also requires a retrial of those accused in the Mubarakera killings of protesters who had been acquitted and extends the mandate of the constituent assembly by two months. Additionally the declaration authorizes Morsi to take any measures necessary to protect the revolution. Liberal and secular groups previously walked out of the constitutional constituent assembly because they believed that it would impose strict Islamic practices while Muslim Brotherhood backers threw their support behind Morsi.59 The move was criticized by Mohamed ElBaradei the leader of Egypts Constitution Party who stated Morsi today usurped all state powers  appointed himself Egypts new pharaoh on his Twitter feed.60 The move led to massive protests and violent action throughout Egypt.61 On 5 December 2012 Tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of Egypts president clashed hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails and brawling in Cairos streets in what was described as the largest violent battle between Islamists and their foes since the countrys revolution.62 Six senior advisors and three other officials resigned from the government and the countrys leading Islamic institution called on Morsi to stem his powers. Protesters also clamored from coastal cities to desert towns.63 Morsi offered a national dialogue with opposition leaders but refused to cancel a 15 December vote on a draft constitution written by an Islamistdominated assembly that has ignited two weeks of political unrest.63 A constitutional referendum was held in two rounds on 15 and 22 December 2012 with 64 support and 33 against.64 It was signed into law by a presidential decree issued by Morsi on 26 December 20
12.6 5 On 3 July 2013 the constitution was suspended by order of the Egyptian army.66 On 30 June 2013 on the first anniversary of the election of Morsi millions of protesters across Egypt took to the streets and demanded the immediate resignation of the president. On 1 July the Egyptian Armed Forces issued a 
48 hour ultimatum that gave the countrys political parties until 3 July to meet the demands of the Egyptian people. The presidency rejected the Egyptian Armys 
48 hour ultimatum vowing that the president would pursue his own plans for national reconciliation to resolve the political crisis. On 3 July General Abdel Fattah elSisi head of the Egyptian Armed Forces announced that he had removed Morsi from power suspended the constitution and would be calling new presidential and Shura Council elections and named Supreme Constitutional Courts leader Adly Mansour as acting president.67 Mansour was sworn in on 4 July 20

On 24 March 2014 529 Morsis supporters were sentenced to death while the trial of Morsi himself was still ongoing.70 Having delivered a final judgement 492 sentences were commuted to life imprisonment with 37 death sentences being upheld. On 28 April another mass trial took place with 683 Morsi supporters sentenced to death for killing 1 police officer.71 In 2015 Egypt participated in the Saudi Arabianled intervention in Yemen.72 ElSisi Presidencyedit Main article Abdel Fattah elSisi Satellite image of Ever Given blocking the canal in March 2021 In the elections of June 2014 ElSisi won with a percentage of

President Abdel Fattah alSisi was also allowed to run for third term in next election in 20
24.7 7 Under ElSisi Egypt is said to have returned to authoritarianism. New constitutional reforms have been implemented meaning strengthening the role of military and limiting the political opposition.78 The constitutional changes were accepted in a referendum in April 20
19.7 9 In December 2020 final results of the parliamentary election confirmed a clear majority of the seats for Egypts Mostaqbal Want Nations Future Party which strongly supports president ElSisi. The party even increased its majority partly because of new electoral rules.80 During the 20202021 Tigray War Egypt was also involved. On 19 December 2020 an EEPA report stated based on testimonials of three Egyptian officials and one European diplomat that the UAE used its base in Assab Eritrea to launch drones strikes against Tigray. The investigative platform Bellingcat confirmed the presence of Chineseproduced drones at the UAEs military base in Assab Eritrea. Egyptian officials were concerned about strengthening ties between the UAE and Israel. They fear that both countries will collaborate in the construction of an alternative to the Suez Canal starting from Haifa in Israel.81 On 19 December 2020 Egypt was reportedly encouraging Sudan to support the TPLF in Tigray. It wants to strengthen a joint position in relation to negotiations on the GERD Dam which impacts both countries downstream.81 See alsoedit History of Cairo History of Alexandria List of Egyptian inventions and discoveries Population history of Egypt Timeline of Alexandria Timeline of Cairo Referencesedit  Snger Patrick.
