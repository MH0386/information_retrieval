She ascended to the throne following the death of Amenemhat IV possibly her brother or husband though their relationship is unproven. Instead she asserted legitimacy through her father Amenemhat III. Her reign lasted 3 years 10 months and 24 days according to the Turin King List. She adopted the full royal titulary distinguishing herself from prior female rulers. She was also the first ruler to have a name associated with the crocodile god Sobek. Contemporary evidence for her reign is scant there are a few partial statues  one with her face  and inscriptions that have been uncovered. It is assumed that the Northern Mazghuna pyramid was intended for her though this assignment is speculative with no firm evidence to confirm it. The monument was abandoned with only the substructure ever completed. A papyrus discovered in Harageh mentions a place called Sekhem Sobekneferu that may refer to the pyramid. Her rule is attested on several king lists. Familyedit See also Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt family tree Amenemhat III father of Sobekneferu Sobekneferu was the daughter of Pharaoh Amenemhat III518 but her mothers identity is unknown.19 Amenemhat III had two known wives Aat and an unnamed queen both buried in his pyramid at Dahshur. He had at least one other daughter Neferuptah who had a burial at his second pyramid at Hawara that was eventually moved to her own pyramid.20 Neferuptah appears to have been groomed as Amenemhat IIIs heir as she had her name enclosed in a cartouche.21 Evidence of burials of three other princesses  Hathorhotep Nubhotepet and Sithathor  were found at the Dahshur complex but it is not clear whether these princesses were his daughters as the complex was used for royal burials throughout the Thirteenth Dynasty.22 Amenemhat IIIs eventual heir Amenemhat IV is attested to be the son of Hetepti though her titulary lacks reference to her being a Kings Wife.23 The relationship between Amenemhat IV and Sobekneferu remains unclear. According to the ancient historian Manetho in Aegyptiaca they were brother and sister.5 According to Gae Callender they were also probably married.24 Although neither the title of Kings Wife nor Kings Sister are attested for Sobekneferu.19 Sobekneferus accession may have been motivated by the lack of a male heir for Amenemhat IV.5 However two kings of the Thirteenth Dynasty Sobekhotep I and Sonbef have been identified as possible sons of his based on their shared nomen Amenemhat.25 As such Sobekneferu may have usurped the throne after Amenemhat IVs death viewing his heirs as illegitimate.26 Female kingshipedit Sobekneferu was one of the few women that ruled in Egypt2728 and the first to adopt the full royal titulary distinguishing herself from any prior female rulers.529 She was also the first ruler associated with the crocodile god Sobek by name whose identity appears in both her birth and throne names.30 Kara Cooney views ancient Egypt as unique in allowing women to acquire formal  and absolute  power. She posits that women were elevated to the throne during crises to guide the civilization and maintain social order. Though she also notes that this elevation to power was illusory. Women acquired the throne as temporary replacements for a male leader their reigns were regularly targeted for erasure by their successors and overall Egyptian society was oppressive to women.31 In ancient Egyptian historiography there is some evidence for other female rulers. As early as the First Dynasty Merneith is proposed to have ruled as regent for her son.32 In the Fifth Dynasty Setibhor may have been a female king regnant based on the manner her monuments were targets for destruction.33 Another candidate Nitocris is generally considered to have ruled in the Sixth Dynasty34 though there is little proof of her historicity3335 and she is not mentioned before the Eighteenth Dynasty.34 The kingship of Nitocris may instead be a Greek legend35 and that the name originated with an incorrect translation of the name of the male pharaoh Neitiqerty Siptah.36 Reignedit Serpentinite statuette head of Sobekneferu from the Louvre Paris The Middle Kingdom was in decline by the time of Sobekneferus accession.37 The peak of the Middle Kingdom is attributed to Senusret III and Amenemhat III.3839 Senusret III formed the basis for the legendary character Sesostris described by Manetho and Herodotus.4041 He led military expeditions into Nubia and into SyriaPalestine4243 and built a 60 m 200 ft tall mudbrick pyramid as his monument.44 He reigned for 39 years as evidenced by an inscription in Abydos where he was buried.45 Amenemhat III in contrast presided over a peaceful Egypt that consisted of monumental constructions the development of Faiyum and numerous mining expeditions.4647 His reign lasted at least 45 years probably longer.24 He built two pyramids at Dahshur and at Hawara.48 Nicolas Grimal notes that such long reigns contributed to the end of the Twelfth Dynasty but without the collapse that ended the Old Kingdom.37 Amenemhat IV ruled for 9 or 10 years.49 There is little information regarding his reign.24 It is to this backdrop that Sobekneferu acquired the throne.37 She reigned for around 4 years but as with her predecessor there are few surviving records.50 Her death brought a close to the Twelfth Dynasty5152 and began the Second Intermediate Period spanning the following two centuries.53 This period is poorly understood owing to the paucity of references to the rulers of the time.54 She was succeeded by either Sobekhotep I55 or Wegaf56 who inaugurated the Thirteenth Dynasty.37 Stephen Quirke proposed based on the numerosity of kingships and brevity of their rule that a rotating succession of kings from Egypts most powerful families took the throne.5057 They retained Itjtawy as their capital through the Thirteenth Dynasty.5859 Their role however was relegated to a much lesser status than earlier and power rested within the administration.5759 It is generally accepted that Egypt remained unified until late into the dynasty.58 Kim Ryholt contends that the Fourteenth Dynasty instead arose in the Nile Delta at the end of Sobekneferus reign as a rival to the Thirteenth.60 Thomas Schneider argues that the evidence for this hypothesis is weak.61 Attestationsedit Contemporary evidenceedit Bust of Sobekneferu in the Louvre Museum Only a small collection of sources attest to Sobekneferus rule as pharaoh of Egypt.50 A graffito in Kumma a Nubian fortress records the height of the Nile inundation at

0.6 1 in.64 A handful of headless statues of Sobekneferu have been identified.55065 In one quartzite image she blends feminine and masculine dress with an inscription reading daughter of Re of his body Sobekneferu may she live like Re forever.5065 On her torso rests a pendant modelled on that worn by Senusret III.65 Three basalt statues of the female king were found in Tell edDaba66 two depict her in a seated posture another shows her kneeling.6768 In one she is depicted trampling the Nine Bows representing the subjugation of Egypts enemies.5 The three statues appear to be lifesized.68 One statue with her head is known. The bust was held in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin but was lost during World War II. Its existence is confirmed by photographic images and plaster casts. It fits on top of the lower part of a seated statuette discovered at Semna which bears the royal symbol sm twy on the side of the throne.69 The lower half is held at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston.7071 Damaged statuette of a Late Middle Kingdom Queen in the Metropolitan Museum of Art thought to represent Sobekneferu. There is a damaged statuette in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York that has been suggested to represent Sobekneferu though this assignment is unverified.70 The schist bust depicts a woman in a wig wearing a crown composed of a uraeus cobra and two vultures with outstretched wings which is of unknown iconography and the bsd cloak.5072 The base of another statue bearing her name and identified as the representation of a kings royal daughter was discovered in Gezer though it may also refer to a daughter of Senusret I or another unknown Sobekneferu.7374 A headless black basalt sphinx discovered by douard Naville in KhatanaQantir bearing a damaged inscription is also tentatively assigned to Sobekneferu.75 There is evidence that she had structures built in Heracleopolis Magna and added to the Pyramid of Amenemhat III in Hawara.50 She left inscriptions on four granite papyriform columns found at a temple in Kom elAkrib while a further ten granite beams there may date to the same period.76 Her monumental works consistently associate her with Amenemhat III rather than Amenemhat IV supporting the theory that she was the royal daughter of Amenemhat III and perhaps only a stepsister to Amenemhat IV whose mother was not royal. Contemporary sources from her reign show that Sobekneferu adopted only the Kings Daughter title which further supports this hypothesis.73 An example of such an inscription comes from a limestone block of the Labyrinth of the Pyramid at Hawara. It reads Beloved of Ddt the good god Nmtr Amenemhat III given ...  Daughter of Re Sobekneferu lord of Shedet given all life. The inscription is also the only known reference to a goddess Ddt.7778 By contrast Amenemhat IVs name does not appear at Hawara.79 Historical sourcesedit Drawing by Flinders Petrie of the cylinder seal of Sobekneferu in the British Museum80 She is mentioned on the Karnak list of early Egyptian kings81 the Saqqara Tablet82 and Turin King List50 but is conspicuously excluded from the Abydos king list.83 Her exclusion along with all other female kings pharaohs of the First and Second Intermediate Periods and of the Amarna Period is an indicator of whom Ramesses II and Seti I viewed as the legitimate rulers of Egypt.83 She is credited in the Turin Canon with a reign of 3 years 10 months and 24 days.498485 She is mentioned by Manetho as Scemiophris where she is credited with a reign of 4 years.86 Funerary monumentedit Sobekneferus tomb has not yet been positively identified. The Northern Mazghuna pyramid is assumed to be her monument. There is however no clear evidence to confirm this assignment8788 and the pyramid may date to a period well after the end of the Twelfth Dynasty.89 Only its substructure was completed construction of the superstructure and wider temple complex was never begun. The passages of the substructure had a complex plan. A stairway descended south from the east side of the pyramid leading to a square chamber which connected to the next sloping passage leading west to a portcullis. The portcullis consisted of a 42000 kilograms 93000 lb quartzite block intended to slide into and block the passage. Beyond the passage wound through several more turns and a second smaller portcullis before terminating at the antechamber. South of this lay the burial chamber which was almost entirely occupied by a quartzite monolith which acted as the vessel for a sarcophagus. In a deep recess lay a quartzite lid which was to be slid into place over the coffin and then locked into place by a stone slab blocking it. The builders had all exposed surfaces painted red and added lines of black paint. A causeway leading to the pyramid was built of mudbrick which must have been used by the workers. Though the burial place had been constructed no burial was interred at the site.8889 A place called Sekhem Sobekneferu is mentioned on a papyrus found at Harageh which may be the name of her pyramid.9091 On a funerary stela from Abydos now in Marseille there is mention of a storeroom administrator of Sobekneferu named Heby. The stela dates to the 
13 th Dynasty and attests to an ongoing funerary cult.9293 See alsoedit Hatshepsut Merneith Neithhotep Statue of Sobekneferu Notesedit  Proposed dates for the reign of Sobekeneferu c. 18051802 BC34 c. 17901786 BC56 c. 17901785 BC7 c. 17871783 BC8 c. 17851782 BC9 c. 17851781 BC10 c. 17771773 BC1112 c. 17631760 BC2 c. 17601755 BC.13 Referencesedit  Schneider 2006 p. 174.  a b Krauss  Warburton 2006 pp. 480  492.
