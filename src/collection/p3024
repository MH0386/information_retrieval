He was a philanthropic ruler and a successful soldieremperor who led the Roman Empire to its greatest territorial extent by the time of his death. He was given the title of Optimus the best by the Roman Senate. Trajan was born in the municipium of Italica in the presentday Andalusian province of Seville in southern Spain an Italic settlement in Hispania Baetica his gens Ulpia came from the town of Tuder in the Umbria region of central Italy. His namesake father Marcus Ulpius Traianus was a general and distinguished senator. Trajan rose to prominence during the reign of Domitian in AD 89 serving as a legatus legionis in Hispania Tarraconensis he supported the emperor against a revolt on the Rhine led by Antonius Saturninus. He then served as governor of Germania and Pannonia. In September 96 Domitian was succeeded by the elderly and childless Nerva who proved to be unpopular with the army. After a revolt by members of the Praetorian Guard Nerva decided to adopt as his heir and successor the more popular Trajan who had distinguished himself in military campaigns against Germanic tribes. As emperor of Rome Trajan oversaw the construction of building projects such as the forum named after him the introduction of social welfare policies such as the alimenta and new military conquests. He annexed Nabataea and Dacia and his war against the Parthian Empire ended with the incorporation of Armenia Mesopotamia and Assyria as Roman provinces. In August AD 117 while sailing back to Rome Trajan fell ill and died of a stroke in the city of Selinus. He was deified by the senate and his successor Hadrian Trajans cousin. According to historical tradition Trajans ashes were entombed in a small room beneath Trajans Column. Sources As an emperor Trajans reputation has endured  he is one of the few rulers whose reputation has survived 19 centuries. Every new emperor after him was honoured by the Senate with the wish felicior Augusto melior Traiano that he be luckier than Augustus and better than Trajan. Among medieval Christian theologians Trajan was considered a virtuous pagan. In the Renaissance Machiavelli speaking on the advantages of adoptive succession over heredity mentioned the five successive good emperors from Nerva to Marcus3  a trope out of which the 
18 thcentury historian Edward Gibbon popularized the notion of the Five Good Emperors of whom Trajan was the second.4 An account of the Dacian Wars the Commentarii de bellis Dacicis written by Trajan himself or a ghostwriter and modelled after Caesars Commentarii de Bello Gallico is lost with the exception of one sentence. Only fragments remain of the Getica a book by Trajans personal physician Titus Statilius Criton. The Parthica a 
17 volume account of the Parthian Wars written by Arrian has met a similar fate.5 Book 68 in Greek author Cassius Dios Roman History which survives mostly as Byzantine abridgements and epitomes is the main source for the political history of Trajans rule.6 Besides this Pliny the Youngers Panegyricus and Dio Chrysostoms orations are the best surviving contemporary sources. Both are adulatory perorations typical of the High Imperial period that describe an idealized monarch and an equally idealized view of Trajans rule and concern themselves more with ideology than with fact.7 The 
10 th volume of Plinys letters contains his correspondence with Trajan which deals with various aspects of imperial Roman government. It is generally agreed that Pliny being part of the emperors inner circle provides a unique and valuable source of information through his letters with Trajan the only surviving correspondence between a governor and his emperor. However it has been argued that Plinys correspondence with Trajan is neither intimate nor candid but rather an exchange of official mail in which Plinys stance borders on the servile. Some authors have even proposed that much of the text was written andor edited by Trajans Imperial secretary his ab epistulis. 891011 Given the scarcity of literary sources discussion of Trajan and his rule in modern historiography cannot avoid speculation. Nonliterary sources such as archaeology epigraphy and numismatics are also useful for reconstructing his reign.12 Early life Ancestors of Trajan Ulpius14 Marcus Ulpius Traianus Traia15 Marcus Ulpius Traianus Quintus Marcius Barea Sura Marcia13 Aulus Antonius Rufus Antonia Furnilla Furnia Gold aureus of Trajan depicting him alongside his namesake father c. AD 115. Marcus Ulpius Traianus was born on 18 September AD 53 in the Roman province of Hispania Baetica16 in what is now Andalusia in modern Spain in the municipium of Italica now in the municipal area of Santiponce in the outskirts of Seville a Roman colony established in 206 BC by Scipio Africanus.171819 At the time of Trajans birth it was a small town without baths theatre and amphitheatre and with a very narrow territory under its direct administration.19 Trajans year of birth is not reliably attested and may instead have been AD 
56.2 0 The epitome of Cassius Dios Roman history describes Trajan as an Iberian and neither an Italian nor even an Italiote but this claim is contradicted by other ancient sources and rejected by modern scholars who have reconstructed Trajans Italic lineage.21222324 Appian states that Trajans hometown of Italica was settled by and named after Italic veterans who fought in Spain under Scipio and new settlers arrived there from Italy in the following centuries. Among the Italic settlers were the Ulpii and the Traii who were either part of the original colonists or arrived as late as the end of the 
1 st century BC.25 Their original home according to the description of Trajan as Ulpius Traianus ex urbe Tudertina in the Epitome de Caesaribus was the town of Tuder Todi in the Umbria region of central Italy.2627 This is confirmed by archeology with epigraphic evidence placing both the Ulpii and the Traii in Umbria generally and Tuder specifically and by linguistic studies of the family names Ulpius and Traius which show that both are of OscoUmbrian origin.28293031 It is unknown whether Trajans ancestors were Roman citizens or not at their arrival in Spain. They would have certainly possessed Roman citizenship in case they arrived after the Social War 9187 BC when Tuder became a municipium of Roman citizens. In Spain they may well have intermarried with native Iberians in which case they would have lost their citizenship. Had they lacked or lost the status of Roman citizens they would have achieved it or recovered it when Italica became a municipium with Latin rights in the mid
1 st century BC. Trajans paternal grandfather Ulpius married a Traia.32 Their son Trajans namesake father Marcus Ulpius Traianus was born at Italica during the reign of Tiberius and became a prominent senator and general commanding the Legio X Fretensis under Vespasian in the First JewishRoman War.3334 Trajans mother was Marcia a Roman noblewoman of the gens Marcia and a sisterinlaw of the second Flavian Emperor Titus.35 Little is known of her. Her father is believed to be Quintus Marcius Barea Sura. Her mother was Antonia Furnilla daughter of Aulus Antonius Rufus and Furnia. Trajan owned some lands called Figlinae Marcianae in Ameria another Umbrian town located near both Tuder and Reate the home of the Flavian dynasty and believed to be the home of Marcias family. The line of the Ulpii continued long after Trajans death. His elder sister was Ulpia Marciana and his niece was Salonia Matidia. Very little is known about Trajans early formative years but it is thought likely that he spent his first months or years in Italica before moving to Rome and then perhaps at around eight or nine years of age he almost certainly would have returned temporarily to Italica with his father during Trajanus governorship of Baetica ca. 64
65.3 6 The lack of a strong local power base caused by the size of the town from which they came made it necessary for the Ulpii and for the Aelii the other important senatorial family of Italica with whom they were allied to weave local alliances in the Baetica with the Annii the Ucubi and perhaps the Dasumii from Corduba the Tarraconense and the Narbonense here above all through Pompeia Plotina Trajans wife.1937 Many of these alliances were made not in Spain but in Rome.37 The family home in Rome the Domus Traiana was on the Aventine Hill excavations under the Piazza del Tempio di Diana found remains thought to be of the familys large suburban villa with evidence of highly decorated rooms.36 Military career Trajan wearing the civic crown and military garb such as a muscle cuirass 
2 nd century AD Antalya Archaeological Museum As a young man Trajan rose through the ranks of the Roman army serving in some of the most contested parts of the empires frontier. In 7677 his father was Governor of Syria Legatus pro praetore Syriae where Trajan himself remained as Tribunus legionis. From there after his fathers replacement he seems to have been transferred to an unspecified Rhine province and Pliny implies that he engaged in active combat duty during both commissions.38 In about 86 Trajans cousin Aelius Afer died leaving his young children Hadrian and Paulina orphans. Trajan and his colleague Publius Acilius Attianus became coguardians of the two children.39 Trajan in his late thirties was created ordinary consul for the year 91. This early appointment may reflect the prominence of his fathers career as his father had been instrumental to the ascent of the ruling Flavian dynasty held consular rank himself and had just been made a patrician.40 Around this time Trajan brought the architect and engineer Apollodorus of Damascus with him to Rome41 and married Pompeia Plotina a noblewoman from the Roman settlement at Nmes the marriage ultimately remained childless.42 The historian Cassius Dio later noted that Trajan was a lover of young men in contrast to the usual bisexual activity that was common among upperclass Roman men of the period. The emperor Julian also made a sardonic reference to his predecessors sexual preference stating that Zeus himself would have had to be on guard had his Ganymede come within Trajans vicinity.43 This distaste reflected a change of mores that began with the Severan dynasty44 Trajans putative lovers included the future emperor Hadrian pages of the imperial household the actor Pylades a dancer called Apolaustus Lucius Licinius Sura and Trajans predecessor Nerva.43 Cassius Dio also relates that Trajan made an ally out of Abgar VII on account of the latters beautiful son Arbandes who would then dance for Trajan at a banquet. The details of Trajans early military career are obscure save for the fact that in 89 as legate of Legio VII Gemina in Hispania Tarraconensis he supported Domitian against an attempted coup by Lucius Antonius Saturninus the governor of Germania Superior.45 Trajan probably remained in the region after the revolt was quashed to engage with the Chatti who had sided with Saturninus before returning the VII Gemina legion to Legio in Hispania Tarraconensis.46 In 91 he held a consulate with Acilius Glabrio a rarity in that neither consul was a member of the ruling dynasty. He held an unspecified consular commission as governor of either Pannonia or Germania Superior or possibly both. Pliny  who seems to deliberately avoid offering details that would stress personal attachment between Trajan and the tyrant Domitian  attributes to him at the time various and unspecified feats of arms.47 Rise to power Bust of Nerva who became emperor following the assassination of Domitian Domitians successor Nerva was unpopular with the army and had been forced by his Praetorian Prefect Casperius Aelianus to execute Domitians killers.48 Nerva needed the armys support to avoid being ousted. He accomplished this in the summer of 97 by naming Trajan as his adoptive son and successor claiming that this was entirely due to Trajans outstanding military merits.47 There are hints however in contemporary literary sources that Trajans adoption was imposed on Nerva. Pliny implied as much when he wrote that although an emperor could not be coerced into doing something if this was the way in which Trajan was raised to power then it was worth it. Alice Knig argues that the notion of a natural continuity between Nervas and Trajans reigns was an ex post facto fiction developed by authors writing under Trajan including Tacitus and Pliny.49 According to the Historia Augusta the future Emperor Hadrian brought word to Trajan of his adoption.41 Trajan retained Hadrian on the Rhine frontier as a military tribune and Hadrian thus became privy to the circle of friends and relations with whom Trajan surrounded himself. Among them was Lucius Licinius Sura a Roman senator born in Spain and the governor of Germania Inferior who was Trajans personal friend and became an official adviser of the Emperor.50 Sura was highly influential and was appointed consul for third term in 1
07.5 15253 Some senators may have resented Suras activities as a kingmaker and minence grise among them the historian Tacitus who acknowledged Suras military and oratorical talents but compared his rapacity and devious ways to those of Vespasians minence grise Licinius Mucianus.54 Sura is said to have informed Hadrian in 108 that he had been chosen as Trajans imperial heir.55 As governor of Upper Germany Germania Superior during Nervas reign Trajan received the impressive title of Germanicus for his skilful management and rule of the volatile Imperial province.56 When Nerva died on 28 January 98 Trajan succeeded to the role of emperor without any outward adverse incident.57 The fact that he chose not to hasten towards Rome but made a lengthy tour of inspection on the Rhine and Danube frontiers may suggest that he was unsure of his position both in Rome and with the armies at the front. Alternatively Trajans keen military mind understood the importance of strengthening the empires frontiers. His vision for future conquests required the diligent improvement of surveillance networks defences and transport along the Danube.58 Prior to his frontier tours Trajan ordered his Prefect Aelianus to attend him in Germany where he was apparently executed forthwith put out of the way59 and his nowvacant post taken by Attius Suburanus.60 Trajans accession therefore could qualify more as a successful coup than an orderly succession.61 Roman emperor Roman imperial dynasties Aureus of Trajan NervaAntonine dynasty AD 96192 Chronology Nerva 9698 Trajan 98117 Hadrian 117138 Antoninus Pius 138161 Lucius Verus 161169 Marcus Aurelius 161180 Commodus 177192 Family NervaAntonine family tree CategoryNervaAntonine dynasty Succession Preceded by Flavian dynasty Followed by Year of the Five Emperors v t e On his entry to Rome Trajan granted the plebs a direct gift of money. The traditional donative to the troops however was reduced by half.62 There remained the issue of the strained relations between the emperor and the Senate especially after the supposed bloodiness that had marked Domitians reign and his dealings with the Curia. By feigning reluctance to hold power Trajan was able to start building a consensus around him in the Senate.63 His belated ceremonial entry into Rome in 99 was notably understated something on which Pliny the Younger elaborated.64 By not openly supporting Domitians preference for equestrian officers65 Trajan appeared to conform to the idea developed by Pliny that an emperor derived his legitimacy from his adherence to traditional hierarchies and senatorial morals.66 Therefore he could point to the allegedly republican character of his rule.67 In a speech at the inauguration of his third consulship on 1 January 100 Trajan exhorted the senate to share the caretaking of the empire with him  an event later celebrated on a coin.6869 In reality Trajan did not share power in any meaningful way with the senate something that Pliny admits candidly Everything depends on the whims of a single man who on behalf of the common welfare has taken upon himself all functions and all tasks.7071 One of the most significant trends of his reign was his encroachment on the senates sphere of authority such as his decision to make the senatorial provinces of Achaea and Bithynia into imperial ones in order to deal with the inordinate spending on public works by local magnates72 and the general mismanagement of provincial affairs by various proconsuls appointed by the Senate.73 Optimus princeps Statue of Trajan posing in military garb in front of the Amphitheatre of Colonia Ulpia Traiana in the Xanten Archaeological Park in modernday Germany In the formula developed by Pliny however Trajan was a good emperor in that by himself he approved or blamed the same things that the Senate would have approved or blamed.74 If in reality Trajan was an autocrat his deferential behavior towards his peers qualified him to be viewed as a virtuous monarch.75 The idea is that Trajan wielded autocratic power through moderatio instead of contumacia  moderation instead of insolence.76 In short according to the ethics for autocracy developed by most political writers of the Imperial Roman Age Trajan was a good ruler in that he ruled less by fear and more by acting as a role model for according to Pliny men learn better from examples.77 Eventually Trajans popularity among his peers was such that the Roman Senate bestowed upon him the honorific of optimus meaning the best7879 which appears on coins from 105 on.80 This title had mostly to do with Trajans role as benefactor such as in the case of his returning confiscated property.81 Pliny states that Trajans ideal role was a conservative one argued as well by the orations of Dio Chrysostomin particular his four Orations on Kingship composed early during Trajans reign. Dio as a Greek notable and intellectual with friends in high places and possibly an official friend to the emperor amicus caesaris saw Trajan as a defender of the status quo.8283 In his third kingship oration Dio describes an ideal king ruling by means of friendship  that is through patronage and a network of local notables who act as mediators between the ruled and the ruler.84 Dios notion of being friend to Trajan or any other Roman emperor however was that of an informal arrangement that involved no formal entry of such friends into the Roman administration.85 Trajan ingratiated himself with the Greek intellectual elite by recalling to Rome many including Dio who had been exiled by Domitian86 and by returning in a process begun by Nerva a great deal of private property that Domitian had confiscated. He also had good dealings with Plutarch who as a notable of Delphi seems to have been favoured by the decisions taken on behalf of his homeplace by one of Trajans legates who had arbitrated a boundary dispute between Delphi and its neighbouring cities.87 However it was clear to Trajan that Greek intellectuals and notables were to be regarded as tools for local administration and not be allowed to fancy themselves in a privileged position.88 As Pliny said in one of his letters at the time it was official policy that Greek civic elites be treated according to their status as notionally free but not put on an equal footing with their Roman rulers.89 When the city of Apamea complained of an audit of its accounts by Pliny alleging its free status as a Roman colony Trajan replied by writing that it was by his own wish that such inspections had been ordered. Concern about independent local political activity is seen in Trajans decision to forbid Nicomedia from having a corps of firemen If people assemble for a common purpose ... they soon turn it into a political society Trajan wrote to Pliny as well as in his and Plinys fears about excessive civic generosities by local notables such as distribution of money or gifts.90 Plinys letters suggest that Trajan and his aides were as much bored as they were alarmed by the claims of Dio and other Greek notables to political influence based on what they saw as their special connection to their Roman overlords.91 Pliny tells of Dio of Prusa placing a statue of Trajan in a building complex where Dios wife and son were buried  therefore incurring a charge of treason for placing the emperors statue near a grave. Trajan however dropped the charge.92 Nevertheless while the office of corrector was intended as a tool to curb any hint of independent political activity among local notables in the Greek cities93 the correctores themselves were all men of the highest social standing entrusted with an exceptional commission. The post seems to have been conceived partly as a reward for senators who had chosen to make a career solely on the emperors behalf. Therefore in reality the post was conceived as a means for taming both Greek notables and Roman senators.94 It must be added that although Trajan was wary of the civic oligarchies in the Greek cities he also admitted into the senate a number of prominent Eastern notables already slated for promotion during Domitians reign by reserving for them one of the twenty posts open each year for minor magistrates the vigintiviri.95 Such must be the case of the Galatian notable and leading member of the Greek community according to one inscription Gaius Julius Severus who was a descendant of several Hellenistic dynasts and client kings.96 Severus was the grandfather of the prominent general Gaius Julius Quadratus Bassus consul in 1
05.9 7 Other prominent Eastern senators included Gaius Julius Alexander Berenicianus a descendant of Herod the Great suffect consul in 1
16.9 8 Trajan created at least fourteen new senators from the Greekspeaking half of the empire an unprecedented recruitment number that opens to question the issue of the traditionally Roman character of his reign as well as the Hellenism of his successor Hadrian.99 But then Trajans new Eastern senators were mostly very powerful and very wealthy men with more than local influence100 and much interconnected by marriage so that many of them were not altogether new to the Senate.101 On the local level among the lower section of the Eastern propertied102 the alienation of most Greek notables and intellectuals towards Roman rule and the fact that the Romans were seen by most such Greek notables as aliens persisted well after Trajans reign.103 One of Trajans senatorial creations from the East the Athenian Gaius Julius Antiochus Epiphanes Philopappos a member of the Royal House of Commagene left behind him a funeral monument on the Mouseion Hill that was later disparagingly described by Pausanias as a monument built to a Syrian man.104 GreekRoman relations Bust of Trajan wearing the Civic Crown Glyptothek Munich As a senatorial Emperor Trajan was inclined to choose his local base of political support from among the members of the ruling urban oligarchies. In the West that meant local senatorial families like his own. In the East that meant the families of Greek notables. The Greeks though had their own memories of independence  and a commonly acknowledged sense of cultural superiority  and instead of seeing themselves as Roman disdained Roman rule.105 What the Greek oligarchies wanted from Rome was above all to be left in peace to be allowed to exert their right to selfgovernment i.e. to be excluded from the provincial government as was Italy and to concentrate on their local interests.106 This was something the Romans were not disposed to do as from their perspective the Greek notables were shunning their responsibilities in regard to the management of Imperial affairs  primarily in failing to keep the common people under control thus creating the need for the Roman governor to intervene.107 An excellent example of this Greek alienation was the personal role played by Dio of Prusa in his relationship with Trajan. Dio is described by Philostratus as Trajans close friend and Trajan as supposedly engaging publicly in conversations with Dio.108 Nevertheless as a Greek local magnate with a taste for costly building projects and pretensions of being an important political agent for Rome109 Dio of Prusa was actually a target for one of Trajans authoritarian innovations the appointing of imperial correctores to audit the civic finances110 of the technically free Greek cities.111 The main goal was to curb the overenthusiastic spending on public works that served to channel ancient rivalries between neighbouring cities. As Pliny wrote to Trajan this had as its most visible consequence a trail of unfinished or illkept public utilities.112 Competition among Greek cities and their ruling oligarchies was mainly for marks of preeminence especially for titles bestowed by the Roman emperor. Such titles were ordered in a ranking system that determined how the cities were to be outwardly treated by Rome.113 The usual form that such rivalries took was that of grandiose building plans giving the cities the opportunity to vie with each other over extravagant needless ... structures that would make a show.114 A side effect of such extravagant spending was that junior and thus less wealthy members of the local oligarchies felt disinclined to present themselves to fill posts as local magistrates positions that involved everincreasing personal expense.115 Roman authorities liked to play the Greek cities against one another116  something of which Dio of Prusa was fully aware By their public acts the Roman governors have branded you as a pack of fools yes they treat you just like children for we often offer children the most trivial things in place of things of greatest worth ... In place of justice in place of the freedom of the cities from spoliation or from the seizure of the private possessions of their inhabitants in place of their refraining from insulting you ... your governors hand you titles and call you first either by word of mouth or in writing that done they may thenceforth with impunity treat you as being the very last117118 These same Roman authorities had also an interest in assuring the cities solvency and therefore ready collection of Imperial taxes.119 Last but not least inordinate spending on civic buildings was not only a means to achieve local superiority but also a means for the local Greek elites to maintain a separate cultural identity  something expressed in the contemporary rise of the Second Sophistic this cultural patriotism acted as a kind of substitute for the loss of political independence120 and as such was shunned by Roman authorities.121 As Trajan himself wrote to Pliny These poor Greeks all love a gymnasium ... they will have to content with one that suits their real needs.122 The first known corrector was charged with a commission to deal with the situation of the free cities as it was felt that the old method of ad hoc intervention by the Emperor andor the proconsuls had not been enough to curb the pretensions of the Greek notables.123 It is noteworthy that an embassy from Dios city of Prusa was not favourably received by Trajan124 and that this had to do with Dios chief objective which was to elevate Prusa to the status of a free city an independent citystate exempt from paying taxes to Rome.125 Eventually Dio gained for Prusa the right to become the head of the assizedistrict conventus meaning that Prusans did not have to travel to be judged by the Roman governor but eleutheria freedom in the sense of full political autonomy was denied.126 Eventually it fell to Pliny as imperial governor of Bithynia in 110 AD to deal with the consequences of the financial mess wrought by Dio and his fellow civic officials.127 Its well established that the cities finances are in a state of disorder Pliny once wrote to Trajan plans for unnecessary works made in collusion with local contractors being identified as one of the main problems.128 One of the compensatory measures proposed by Pliny expressed a thoroughly Roman conservative position as the cities financial solvency depended on the councilmens purses it was necessary to have more councilmen on the local city councils. According to Pliny the best way to achieve this was to lower the minimum age for holding a seat on the council making it possible for more sons of the established oligarchical families to join and thus contribute to civic spending this was seen as preferable to enrolling nonnoble wealthy upstarts.129 Such an increase in the number of council members was granted to Dios city of Prusa to the dismay of existing councilmen who felt their status lowered.130 A similar situation existed in Claudiopolis where a public bath was built with the proceeds from the entrance fees paid by supernumerary members of the council enrolled with Trajans permission.131 According to the Digest Trajan decreed that when a city magistrate promised to achieve a particular public building his heirs inherited responsibility for its completion.132 Building projects Supporting piers of Trajans Bridge on the right bank of the Danube in modern Serbia. Its wooden superstructure was dismantled by Hadrian presumably to reduce the threat of invasion from the north.133 Trajan was a prolific builder. Many of his buildings were designed and erected by the gifted architect Apollodorus of Damascus including a massive bridge over the Danube which the Roman army and its reinforcements could use regardless of weather the Danube sometimes froze over in winter but seldom enough to bear the passage of a party of soldiers.134 Trajans works at the Iron Gates region of the Danube created or enlarged the boardwalk road cut into the cliffface along the Iron Gates gorge.135 A canal was built between the Danubes Kasajna tributary and Ducis Pratum circumventing rapids and cataracts.136 Trajans Forum Traiani was Romes largest forum. It was built to commemorate his victories in Dacia and was largely financed from that campaigns loot.137 To accommodate it parts of the Capitoline and Quirinal Hills had to be removed the latter enlarging a clear area first established by Domitian. Apollodorus of Damascus magnificent design incorporated a Triumphal arch entrance a forum space approximately 120 m long and 
90 m wide surrounded by peristyles a monumentally sized basilica and later Trajans Column and libraries. It was started in 107 AD dedicated on 1 January 112 and remained in use for at least 500 years. It still drew admiration when Emperor Constantius II visited Rome in the fourth century.137 It accommodated Trajans Market and an adjacent brick market.138139 Trajan was also a prolific builder of triumphal arches many of which survive. He built roads such as the Via Traiana an extension of the Via Appia from Beneventum to Brundisium140 and the Via Traiana Nova a mostly military road between Damascus and Aila which Rome employed in its annexation of Nabataea and founding of Arabia Province.141 Emperor Trajan in Pharonic aspect with hieroglyph name  making offerings to Egyptian Gods on the Roman Mammisi at the Dendera Temple complex Egypt.142143 Some historians attribute the construction or reconstruction of Old Cairos Roman fortress also known as Babylon Fort to Trajan and the building of a canal between the River Nile and the Red Sea.144 In Egypt Trajan was quite active in constructing and embellishing buildings. He is portrayed together with Domitian on the propylon of the Temple of Hathor at Dendera. His cartouche also appears in the column shafts of the Temple of Khnum at Esna.142 He built palatial villas outside Rome at Arcinazzo at Centumcellae and at Talamone. Games Trajan invested heavily in the provision of popular amusements. He carried out a massive reconstruction of the Circus Maximus which was already the empires biggest and best appointed circuit for the immensely popular sport of chariot racing. The Circus also hosted religious theatrical spectacles and games and public processions on a grand scale. Trajans reconstruction completed by 103 was modestly described by Trajan himself as adequate for the Roman people. It replaced flammable wooden seating tiers with stone and increased the Circus already vast capacity by about 5000 seats. Its lofty elevated Imperial viewing box was rebuilt among the seating tiers so that spectators could see their emperor sharing their enjoyment of the races alongside his family and images of the gods145 At some time during 108 or 109 Trajan held 123 days of games to celebrate his Dacian victory. They involved fully 10000 gladiators and the slaughter of thousands possibly tens of thousands of animals both wild and domestic.146 Trajans careful management of public spectacles led the orator Fronto to congratulate him for paying equal attention to public entertainments and more serious issues acknowledging that neglect of serious matters can cause greater damage but neglect of amusements greater discontent.147 Statefunded public entertainments helped to maintain contentment among the populace the more serious matter of the corn dole aimed to satisfy individuals.148 Christians In red Christian communities in the Roman Empire under Emperor Trajan. During the period of peace that followed the Dacian war Trajan exchanged letters with Pliny the Younger on how best to deal with the Christians of Pontus. Trajan told Pliny to continue prosecutions of Christians if they merited that but not to accept anonymous or malicious denunciations. He considered this to be in the interests of justice and to reflect the spirit of the age. Noncitizens who admitted to being Christians and refused to recant were to be executed for obstinacy. Citizens were sent to Rome for trial.149 Further tests faced by Christians in Pontus are alluded to in correspondence between Pliny the Younger governor of the Roman province of Bithynia and Pontus and Emperor Trajan. Writing from Pontus in about 112 C.E. Pliny reported that the contagion of Christianity threatened everyone regardless of gender age or rank. Pliny gave those accused of being Christians opportunity to deny it and those who would not he executed. Any who cursed Christ or recited a prayer to the gods or to Trajans statue were released. Pliny acknowledged that these were things that those who are really Christians cannot be made to do. Currency and welfare See also Alimenta In 107 Trajan devalued the Roman currency decreasing the silver content of the denarius from 
93.5  to 
89.0   the actual silver weight dropping from 
3.0 4 grams to 
2.8 8 grams.150 This devaluation along with the massive amounts of gold and silver acquired through his Dacian wars allowed Trajan to mint many more denarii than his predecessors. He also withdrew from circulation silver denarii minted before Neros devaluation. Trajans devaluation may have had a political intent enabling planned increases in civil and military spending.151 Trajan formalised the alimenta a welfare program that helped orphans and poor children throughout Italy by providing cash food and subsidized education. The program was supported out of Dacian War booty estate taxes and philanthropy.152 The alimenta also relied indirectly on mortgages secured against Italian farms fundi. Registered landowners received a lump sum from the imperial treasury and in return were expected to repay an annual sum to support the alimentary fund.153 Military campaigns Conquest of Dacia Main article Trajans Dacian Wars Trajans Column Rome Trajan took the Roman empire to its greatest expanse. The earliest conquests were Romes two wars against Dacia an area that had troubled Roman politics for over a decade in regard to the unstable peace negotiated by Domitians ministers with the powerful Dacian king Decebalus.154 Dacia would be reduced by Trajans Rome to a client kingdom in the first war 101102 followed by a second war that ended in actual incorporation into the Empire of the transDanube border group of Dacia.154 According to the provisions of Decebaluss earlier treaty with Rome made in the time of Domitian Decebalus was acknowledged as rex amicus that is client king in exchange for accepting client status he received from Rome both a generous stipend and a steady supply of technical experts.155 The treaty seems to have allowed Roman troops the right of passage through the Dacian kingdom in order to attack the Marcomanni Quadi and Sarmatians. However senatorial opinion never forgave Domitian for paying what was seen as tribute to a barbarian king.156 Unlike the Germanic tribes the Dacian kingdom was an organized state capable of developing alliances of its own157 thus making it a strategic threat and giving Trajan a strong motive to attack it.158 In May of 101 Trajan launched his first campaign into the Dacian kingdom159 crossing to the northern bank of the Danube and defeating the Dacian army at Tapae see Second Battle of Tapae near the Iron Gates of Transylvania. It was not a decisive victory however.160 Trajans troops took heavy losses in the encounter and he put off further campaigning for the year in order to regroup and reinforce his army.161 Nevertheless the battle was considered a Roman victory and Trajan strived to ultimately consolidate his position including other major engagements as well as the capture of Decebalus sister as depicted on Trajans Column.162 The following winter Decebalus took the initiative by launching a counterattack across the Danube further downstream supported by Sarmatian cavalry163 forcing Trajan to come to the aid of the troops in his rearguard. The Dacians and their allies were repulsed after two battles in Moesia at Nicopolis ad Istrum and Adamclisi.164 Trajans army then advanced further into Dacian territory and a year later forced Decebalus to submit. He had to renounce claim to some regions of his kingdom return runaways from Rome then under his protection most of them technical experts and surrender all his war machines.165 Trajan returned to Rome in triumph and was granted the title Dacicus.166 The peace of 102 had returned Decebalus to the condition of more or less harmless client king however he soon began to rearm to again harbour Roman runaways and to pressure his Western neighbours the Iazyges Sarmatians into allying themselves with him. Through his efforts to develop an antiRoman bloc Decebalus prevented Trajan from treating Dacia as a protectorate instead of an outright conquest.167 In 104 Decebalus devised an attempt on Trajans life by means of some Roman deserters a plan that failed. Decebalus also took prisoner Trajans legate Longinus who eventually poisoned himself while in custody. Finally in 105 Decebalus undertook an invasion of Romanoccupied territory north of the Danube.168169 Portrait of King Decebalus in the Cartea omului matur 1919 Prior to the campaign Trajan had raised two entirely new legions II Traiana  which however may have been posted in the East at the Syrian port of Laodicea  and XXX Ulpia Victrix which was posted to Brigetio in Pannonia.168170 By 105 the concentration of Roman troops assembled in the middle and lower Danube amounted to fourteen legions up from nine in 101  about half of the entire Roman army.171 Even after the Dacian wars the Danube frontier would permanently replace the Rhine as the main military axis of the Roman Empire.172 Including auxiliaries the number of Roman troops engaged on both campaigns was between 150000 and 175000 while Decebalus could dispose of up to 2000
00.1 60 Other estimates for the Roman forces involved in Trajans second Dacian War cite around 86000 for active campaigning with large reserves retained in the proximal provinces and potentially much lower numbers around 50000 for Decebalus depleted forces and absent allies.173 In a fierce campaign that seems to have consisted mostly of static warfare the Dacians devoid of manoeuvring room kept to their network of fortresses which the Romans sought systematically to storm174 see also Second Dacian War. The Romans gradually tightened their grip around Decebalus stronghold in Sarmizegetusa Regia172 which they finally took and destroyed. A controversial scene on Trajans column just before the fall of Sarmizegetusa Regia suggests that Decebalus may have offered poison to his remaining men as an alternative option to capture or death while trying to flee the besieged capital with him.173 Decebalus fled but when later cornered by Roman cavalry committed suicide. His severed head brought to Trajan by the cavalryman Tiberius Claudius Maximus175 was later exhibited in Rome on the steps leading up to the Capitol and thrown on the Gemonian stairs.176 The famous Dacian treasures were not found in the captured capital and their whereabouts were only revealed when a Dacian nobleman called Bikilis was captured. Decebalus treasures had been buried under a temporarily diverted river and the captive workers executed to retain the secret. Staggering amounts of gold and silver were found and packed off to fill Romes coffers.173 The amphitheater at Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa Trajan built a new city Colonia Ulpia Traiana Augusta Dacica Sarmizegetusa on another site north of the hill citadel holding the previous Dacian capital177 although bearing the same full name Sarmizegetusa. This capital city was conceived as a purely civilian administrative centre and was provided the usual Romanized administrative apparatus decurions aediles etc..178 Urban life in Roman Dacia seems to have been restricted to Roman colonists mostly military veterans179 there is no extant evidence for the existence in the province of peregrine cities. Native Dacians continued to live in scattered rural settlements according to their own ways.180 In another arrangement with no parallels in any other Roman province the existing quasiurban Dacian settlements disappeared after the Roman conquest.181 A number of unorganized urban settlements vici developed around military encampments in Dacia proper  the most important being Apulum  but were only acknowledged as cities proper well after Trajans reign.182 The main regional effort of urbanization was concentrated by Trajan at the rearguard in Moesia where he created the new cities of Nicopolis ad Istrum and Marcianopolis. A vicus was also created around the Tropaeum Traianum.183 The garrison city of Oescus received the status of Roman colony after its legionary garrison was redeployed.183 The fact that these former Danubian outposts had ceased to be frontier bases and were now in the deep rear acted as an inducement to their urbanization and development.184 Not all of Dacia was permanently occupied. After the postTrajanic evacuation of lands across the lower Danube185 land extending from the Danube to the inner arch of the Carpathian Mountains including Transylvania the Metaliferi Mountains and Oltenia was absorbed into the Roman province which eventually took the form of an excrescence with illdefined limits stretching from the Danube northwards to the Carpathians.172 This may have been intended as a basis for further expansion within Eastern Europe as the Romans believed the region to be much more geographically flattened and thus easier to traverse than it actually was they also underestimated the distance from those vaguely defined borders to the ocean.186 Modern statue of Trajan at Tower Hill London Defence of the province was entrusted to a single legion the XIII Gemina stationed at Apulum which functioned as an advance guard that could in case of need strike either west or east at the Sarmatians living at the borders.184 Therefore the indefensible character of the province did not appear to be a problem for Trajan as the province was conceived more as a sallybase for further attacks.187 Even in the absence of further Roman expansion the value of the province depended on Roman overall strength while Rome was strong the Dacian salient was an instrument of military and diplomatic control over the Danubian lands when Rome was weak as during the Crisis of the Third Century the province became a liability and was eventually abandoned.188 Trajan resettled Dacia with Romans and annexed it as a province of the Roman Empire. Aside from their enormous booty over half a million slaves according to John Lydus189 Trajans Dacian campaigns benefited the Empires finances through the acquisition of Dacias gold mines managed by an imperial procurator of equestrian rank procurator aurariarum.190 On the other hand commercial agricultural exploitation on the villa model based on the centralized management of a huge landed estate by a single owner fundus was poorly developed.191 Therefore use of slave labor in the province itself seems to have been relatively undeveloped and epigraphic evidence points to work in the gold mines being conducted by means of labor contracts locatio conductio rei and seasonal wageearning.192 The victory was commemorated by the construction both of the 102 cenotaph generally known as the Tropaeum Traiani in Moesia as well of the much later 113 Trajans Column in Rome the latter depicting in stone carved basreliefs the Dacian Wars most important moments.193 Nabataean annexation In 106 Rabbel II Soter one of Romes client kings died. This event might have prompted the annexation of the Nabataean Kingdom but the manner and the formal reasons for the annexation are unclear. Some epigraphic evidence suggests a military operation with forces from Syria and Egypt. What is known is that by 107 Roman legions were stationed in the area around Petra and Bosra as is shown by a papyrus found in Egypt. The furthest south the Romans occupied or better garrisoned adopting a policy of having garrisons at key points in the desert194 was Hegra over 300 kilometres 190 mi southwest of Petra.195 The empire gained what became the province of Arabia Petraea modern southern Jordan and northwest Saudi Arabia.196 At this time a Roman road Via Traiana Nova was built from Aila now Aqaba in Limes Arabicus to Bosrah.197 As Nabataea was the last client kingdom in Asia west of the Euphrates the annexation meant that the entire Roman East had been provincialized completing a trend towards direct rule that had begun under the Flavians.194 Parthian campaign Main article Trajans Parthian campaign Anatolia western Caucasus and northern Levant under Trajan In 113 Trajan embarked on his last campaign provoked by Parthias decision to put an unacceptable king on the throne of Armenia a kingdom over which the two great empires had shared hegemony since the time of Nero some fifty years earlier. Trajan already in Syria early in 113 consistently refused to accept diplomatic approaches from the Parthians intended to settle the Armenian imbroglio peacefully.198 As the surviving literary accounts of Trajans Parthian War are fragmentary and scattered199 it is difficult to assign them a proper context something that has led to a longrunning controversy about its precise happenings and ultimate aims. Cause of the war Modern historians advance the possibility that Trajans decision to wage war against Parthia had economic motives after Trajans annexation of Arabia he built a new road Via Traiana Nova that went from Bostra to Aila on the Red Sea.200 That meant that Charax on the Persian Gulf was the sole remaining western terminus of the Indian trade route outside direct Roman control201 and such control was important in order to lower import prices and to limit the supposed drain of precious metals created by the deficit in Roman trade with the Far East.202 That Charax traded with the Roman Empire there can be no doubt as its actual connections with merchants from Palmyra during the period are well documented in a contemporary Palmyrene epigraph which tells of various Palmyrene citizens honoured for holding office in Charax.203 Also Charaxs rulers domains at the time possibly included the Bahrain islands which offered the possibility of extending Roman hegemony into the Persian Gulf itself.204 A Palmyrene citizen held office as satrap over the islands shortly after Trajans death205 though the appointment was made by a Parthian king of Charax.206 The rationale behind Trajans campaign in this case was one of breaking down a system of Far Eastern trade through small Semitic Arab cities under Parthias control and to put it under Roman control instead.207 Aureus issued by Trajan to celebrate the conquest of Parthia. Inscription IMP. CAES. NER. TRAIAN. OPTIM. AVG. GER. DAC. PARTHICO  P. M. TR. P. CONS. VI P. P. S.P.Q.R.  PARTHIA CAPTA In his Dacian conquests Trajan had already resorted to Syrian auxiliary units whose veterans along with Syrian traders had an important role in the subsequent colonization of Dacia.208 He had recruited Palmyrene units into his army including a camel unit209 therefore apparently procuring Palmyrene support to his ultimate goal of annexing Charax. It has even been ventured that when earlier in his campaign Trajan annexed Armenia he was bound to annex the whole of Mesopotamia lest the Parthians interrupt the flux of trade from the Persian Gulf andor foment trouble at the Roman frontier on the Danube.210 Other historians reject these motives as the supposed Parthian control over the maritime Far Eastern trade route was at best conjectural and based on a selective reading of Chinese sources  trade by land through Parthia seems to have been unhampered by Parthian authorities and left solely to the devices of private enterprise.211 Commercial activity in second century Mesopotamia seems to have been a general phenomenon shared by many peoples within and without the Roman Empire with no sign of a concerted Imperial policy towards it.212 As in the case of the alimenta scholars like Moses Finley and Paul Veyne have considered the idea that a foreign trade policy underlay Trajans war to be anachronistic according to these scholars the concern of Roman leaders with the trade in far eastern luxuries  besides collecting toll taxes and customs213  was moral in nature because contemporary Roman mores frowned upon the softness of luxuries.214215 In the absence of conclusive evidence trade between Rome and India might have been far more balanced in terms of quantities of precious metals exchanged one of our sources for the notion of the Roman gold drain  Plinys the Youngers uncle Pliny the Elder  had earlier described the Gangetic Plains as one of the gold sources for the Roman Empire.216 Accordingly  in a controversial book on the Roman economy  Finley considers Trajans badly miscalculated and expensive assault on Parthia to be an example of the many Roman commercial wars that had in common the fact of existing only in the books of modern historians.212 Trajan the Palladium white marble statue at Naples Archeological Museum late 
1 st century AD The alternative view is to see the campaign as triggered by the lure of territorial annexation and prestige212 the sole motive ascribed by Cassius Dio.217 As far as territorial conquest involved taxcollecting218 especially of the 25 tax levied on all goods entering the Roman Empire the tetarte one can say that Trajans Parthian War had an economic motive.219 Also there was the propaganda value of an Eastern conquest that would emulate in Roman fashion those of Alexander the Great.220 The fact that emissaries from the Kushan Empire might have attended to the commemorative ceremonies for the Dacian War may have kindled in some GrecoRoman intellectuals like Plutarch  who wrote about only 70000 Roman soldiers being necessary to a conquest of Indiacitation needed  as well as in Trajans closer associates speculative dreams about the booty to be obtained by reproducing Macedonian Eastern conquests.221 There could also be Trajans idea to use an ambitious blueprint of conquests as a way to emphasize quasidivine status such as with his cultivated association in coins and monuments to Hercules.222 Also it is possible that the attachment of Trajan to an expansionist policy was supported by a powerful circle of conservative senators from Hispania committed to a policy of imperial expansion first among them being the allpowerful Licinius Sura.223 Alternatively one can explain the campaign by the fact that for the Romans their empire was in principle unlimited and that Trajan only took advantage of an opportunity to make idea and reality coincide.224 Finally there are other modern historians who think that Trajans original aims were purely military and strategic to assure a more defensible Eastern frontier for the Roman Empire crossing Northern Mesopotamia along the course of the Khabur River in order to offer cover to a Roman Armenia.225226 This interpretation is backed by the fact that all subsequent Roman wars against Parthia would aim at establishing a Roman presence deep into Parthia itself.227 It is possible that during the onset of Trajans military experience as a young tribune he had witnessed engagement with the Parthians so any strategic vision was grounded in a tactical awareness of what was needed to tackle Parthia.226 Course of the war An 116 AD inscription of the Legio IV Scythica found near the Armenian capital Artaxata mentioning Trajan.228 The campaign was carefully planned in advance ten legions were concentrated in the Eastern theatre since 111 the correspondence of Pliny the Younger witnesses to the fact that provincial authorities in Bithynia had to organize supplies for passing troops and local city councils and their individual members had to shoulder part of the increased expenses by supplying troops themselves.229 The intended campaign therefore was immensely costly from its very beginning.230 Trajan marched first on Armenia deposed the Parthianappointed king Parthamasiris who was afterwards murdered while kept in the custody of Roman troops in an unclear incident later described by Fronto as a breach of Roman good faith231 and annexed it to the Roman Empire as a province receiving in passing the acknowledgement of Roman hegemony by various tribes in the Caucasus and on the Eastern coast of the Black Sea  a process that kept him busy until the end of 1
14.2 32 At the same time a Roman column under the legate Lusius Quietus  an outstanding cavalry general233 who had signalled himself during the Dacian Wars by commanding a unit from his native Mauretania234  crossed the Araxes river from Armenia into Media Atropatene and the land of the Mardians presentday Ghilan.235 It is possible that Quietus campaign had as its goal the extending of the newer more defensible Roman border eastwards towards the Caspian Sea and northwards to the foothills of the Caucasus.236 This newer more rational frontier depended however on an increased permanent Roman presence east of the Euphrates.237 Sestertius during 116 to commemorate Trajans Parthian victories.

REDACTAE put under the authority of the Roman People  S. C. Senatus Consultus issued by the Senate. The chronology of subsequent events is uncertain but it is generally believed that early in 115 Trajan launched a Mesopotamian campaign marching down towards the Taurus mountains in order to consolidate territory between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. He placed permanent garrisons along the way to secure the territory.238 While Trajan moved from west to east Lusius Quietus moved with his army from the Caspian Sea towards the west both armies performing a successful pincer movement239 whose apparent result was to establish a Roman presence into the Parthian Empire proper with Trajan taking the northern Mesopotamian cities of Nisibis and Batnae and organizing a province of Mesopotamia including the Kingdom of Osrhoene  where King Abgar VII submitted to Trajan publicly240  as a Roman protectorate.241 This process seems to have been completed at the beginning of 116 when coins were issued announcing that Armenia and Mesopotamia had been put under the authority of the Roman people.242 The area between the Khabur River and the mountains around Singara seems to have been considered as the new frontier and as such received a road surrounded by fortresses.243 After wintering in Antioch during 115116  and according to literary sources barely escaping from a violent earthquake that claimed the life of one of the consuls Marcus Pedo Virgilianus244245  Trajan again took to the field in 116 with a view to the conquest of the whole of Mesopotamia an overambitious goal that eventually backfired on the results of his entire campaign. According to some modern historians the aim of the campaign of 116 was to achieve a preemptive demonstration aiming not toward the conquest of Parthia but for tighter Roman control over the Eastern trade route. However the overall scarcity of manpower for the Roman military establishment meant that the campaign was doomed from the start.246 It is noteworthy that no new legions were raised by Trajan before the Parthian campaign maybe because the sources of new citizen recruits were already overexploited.247 As far as the sources allow a description of this campaign it seems that one Roman division crossed the Tigris into Adiabene sweeping south and capturing Adenystrae a second followed the river south capturing Babylon Trajan himself sailed down the Euphrates from DuraEuropos  where a triumphal arch was erected in his honour  through Ozogardana where he erected a tribunal still to be seen at the time of Julian the Apostates campaigns in the same area. Having come to the narrow strip of land between the Euphrates and the Tigris he then dragged his fleet overland into the Tigris capturing Seleucia and finally the Parthian capital of Ctesiphon.248249 He continued southward to the Persian Gulf when after escaping with his fleet a tidal bore on the Tigris250 he received the submission of Athambelus the ruler of Charax. He declared Babylon a new province of the Empire and had his statue erected on the shore of the Persian Gulf251 after which he sent the Senate a laurelled letter declaring the war to be at a close and bemoaning that he was too old to go on any further and repeat the conquests of Alexander the Great.241 Since Charax was a de facto independent kingdom whose connections to Palmyra were described above Trajans bid for the Persian Gulf may have coincided with Palmyrene interests in the region.252 Another hypothesis is that the rulers of Charax had expansionist designs on Parthian Babylon giving them a rationale for alliance with Trajan.253 The Parthian city of Susa was apparently also occupied by the Romans.254 A coin of Trajan found together with coins of the Kushan ruler Kanishka at the Ahin Posh Buddhist Monastery Afghanistan. Caption IMP. CAES. NER. TRAIANO OPTIMO AVG. GER. DAC. According to late literary sources not backed by numismatic or inscriptional evidence a province of Assyria was also proclaimed255 apparently covering the territory of Adiabene.256 Some measures seem to have been considered regarding the fiscal administration of Indian trade  or simply about the payment of customs portoria on goods traded on the Euphrates and Tigris.257252 It is possible that it was this streamlining of the administration of the newly conquered lands according to the standard pattern of Roman provincial administration in tax collecting requisitions and the handling of local potentates prerogatives that triggered later resistance against Trajan.258 According to some modern historians Trajan might have busied himself during his stay on the Persian Gulf with ordering raids on the Parthian coasts259 as well as probing into extending Roman suzerainty over the mountaineer tribes holding the passes across the Zagros Mountains into the Iranian plateau eastward as well as establishing some sort of direct contact between Rome and the Kushan Empire.260 No attempt was made to expand into the Iranian Plateau itself where the Roman army with its relative weakness in cavalry would have been at a disadvantage.261 Trajan left the Persian Gulf for Babylon  where he intended to offer sacrifice to Alexander in the house where he had died in 323 BC262  But a revolt led by Sanatruces a nephew of the Parthian king Osroes I who had retained a cavalry force possibly strengthened by the addition of Saka archers263 imperilled Roman positions in Mesopotamia and Armenia. Trajan sought to deal with this by forsaking direct Roman rule in Parthia proper at least partially.264 Trajan sent two armies towards Northern Mesopotamia the first under Lusius Quietus recovered Nisibis and Edessa from the rebels probably having King Abgarus deposed and killed in the process264 with Quietus probably earning the right to receive the honors of a senator of praetorian rank adlectus inter praetorios.265 The second army however under Appius Maximus Santra probably a governor of Macedonia was defeated and Santra killed.266 Later in 116 Trajan with the assistance of Quietus and two other legates Marcus Erucius Clarus and Tiberius Julius Alexander Julianus267266 defeated a Parthian army in a battle where Sanatruces was killed possibly with the assistance of Osroes son and Sanatruces cousin Parthamaspates whom Trajan wooed successfully.268 After retaking and burning Seleucia Trajan then formally deposed Osroes putting Parthamaspates on the throne as client ruler. This event was commemorated in a coin as the reduction of Parthia to client kingdom status REX PARTHIS DATUS a king is given to the Parthians.269 That done Trajan retreated north in order to retain what he could of the new provinces of Armenia  where he had already accepted an armistice in exchange for surrendering part of the territory to Sanatruces son Vologeses270  and Mesopotamia. It was at this point that Trajans health started to fail him. The fortress city of Hatra on the Tigris in his rear continued to hold out against repeated Roman assaults. He was personally present at the siege and it is possible that he suffered a heat stroke while in the blazing heat.264 Kitos War Main article Kitos War Statue of Trajan Luna marble and Proconessian marble 
2 nd century AD from Ostia Antica Shortly afterwards the Jews inside the Eastern Roman Empire in Egypt Cyprus and Cyrene  this last province being probably the original trouble hotspot  rose up in what probably was an outburst of religious rebellion against the local pagans this widespread rebellion being afterwards named the Kitos War.271 Another rebellion flared up among the Jewish communities of Northern Mesopotamia probably part of a general reaction against Roman occupation.272 Trajan was forced to withdraw his army in order to put down the revolts. He saw this withdrawal as simply a temporary setback but he was destined never to command an army in the field again turning his Eastern armies over to Lusius Quietus who meanwhile early 117 had been made governor of Judaea and might have had to deal earlier with some kind of Jewish unrest in the province.273 Quietus discharged his commissions successfully so much that the war was afterward named after him  Kitus being a corruption of Quietus.274 Whether or not the Kitos War theatre included Judea proper or only the Jewish Eastern diaspora remains doubtful in the absence of clear epigraphic and archaeological evidence. What is certain is that there was an increased Roman military presence in Judea at the time.275 Quietus was promised a consulate276 in the following year 118 for his victories but he was killed before this could occur during the bloody purge that opened Hadrians reign in which Quietus and three other former consuls were sentenced to death after being tried on a vague charge of conspiracy by the secret court of the Praetorian Prefect Attianus.277 It has been thought that Quietus and his colleagues were executed on Hadrians direct orders for fear of their popular standing with the army and their close connections to Trajan.270278 In contrast the next prominent Roman figure in charge of the repression of the Jewish revolt the equestrian Quintus Marcius Turbo who had dealt with the rebel leader from Cyrene Loukuas retained Hadrians trust eventually becoming his Praetorian Prefect.279 As all four consulars were senators of the highest standing and as such generally regarded as able to take imperial power capaces imperii Hadrian seems to have decided to forestall these prospective rivals.280 Death and succession Early in 117 Trajan grew ill and set sail for Italy. His health declined throughout the spring and summer of 117 possibly acknowledged to the public by the display of a bronze portraitbust at the public baths of Ancyra showing an aged and emaciated man though the identification with Trajan is disputed.281282 He reached Selinusa where he suddenly died on or shortly before 11 August.287 Trajan in person could have lawfully nominated Hadrian as his successor but Dio claims that Trajans wife Pompeia Plotina assured Hadrians succession by keeping Trajans death a secret long enough for her to produce and sign a document attesting to Hadrians adoption as son and successor. Dio who tells this narrative offers his father  the governor of Cilicia Apronianus  as a source so his narrative may be based on contemporary rumour. It may also reflect male Roman displeasure that an empress  let alone any woman  could presume to meddle in Romes political affairs.288 Hadrian held an ambiguous position during Trajans reign. After commanding Legio I Minervia during the Dacian Wars he had been relieved from frontline duties at the decisive stage of the Second Dacian War being sent to govern the newly created province of Pannonia Inferior. He had pursued a senatorial career without particular distinction and had not been officially adopted by Trajan although he received from him decorations and other marks of distinction that made him hope for the succession.289290 He received no post after his 108 consulate and no further honours other than being made Archon eponymos for Athens in 1111
12.2 91292 He probably did not take part in the Parthian War. Literary sources relate that Trajan had considered others such as the jurist Lucius Neratius Priscus as heir.293 Hadrian who was eventually entrusted with the governorship of Syria at the time of Trajans death was Trajans cousin and was married to Trajans grandniece which all made him as good as heir designate.294295 Hadrian seems to have been well connected to the powerful and influential coterie of Spanish senators at Trajans court through his ties to Plotina and the Prefect Attianus.296 His refusal to sustain Trajans senatorial and expansionist policy during his own reign may account for the crass hostility shown him by literary sources.297 Hadrians first major act as emperor was to abandon Mesopotamia as too costly and distant to defend and to restore Armenia and Osrhoene to Parthian hegemony under Romes suzerainty.167 The Parthian campaign had been an enormous setback to Trajans policy proof that Rome had overstretched its capacity to sustain an ambitious program of conquest. According to the Historia Augusta Hadrian claimed to follow the precedent set by Cato the Elder towards the Macedonians who were to be set free because they could not be protected  something Birley sees as an unconvincing precedent. 298257 Other territories conquered by Trajan were retained.299300 According to a wellestablished historical tradition Trajans ashes were placed within the small cella that still survives at the base of Trajans column. In some modern scholarship his ashes were more likely interred near his column in a mausoleum temple or tomb built for his cult as a divus of the Roman state.301302 Legacy Bust of Trajan in AD 108  in the Museum of Art History in Vienna Austria Ancient sources on Trajans personality and accomplishments are unanimously positive. Pliny the Younger for example celebrates Trajan in his panegyric as a wise and just emperor and a moral man. Cassius Dio added that he always remained dignified and fair.303 A thirdcentury emperor Decius even received from the Senate the name Trajan as a decoration.304 After the setbacks of the third century Trajan together with Augustus became in the Later Roman Empire the paragon of the most positive traits of the Imperial order.305 Many emperors after Trajan would when they were sworn into office be wished Felicior Augusto Melior Traiano May you be more fortunate than Augustus and better than Trajan.306 The fourthcentury emperor Constantine I is credited with calling him a plant upon every wall for the many buildings bearing inscriptions with his name.307308 Iconography The head of this statue was reworked with a beard in the 
3 rd century for the theater of Perge. Now at the Antalya Museum in Turkey. All Roman emperors until Trajan except Nero who occasionally wore sideburns were depicted cleanshaven according to the fashion introduced among the Romans by Scipio Africanus 236  183 BC. This Imperial fashion was changed by Trajans successor Hadrian who made beards fashionable for emperors.309310311312 After Rome During the Middle Ages some theologians such as Thomas Aquinas discussed Trajan as an example of a virtuous pagan. In the Divine Comedy Dante following this legend sees the spirit of Trajan in the Heaven of Jupiter with other historical and mythological persons noted for their justice. Also a mural of Trajan stopping to provide justice for a poor widow is present in the first terrace of Purgatory as a lesson to those who are purged for being proud.313 I noticed that the inner bank of the curve... Was of white marble and so decorated With carvings that not only Polycletus But nature herself would there be put to shame... There was recorded the high glory Of that ruler of Rome whose worth Moved Gregory to his great victory I mean by this the Emperor Trajan And at his bridle a poor widow Whose attitude bespoke tears and grief...

18 th century King Charles III of Spain commissioned Anton Raphael Mengs to paint The Triumph of Trajan on the ceiling of the banquet hall of the Royal Palace of Madrid  considered among the best works of this artist.315 It was only during the Enlightenment that this legacy began to be contested when Edward Gibbon expressed doubts about the militarized character of Trajans reign in contrast to the moderate practices of his immediate successors.316 Mommsen adopted a divided stance towards Trajan at some point of his posthumously published lectures even speaking about his vainglory Scheinglorie.317 Mommsen also speaks of Trajans insatiable unlimited lust for conquest.318 Although Mommsen had no liking for Trajans successor Hadrian  a repellent manner and a venomous envious and malicious nature  he admitted that Hadrian in renouncing Trajans conquests was doing what the situation clearly required.319 It was exactly this military character of Trajans reign that attracted his early twentiethcentury biographer the Italian historian Roberto Paribeni who in his 1927 twovolume biography Optimus Princeps described Trajans reign as the acme of the Roman principate which he saw as Italys patrimony.320 Following in Paribenis footsteps the German historian Alfred Heuss saw in Trajan the accomplished human embodiment of the imperial title die ideale Verkrperung des humanen Kaiserbegriffs.321 Trajans first Englishlanguage biography by Julian Bennett is also a positive one in that it assumes that Trajan was an active policymaker concerned with the management of the empire as a whole  something his reviewer Lendon considers an anachronistic outlook that sees in the Roman emperor a kind of modern administrator.322 During the 19
80 s the Romanian historian Eugen Cizek took a more nuanced view as he described the changes in the personal ideology of Trajans reign stressing the fact that it became ever more autocratic and militarized especially after 112 and towards the Parthian War as only an universal monarch a kosmocrator could dictate his law to the East.323 The biography by the German historian Karl Strobel stresses the continuity between Domitians and Trajans reigns saying that Trajans rule followed the same autocratic and sacred character as Domitians culminating in a failed Parthian adventure intended as the crown of his personal achievement.324 It is in modern French historiography that Trajans reputation becomes most markedly deflated Paul Petit writes about Trajans portraits as a lowbrow boor with a taste for booze and boys.325 For Paul Veyne what is to be retained from Trajans stylish qualities was that he was the last Roman emperor to think of the empire as a purely Italian and Romecentred hegemony of conquest. In contrast his successor Hadrian would stress the notion of the empire as ecumenical and of the emperor as universal benefactor and not kosmocrator.326 In Romanian culture In Romania Trajan Romanian Traian is regarded as one of the founders of the Romanian nation and a historical figure of great importance to the Romanian people and culture. This is due to his orchestration of the Dacian Wars that led to the foundation of the DacoRoman culture and the Latinbased Romanian language.327328 The creation of Roman Dacia is therefore seen in the country as the ethnogenesis of the Romanian nation. In Jewish legend In the Jewish homiletical works such as Esther Rabbah Trajan is described with the epitaph may his bones be crushed Hebrew   romanized shhik atzamot.329330 The same epitaph is also used for Hadrian.331 NervaAntonine family tree v t e NervaAntonine family tree Q.

Cassius Dio himself of provincial origin had little respect for the phylogeny of the emperor Trajan observing with barely disguised contempt that he was an Iberian and neither an Italian nor even an Italiote. In fact one ancient account derives Trajans paternal family the gens Ulpia from Tuder on the northern border of ancient Umbria an area where the clan is independently recorded... Traius like Ulpius while not especially common occurs with some frequency in northern Italy notably at Tuder and at the nearby municipality of Ameria the probable origo of Trajans mother strengthening the possibility of close family ties with the region... an Italian pedigree for the gens Ulpia seems certain... his family had settled at Italica Santiponce in southern Spain a few miles east of modern Seville. ... strictly speaking Trajan was an Hispaniensis an Italian domiciled or born in Spain as opposed to an Hispanus....

Battle of Sarmizegetusa Sarmizegetuza A.D. 105. During Trajans reign one of the most important Roman successes was the victory over the Dacians. The first important confrontation between the Romans and the Dacians had taken place in the year 87 and was initiated by Domitian. The praetorian prefect Cornelius Fuscus led five or six legions across the Danube on a bridge of ships and advanced towards Banat in Romania. The Romans were surprised by a Dacian attack at Tapae near the village of Bucova in Romania. Legion V Alaude was crushed and Cornelius Fuscus was killed. The victorious Dacian general was called Decebalus the brave one.  Schmitz 2005 p. 9.  Marcel Emerit. Les derniers travaux des historiens roumains sur la Dacie. In Revue des tudes Anciennes.

The first war began on 25 March 101 and the Roman troops consisting of four principal legions X Gemina XI Claudia II Traiana Fortis and XXX Ulpia Victrix defeated the Dacians.  a b Le Roux 1998 p. 73.

Although the Dacians had been defeated the emperor postponed the final siege for the conquering of Sarmizegetuza because his armies needed reorganization. Trajan imposed on the Dacians very hard peace conditions Decebalus had to renounce claim to part of his kingdom including the Banat Tara Hategului Oltenia and Muntenia in the area southwest of Transylvania. He had also to surrender all the Roman deserters and all his war machines. At Rome Trajan was received as a winner and he took the name of Dacicus a title that appears on his coinage of this period. At the beginning of the year 103 A.D. there were minted coins with the inscription IMP NERVA TRAIANVS AVG GER DACICVS.  Jackson Nicholas 2022. First Dacian War. Trajan Romes Last Conqueror

However during the years 103105 Decebalus did not respect the peace conditions imposed by Trajan and the emperor then decided to destroy completely the Dacian kingdom and to conquer Sarmizegetuza.  In the absence of literary references however the positioning of the new legions is conjectural some scholars think that Legio II Traiana Fortis was originally stationed on the Lower Danube and participated in the Second Dacian War being only later deployed to the Eastcf.
