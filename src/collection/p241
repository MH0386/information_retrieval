Basalt Igneous rock Composition Primary Mafic plagioclase amphibole and pyroxene Secondary Sometimes feldspathoids or olivine Basalt  UK bslt lt1 US bslt beslt2 is an aphanitic finegrained extrusive igneous rock formed from the rapid cooling of lowviscosity lava rich in magnesium and iron mafic lava exposed at or very near the surface of a rocky planet or moon. More than 90 of all volcanic rock on Earth is basalt. Rapidcooling finegrained basalt is chemically equivalent to slowcooling coarsegrained gabbro. The eruption of basalt lava is observed by geologists at about 20 volcanoes per year. Basalt is also an important rock type on other planetary bodies in the Solar System. For example the bulk of the plains of Venus which cover 80 of the surface are basaltic the lunar maria are plains of floodbasaltic lava flows and basalt is a common rock on the surface of Mars. Molten basalt lava has a low viscosity due to its relatively low silica content between 45 and 52 resulting in rapidly moving lava flows that can spread over great areas before cooling and solidifying. Flood basalts are thick sequences of many such flows that can cover hundreds of thousands of square kilometres and constitute the most voluminous of all volcanic formations. Basaltic magmas within Earth are thought to originate from the upper mantle. The chemistry of basalts thus provides clues to processes deep in Earths interior. Definition and characteristics QAPF diagram with basaltandesite field highlighted in yellow. Basalt is distinguished from andesite by SiO2  52. Basalt is field B in the TAS classification. Vesicular basalt at Sunset Crater Arizona. US quarter 
24 mm for scale. Columnar basalt flows in Yellowstone National Park USA Basalt is composed mostly of oxides of silicon iron magnesium potassium aluminum titanium and calcium. Geologists classify igneous rock by its mineral content whenever possible with the relative volume percentages of quartz crystalline silica SiO2 alkali feldspar plagioclase and feldspathoid QAPF being particularly important. An aphanitic finegrained igneous rock is classified as basalt when its QAPF fraction is composed of less than 10 feldspathoid and less than 20 quartz with plagioclase making up at least 65 of its feldspar content. This places basalt in the basaltandesite field of the QAPF diagram. Basalt is further distinguished from andesite by its silica content of under 
52.3 456 It is often not practical to determine the mineral composition of volcanic rocks due to their very fine grain size and geologists then classify the rocks chemically with the total content of alkali metal oxides and silica TAS being particularly important. Basalt is then defined as volcanic rock with a content of 45 to 52 silica and not more than 5 alkali metal oxides. This places basalt in the B field of the TAS diagram.346 Such a composition is described as mafic.7 Basalt is usually dark grey to black in colour due to its high content of augite or other darkcoloured pyroxene minerals8910 but can exhibit a wide range of shading. Some basalts are quite lightcoloured due to a high content of plagioclase and these are sometimes described as leucobasalts.1112 Lighter basalt can be difficult to distinguish from andesite but a common rule of thumb used in field research is that basalt has a color index of 35 or greater.13 The physical properties of basalt reflect its relatively low silica content and typically high iron and magnesium content.14 The average density of basalt is 
2.9  gcm3 compared with a typical density for granite of 
2.7  gcm
3.1 5 The viscosity of basaltic magma is relatively low around 104 to 105 cP although this is still many orders of magnitude higher than water which has a viscosity of about 1 cP. The viscosity of basaltic magma is similar to that of ketchup.16 Basalt is often porphyritic containing larger crystals phenocrysts formed prior to the extrusion that brought the magma to the surface embedded in a finergrained matrix. These phenocrysts usually are of augite olivine or a calciumrich plagioclase9 which have the highest melting temperatures of the typical minerals that can crystallize from the melt and are therefore the first to form solid crystals.1718 Basalt often contains vesicles formed when dissolved gases bubble out of the magma as it decompresses during its approach to the surface and the erupted lava then solidifies before the gases can escape. When vesicles make up a substantial fraction of the volume of the rock the rock is described as scoria.1920 The term basalt is at times applied to shallow intrusive rocks with a composition typical of basalt but rocks of this composition with a phaneritic coarser groundmass are more properly referred to as diabase also called dolerite or when more coarsegrained crystals over 2 mm across as gabbro. Diabase and gabbro are thus the hypabyssal and plutonic equivalents of basalt.421 Columnar basalt at Szent Gyrgy Hill Hungary In the Hadean Archean and early Proterozoic eons of Earths history the chemistry of erupted magmas was significantly different from todays due to immature crustal and asthenosphere differentiation. These ultramafic volcanic rocks with silica SiO2 contents below 45 are usually classified as komatiites.2223 Etymology The word basalt is ultimately derived from Late Latin basaltes a misspelling of Latin basanites very hard stone which was imported from Ancient Greek  basanites from  basanos touchstone.24 The modern petrological term basalt describing a particular composition of lavaderived rock originates from its use by Georgius Agricola in 1546 in his work De Natura Fossilium. Agricola applied basalt to the volcanic black rock beneath the Bishop of Meissens Stolpen castle believing it to be the same as the basaniten described by Pliny the Elder in AD 77 in Naturalis Historiae.25 Types Large masses must cool slowly to form a polygonal joint pattern as here at the Giants Causeway in Northern Ireland Columns of basalt near Bazaltove Ukraine On Earth most basalt forms by decompression melting of the mantle.26 The high pressure in the upper mantle due to the weight of the overlying rock raises the melting point of mantle rock so that almost all of the upper mantle is solid. However mantle rock is ductile the solid rock slowly deforms under high stress. When tectonic forces cause hot mantle rock to creep upwards the decrease of the pressure on the ascending rock can cause its melting point to drop enough for the rock to partially melt. This produces basaltic magma.27 Decompression melting can occur in a variety of tectonic settings. These include continental rift zones at midocean ridges above hotspots2829 and in backarc basins.30 Basalt is also produced in subduction zones where mantle rock rises into a mantle wedge above the descending slab. Decompression melting in this setting is enhanced by further lowering of the melting point by water vapor and other volatiles released from the slab.31 Each such setting produces basalt with distinctive characteristics.32 Tholeiitic basalt is relatively rich in iron and poor in alkali metals and aluminium.33 Included in this category are most basalts of the ocean floor most large oceanic islands34 and continental flood basalts such as the Columbia River Plateau.35 High and low titanium basalt. Basalt rocks are in some cases classified after their titanium Ti content in HighTi and LowTi varieties. HighTi and LowTi basalt has been distinguished in the Paran and Etendeka traps36 and the Emeishan Traps.37 Midocean ridge basalt MORB is a tholeiitic basalt commonly erupted only at ocean ridges and is characteristically low in incompatible elements.388 Although all MORBs are chemically similar geologists recognize that they vary significantly in how depleted they are in incompatible elements. Their presence in close proximity along midocean ridges is interpreted as evidence for mantle inhomogeneity.39 EMORB enriched MORB is relatively undepleted in incompatible elements. EMORB was once thought to be typical of hot spots along midocean ridges such as Iceland but is now known to be present in many locations along midocean ridges.40 NMORB normal MORB is average in its content of incompatible elements. DMORB depleted MORB is highly depleted in incompatible elements. Alkali basalt is relatively rich in alkali metals. It is silicaundersaturated and may contain feldspathoids33 alkali feldspar phlogopite and kaersutite. Augite in alkali basalts is titaniumenriched augite and lowcalcium pyroxenes are never present.41 They are characteristic of continental rifting and hotspot volcanism.42 Highalumina basalt has greater than 17 alumina Al
2 O3 and is intermediate in composition between tholeiitic basalt and alkali basalt. Its relatively aluminarich composition is based on rocks without phenocrysts of plagioclase. These represent the low silica end of the calcalkaline magma series and are characteristic of volcanic arcs above subduction zones.43 Boninite is a highmagnesium form of basalt that is erupted generally in backarc basins distinguished by its low titanium content and traceelement composition.44 Ocean island basalts include both tholeiites and alkali basalts with tholeiite predominating early in the eruptive history of the island. These basalts are characterized by elevated concentrations of incompatible elements. This suggests that their source mantle rock has produced little magma in the past it is undepleted.45 Petrology Photomicrograph of a thin section of basalt from Bazaltove Ukraine The mineralogy of basalt is characterized by a preponderance of calcic plagioclase feldspar and pyroxene. Olivine can also be a significant constituent.46 Accessory minerals present in relatively minor amounts include iron oxides and irontitanium oxides such as magnetite ulvspinel and ilmenite.41 Because of the presence of such oxide minerals basalt can acquire strong magnetic signatures as it cools and paleomagnetic studies have made extensive use of basalt.47 In tholeiitic basalt pyroxene augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite and calciumrich plagioclase are common phenocryst minerals. Olivine may also be a phenocryst and when present may have rims of pigeonite. The groundmass contains interstitial quartz or tridymite or cristobalite. Olivine tholeiitic basalt has augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite with abundant olivine but olivine may have rims of pyroxene and is unlikely to be present in the groundmass.41 Alkali basalts typically have mineral assemblages that lack orthopyroxene but contain olivine. Feldspar phenocrysts typically are labradorite to andesine in composition. Augite is rich in titanium compared to augite in tholeiitic basalt. Minerals such as alkali feldspar leucite nepheline sodalite phlogopite mica and apatite may be present in the groundmass.41 Basalt has high liquidus and solidus temperaturesvalues at the Earths surface are near or above 1200 C liquidus48 and near or below 1000 C solidus these values are higher than those of other common igneous rocks.49 The majority of tholeiitic basalts are formed at approximately 50100 km depth within the mantle. Many alkali basalts may be formed at greater depths perhaps as deep as 150200 km.5051 The origin of highalumina basalt continues to be controversial with disagreement over whether it is a primary melt or derived from other basalt types by fractionation.5265 Geochemistry Relative to most common igneous rocks basalt compositions are rich in MgO and CaO and low in SiO2 and the alkali oxides i.e. Na
2 O  K
2 O consistent with their TAS classification. Basalt contains more silica than picrobasalt and most basanites and tephrites but less than basaltic andesite. Basalt has a lower total content of alkali oxides than trachybasalt and most basanites and tephrites.6 Basalt generally has a composition of 4552 wt SiO2 25 wt total alkalis6 
0.5 
2.0  wt TiO2 514 wt FeO and 14 wt or more Al
2 O3. Contents of CaO are commonly near 10 wt those of MgO commonly in the range 5 to 12 wt.53 Highalumina basalts have aluminium contents of 1719 wt Al
2 O3 boninites have magnesium MgO contents of up to 15 percent. Rare feldspathoidrich mafic rocks akin to alkali basalts may have Na
2 O  K
2 O contents of 12 or more.54 The abundances of the lanthanide or rareearth elements REE can be a useful diagnostic tool to help explain the history of mineral crystallisation as the melt cooled. In particular the relative abundance of europium compared to the other REE is often markedly higher or lower and called the europium anomaly. It arises because Eu2 can substitute for Ca2 in plagioclase feldspar unlike any of the other lanthanides which tend to only form 3 cations.55 Midocean ridge basalts MORB and their intrusive equivalents gabbros are the characteristic igneous rocks formed at midocean ridges. They are tholeiitic basalts particularly low in total alkalis and in incompatible trace elements and they have relatively flat REE patterns normalized to mantle or chondrite values. In contrast alkali basalts have normalized patterns highly enriched in the light REE and with greater abundances of the REE and of other incompatible elements. Because MORB basalt is considered a key to understanding plate tectonics its compositions have been much studied. Although MORB compositions are distinctive relative to average compositions of basalts erupted in other environments they are not uniform. For instance compositions change with position along the MidAtlantic Ridge and the compositions also define different ranges in different ocean basins.56 Midocean ridge basalts have been subdivided into varieties such as normal NMORB and those slightly more enriched in incompatible elements EMORB.57 Isotope ratios of elements such as strontium neodymium lead hafnium and osmium in basalts have been much studied to learn about the evolution of the Earths mantle.58 Isotopic ratios of noble gases such as 
3 He
4 He are also of great value for instance ratios for basalts range from 6 to 10 for midocean ridge tholeiitic basalt normalized to atmospheric values but to 1524 and more for oceanisland basalts thought to be derived from mantle plumes.59 Source rocks for the partial melts that produce basaltic magma probably include both peridotite and pyroxenite.60 Morphology and textures An active basalt lava flow The shape structure and texture of a basalt is diagnostic of how and where it eruptedfor example whether into the sea in an explosive cinder eruption or as creeping phoehoe lava flows the classic image of Hawaiian basalt eruptions.61 Subaerial eruptions Main article Subaerial eruption Basalt that erupts under open air that is subaerially forms three distinct types of lava or volcanic deposits scoria ash or cinder breccia62 and lava flows.63 Basalt in the tops of subaerial lava flows and cinder cones will often be highly vesiculated imparting a lightweight frothy texture to the rock.64 Basaltic cinders are often red coloured by oxidized iron from weathered ironrich minerals such as pyroxene.65 A types of blocky cinder and breccia flows of thick viscous basaltic lava are common in Hawaii. Phoehoe is a highly fluid hot form of basalt which tends to form thin aprons of molten lava which fill up hollows and sometimes forms lava lakes. Lava tubes are common features of phoehoe eruptions.63 Basaltic tuff or pyroclastic rocks are less common than basaltic lava flows. Usually basalt is too hot and fluid to build up sufficient pressure to form explosive lava eruptions but occasionally this will happen by trapping of the lava within the volcanic throat and buildup of volcanic gases. Hawaiis Mauna Loa volcano erupted in this way in the 
19 th century as did Mount Tarawera New Zealand in its violent 1886 eruption. Maar volcanoes are typical of small basalt tuffs formed by explosive eruption of basalt through the crust forming an apron of mixed basalt and wall rock breccia and a fan of basalt tuff further out from the volcano.66 Amygdaloidal structure is common in relict vesicles and beautifully crystallized species of zeolites quartz or calcite are frequently found.67 Columnar basalt Main article Columnar jointing See also List of places with columnar basalt The Giants Causeway in Northern Ireland Columnar jointed basalt in Turkey Columnar basalt at Cape Stolbchaty Russia During the cooling of a thick lava flow contractional joints or fractures form.68 If a flow cools relatively rapidly significant contraction forces build up. While a flow can shrink in the vertical dimension without fracturing it cannot easily accommodate shrinking in the horizontal direction unless cracks form the extensive fracture network that develops results in the formation of columns. These structures are predominantly hexagonal in crosssection but polygons with three to twelve or more sides can be observed.69 The size of the columns depends loosely on the rate of cooling very rapid cooling may result in very small 1 cm diameter columns while slow cooling is more likely to produce large columns.70 Submarine eruptions Main article Submarine eruption Pillow basalts on the Pacific seafloor The character of submarine basalt eruptions is largely determined by depth of water since increased pressure restricts the release of volatile gases and results in effusive eruptions.71 It has been estimated that at depths greater than 500 metres 1600 ft explosive activity associated with basaltic magma is suppressed.72 Above this depth submarine eruptions are often explosive tending to produce pyroclastic rock rather than basalt flows.73 These eruptions described as Surtseyan are characterised by large quantities of steam and gas and the creation of large amounts of pumice.74 Pillow basalts Main article Pillow lava When basalt erupts underwater or flows into the sea contact with the water quenches the surface and the lava forms a distinctive pillow shape through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow. This pillow texture is very common in underwater basaltic flows and is diagnostic of an underwater eruption environment when found in ancient rocks. Pillows typically consist of a finegrained core with a glassy crust and have radial jointing. The size of individual pillows varies from 10 cm up to several metres.75 When phoehoe lava enters the sea it usually forms pillow basalts. However when a enters the ocean it forms a littoral cone a small coneshaped accumulation of tuffaceous debris formed when the blocky a lava enters the water and explodes from builtup steam.76 The island of Surtsey in the Atlantic Ocean is a basalt volcano which breached the ocean surface in 1963. The initial phase of Surtseys eruption was highly explosive as the magma was quite fluid causing the rock to be blown apart by the boiling steam to form a tuff and cinder cone. This has subsequently moved to a typical phoehoetype behaviour.7778 Volcanic glass may be present particularly as rinds on rapidly chilled surfaces of lava flows and is commonly but not exclusively associated with underwater eruptions.79 Pillow basalt is also produced by some subglacial volcanic eruptions.79 Distribution Earth Basalt is the most common volcanic rock type on Earth making up over 90 of all volcanic rock on the planet.80 The crustal portions of oceanic tectonic plates are composed predominantly of basalt produced from upwelling mantle below the ocean ridges.81 Basalt is also the principal volcanic rock in many oceanic islands including the islands of Hawaii34 the Faroe Islands82 and Runion.83 The eruption of basalt lava is observed by geologists at about 20 volcanoes per year.84 Paran Traps Brazil Basalt is the rock most typical of large igneous provinces. These include continental flood basalts the most voluminous basalts found on land.35 Examples of continental flood basalts included the Deccan Traps in India85 the Chilcotin Group in British Columbia86 Canada the Paran Traps in Brazil87 the Siberian Traps in Russia88 the Karoo flood basalt province in South Africa89 and the Columbia River Plateau of Washington and Oregon.90 Basalt is also prevalent across extensive regions of the Eastern Galilee Golan and Bashan in Israel and Syria.91 Basalt also is common around volcanic arcs specially those on thin crust.92 Ancient Precambrian basalts are usually only found in fold and thrust belts and are often heavily metamorphosed. These are known as greenstone belts9394 because lowgrade metamorphism of basalt produces chlorite actinolite epidote and other green minerals.95 Other bodies in the Solar System As well as forming large parts of the Earths crust basalt also occurs in other parts of the Solar System. Basalt commonly erupts on Io the third largest moon of Jupiter96 and has also formed on the Moon Mars Venus and the asteroid Vesta. The Moon Lunar olivine basalt collected by Apollo 15 astronauts The dark areas visible on Earths moon the lunar maria are plains of flood basaltic lava flows. These rocks were sampled both by the crewed American Apollo program and the robotic Russian Luna program and are represented among the lunar meteorites.97 Lunar basalts differ from their Earth counterparts principally in their high iron contents which typically range from about 17 to 22 wt FeO. They also possess a wide range of titanium concentrations present in the mineral ilmenite9899 ranging from less than 1 wt TiO2 to about 13 wt.. Traditionally lunar basalts have been classified according to their titanium content with classes being named highTi lowTi and verylowTi. Nevertheless global geochemical maps of titanium obtained from the Clementine mission demonstrate that the lunar maria possess a continuum of titanium concentrations and that the highest concentrations are the least abundant.100 Lunar basalts show exotic textures and mineralogy particularly shock metamorphism lack of the oxidation typical of terrestrial basalts and a complete lack of hydration.101 Most of the Moons basalts erupted between about 3 and 
3.5  billion years ago but the oldest samples are 
4.2  billion years old and the youngest flows based on the age dating method of crater counting are estimated to have erupted only 
1.2  billion years ago.102 Venus From 1972 to 1985 five Venera and two VEGA landers successfully reached the surface of Venus and carried out geochemical measurements using Xray fluorescence and gammaray analysis. These returned results consistent with the rock at the landing sites being basalts including both tholeiitic and highly alkaline basalts. The landers are thought to have landed on plains whose radar signature is that of basaltic lava flows. These constitute about 80 of the surface of Venus. Some locations show high reflectivity consistent with unweathered basalt indicating basaltic volcanism within the last 
2.5  million years.103 Mars Basalt is also a common rock on the surface of Mars as determined by data sent back from the planets surface104 and by Martian meteorites.105106 Vesta Analysis of Hubble Space Telescope images of Vesta suggests this asteroid has a basaltic crust covered with a brecciated regolith derived from the crust.107 Evidence from Earthbased telescopes and the Dawn mission suggest that Vesta is the source of the HED meteorites which have basaltic characteristics.108 Vesta is the main contributor to the inventory of basaltic asteroids of the main Asteroid Belt.109 Io Lava flows represent a major volcanic terrain on Io.110 Analysis of the Voyager images led scientists to believe that these flows were composed mostly of various compounds of molten sulfur. However subsequent Earthbased infrared studies and measurements from the Galileo spacecraft indicate that these flows are composed of basaltic lava with mafic to ultramafic compositions.111 This conclusion is based on temperature measurements of Ios hotspots or thermalemission locations which suggest temperatures of at least 1300 K and some as high as 1600 K.112 Initial estimates suggesting eruption temperatures approaching 2000 K113 have since proven to be overestimates because the wrong thermal models were used to model the temperatures.112114 Alteration of basalt Weathering See also Weathering Kaolinized basalt near Hungen Vogelsberg Germany Compared to granitic rocks exposed at the Earths surface basalt outcrops weather relatively rapidly. This reflects their content of minerals that crystallized at higher temperatures and in an environment poorer in water vapor than granite. These minerals are less stable in the colder wetter environment at the Earths surface. The finer grain size of basalt and the volcanic glass sometimes found between the grains also hasten weathering. The high iron content of basalt causes weathered surfaces in humid climates to accumulate a thick crust of hematite or other iron oxides and hydroxides staining the rock a brown to rustred colour.115116117118 Because of the low potassium content of most basalts weathering converts the basalt to calciumrich clay montmorillonite rather than potassiumrich clay illite. Further weathering particularly in tropical climates converts the montmorillonite to kaolinite or gibbsite. This produces the distinctive tropical soil known as laterite.115 The ultimate weathering product is bauxite the principal ore of aluminium.119 Chemical weathering also releases readily watersoluble cations such as calcium sodium and magnesium which give basaltic areas a strong buffer capacity against acidification.120 Calcium released by basalts binds CO2 from the atmosphere forming CaCO3 acting thus as a CO2 trap.121 Metamorphism Metamorphosed basalt from an Archean greenstone belt in Michigan US. The minerals that gave the original basalt its black colour have been metamorphosed into green minerals. Intense heat or great pressure transforms basalt into its metamorphic rock equivalents. Depending on the temperature and pressure of metamorphism these may include greenschist amphibolite or eclogite. Basalts are important rocks within metamorphic regions because they can provide vital information on the conditions of metamorphism that have affected the region.122 Metamorphosed basalts are important hosts for a variety of hydrothermal ores including deposits of gold copper and volcanogenic massive sulfides.123 Life on basaltic rocks The common corrosion features of underwater volcanic basalt suggest that microbial activity may play a significant role in the chemical exchange between basaltic rocks and seawater. The significant amounts of reduced iron FeII and manganese MnII present in basaltic rocks provide potential energy sources for bacteria. Some FeIIoxidizing bacteria cultured from ironsulfide surfaces are also able to grow with basaltic rock as a source of FeII.124 Fe and Mn oxidizing bacteria have been cultured from weathered submarine basalts of Kamaehuakanaloa Seamount formerly Loihi.125 The impact of bacteria on altering the chemical composition of basaltic glass and thus the oceanic crust and seawater suggest that these interactions may lead to an application of hydrothermal vents to the origin of life.126 Uses The Code of Hammurabi was engraved on a 
2.2 5 m 7 ft 412 in tall basalt stele in around 1750 BC. Basalt is used in construction e.g. as building blocks or in the groundwork127 making cobblestones from columnar basalt128 and in making statues.129130 Heating and extruding basalt yields stone wool which has potential to be an excellent thermal insulator.131132133134 Carbon sequestration in basalt has been studied as a means of removing carbon dioxide produced by human industrialization from the atmosphere. Underwater basalt deposits scattered in seas around the globe have the added benefit of the water serving as a barrier to the rerelease of CO2 into the atmosphere.135136 See also Basalt fan structure  Rock formation Basalt fiber  Structural fibres spun from melted basalt Bimodal volcanism  Eruption of both mafic and felsic lavas from a single volcanic centre Plutonism  Geological theory that Earths igneous rocks formed by solidification of molten material Polybaric melting  A mode of origin of basaltic magma Shield volcano  Lowprofile volcano usually formed almost entirely of fluid lava flows Spilite  Finegrained igneous rock resulting from alteration of oceanic basalt Sideromelane  Vitreous basaltic volcanic glass Volcano  Rupture in a planets crust where material escapes Geology portal References  basalt.
