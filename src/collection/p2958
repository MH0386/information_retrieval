28 th Dynasty or Dynasty 28 is usually classified as the third dynasty of the Ancient Egyptian Late Period. The 
28 th Dynasty lasted from 404 BC to 398 BC and it includes only one Pharaoh Amyrtaeus Amenirdis also known as Psamtik V or Psammetichus V. Amyrtaeus was probably the grandson of the Amyrtaeus of Sais who carried on a rebellion in 465463 BC with the Egyptian chief Inarus himself a grandson of Psamtik III against the satrap Achaemenes of Achaemenid Egypt. Historyedit As early as 411 BC Amyrtaeus a native Egyptian revolted against Darius II the Achaemenid Persian King and the last Pharaoh of the 
27 th Dynasty. Amyrtaeus succeeded in expelling the Persians from Memphis in 405 BC with assistance from Cretan mercenaries and in 404 BC following the death of Darius proclaimed himself Pharaoh of Egypt. Although Artaxerxes II Darius successor as King of Persia attempted to lead an expedition to retake Egypt he was unable to do so due to political problems with his brother Cyrus the Younger. This allowed Amyrtaeus to solidify Egyptian rule over Egypt. Very little is known about Amyrtaeus reign. No monuments from this dynasty have been found. In 398 BC Amyrtaeus was overthrown and executed by Nefaarud I ending the 
28 th Dynasty and beginning the
