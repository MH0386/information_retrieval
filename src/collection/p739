11 th Dynasties under the group title First Intermediate Period.1 The dynasty that seems to have supplanted the Eighth Dynasty is extremely obscure. The takeover by the rulers of Herakleopolis was violent and is reflected in Manethos description of Achthoes the founder of the dynasty as more terrible than his predecessors who wrought evil things for those in all Egypt. Rulersedit The Ninth Dynasty was founded at Herakleopolis Magna and the Tenth Dynasty continued there. At this time Egypt was not unified and there is some overlap between these and other local dynasties. The Turin Canon lists eighteen kings for this royal line but their names are damaged unidentifiable or lost.2 The following is a possible list of rulers of the Ninth Dynasty based on the Turin Canon as egyptologists have differing opinions about the order of succession within the two dynasties. Among them only Meryibre Khety and Nebkaure Khety are undoubtedly attested by archaeological finds Dynasty IX according to Hayes c. 2160  2130 BC3 Name Image Comments Meryibre Khety I Manethos Achthoes a nomarch who proclaimed himself pharaoh name lost  Neferkare VII Might be the Kaneferre mentioned in the tomb of the nomarch Ankhtifi Nebkaure Khety II Also mentioned in The Eloquent Peasant tale Setut  name lost  Mery...
