Born of Thracian origin  giving the nickname Thrax the Thracian  he rose up through the military ranks ultimately holding high command in the army of the Rhine under Emperor Severus Alexander. After Severus was murdered in 235 he was proclaimed emperor by the army beginning the Crisis of the Third Century. His father was an accountant in the governors office. Maximinus was the commander of the Legio IV Italica when Severus Alexander was assassinated by his own troops in 235. The Pannonian army then elected Maximinus emperor.4 In 238 which came to be known as the Year of the Six Emperors a senatorial revolt broke out leading to the successive proclamation of Gordian I Gordian II Pupienus Balbinus and Gordian III as emperors in opposition to Maximinus. Maximinus advanced on Rome to put down the revolt but was halted at Aquileia where he was assassinated by disaffected elements of the Legio II Parthica. Maximinus is described by several ancient sources though only Herodians Roman History is contemporary. He was a socalled barracks emperor of the 
3 rd century5 his rule is often considered to mark the beginning of the Crisis of the Third Century. Maximinus was the first emperor who hailed neither from the senatorial class nor from the equestrian class. Backgroundedit The names Gaius Julius suggest that his family acquired Roman citizenship during the reign of the JulioClaudian dynasty as freedmen and newly integrated Romans always adopted the names of their former masters.6 His exact birth date is unknown but the Chronicon Paschale and the epitome of Joannes Zonaras both written centuries later record that he died at the age of 65 implying a birth in 1
73.7 8 Herodian writes that Maximinus was of ThracoRoman origin.9 According to the notoriously unreliable Historia Augusta he was born in Thrace or Moesia to a Gothic father and an Alanic mother10 however the supposed parentage is a highly unlikely anachronism as the Goths are known to have moved to Thrace from a different place of origin much later in history and their residence in the Danubian area is not otherwise attested until after Maximinus death. British historian Ronald Syme writing that the word Gothia should have sufficed for condemnation of the passage in the Historia Augusta felt that the burden of evidence from Herodian Syncellus and elsewhere pointed to Maximinus having been born in Moesia.11 The references to his Gothic ancestry might refer to a Thracian Getic origin the two populations were often confused by later writers most notably by Jordanes in his Getica as suggested by the paragraphs describing how he was singularly beloved by the Getae moreover as if he were one of themselves and how he spoke almost pure Thracian.12 On the contrary Bernard Bachrach suggests that the Historia Augusta use of a term not used in Maximinus time  Gothia  is hardly sufficient cause to dismiss its account. After all the names it gives for Maximinus parents are legitimate Alan and Gothic appellations. Hence Bachrach argues the most straightforward explanation is that the author of the Historia Augusta relied on a legitimate third century source but substituted its terminology for that concurrent in his own day.13 Accordingly Maximinus ancestry remains an open question. His background was in any case that of a provincial of low birth and he was seen by the Senate as a barbarian not even a true Roman despite Caracallas edict granting citizenship to all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire.14 According to the Augustan History he was a shepherd and bandit leader before joining the Imperial Roman army causing historian Brent Shaw to comment that a man who would have been in other circumstances a Godfather ... became emperor of Rome.15 In many ways Maximinus was similar to the later ThracoRoman emperors of the 
3 rd
5 th century Licinius Galerius Aureolus Leo I etc. elevating themselves via a military career from the condition of a common soldier in one of the Roman legions to the foremost positions of political power. He joined the army during the reign of Septimius Severus.16 Maximinus was in command of Legio IV Italica composed of recruits from Pannonia17 who were angered by Alexanders payments to the Alemanni and his avoidance of war.18 The troops who included the Legio XXII Primigenia elected Maximinus killing Alexander and his mother at Moguntiacum modern Mainz.19 The Praetorian Guard acclaimed him emperor and their choice was grudgingly confirmed by the Senate14 who were displeased to have a peasant as emperor. His son Maximus became caesar.14 Ruleedit Consolidation of poweredit O laureate draped and cuirassed bust of Maximinus MAXIMINVS PIVS AVG GERM R Maximinus holding sceptre standard on either side P M TR P II COS P P Silver denarius struck in Rome from February to December 236 AD ref. RIC 4 Maximinus began his rule by eliminating the close advisors of Alexander.20 His suspicions may have been justified two plots against Maximinus were foiled.21 The first was during a campaign across the Rhine when a group of officers supported by influential senators plotted to destroy a bridge across the river in order to strand Maximinus in hostile territory.22 They planned to elect senator Magnus emperor afterwards but the conspiracy was discovered and the conspirators executed. The second plot involved Mesopotamian archers who were loyal to Alexander. They planned to elevate Quartinus but their leader Macedo changed sides and murdered Quartinus instead although this was not enough to save his own life.23 Defense of frontiersedit The accession of Maximinus is commonly seen as the beginning of the Crisis of the Third Century also known as the Military Anarchy or the Imperial Crisis the commonly applied name for the crumbling and near collapse of the Roman Empire between 235 and 284 caused by various simultaneous crises. Maximinus first campaign was against the Alemanni whom he defeated despite heavy Roman casualties in a swamp in the Agri Decumates.24 After the victory Maximinus took the title Germanicus Maximus14 raised his son Maximus to the rank of caesar and princeps iuventutis and deified his late wife Paulina.20 Maximinus may have launched a second campaign deep into Germania defeating a Germanic tribe beyond the Weser in the Battle at the Harzhorn.2526 Securing the German frontier at least for a while Maximinus then set up a winter encampment at Sirmium in Pannonia14 and from that supply base fought the Dacians and the Sarmatians during the winter of 2352
36.2 0 Infrastructure workedit In 2019 Israeli researchers translated a milestone found in the Moshav Ramot village in the Golan Heights. They were able to identify the name of Maximinus on the milestone. The roads themselves were much older suggesting that a massive renovation project was undertaken during his rule on those roads.27 Gordian I and Gordian IIedit Part of a series on Roman imperial dynasties Year of the Six Emperors AD 238 Maximinus Thrax Gordian I and Gordian II Pupienus and Balbinus Gordian III v t e Early in 238 in the province of Africa a treasury officials extortions through false judgments in corrupt courts against some local landowners ignited a fullscale revolt in the province.citation needed The landowners armed their clients and their agricultural workers and entered Thysdrus modern El Djem where they murdered the offending official and his bodyguards28 and proclaimed the aged governor of the province Marcus Antonius Gordianus Sempronianus Gordian I and his son Gordian II as coemperors.29 The Senate in Rome switched allegiance gave both Gordian and Gordian II the title of Augustus and set about rousing the provinces in support of the pair.30 Maximinus wintering at Sirmium immediately assembled his army and advanced on Rome the Pannonian legions leading the way.20 Meanwhile in Africa the revolt had not gone as planned. The province of Africa was bordered on the west by the province of Numidia whose governor Capelianus nursed a longstanding grudge against the Gordians and controlled the only legionary unit III Augusta in the area.31 Gordian II was killed in the fighting and on hearing this Gordian I hanged himself with his belt.32 Pupienus Balbinus and Gordian IIIedit Ruins of Imperial Palace at Sirmium today in Sremska Mitrovica When the African revolt collapsed the Senate found itself in great jeopardy.33 Having shown clear support for the Gordians they could expect no clemency from Maximinus when he reached Rome. In this predicament they remained determined to defy Maximinus and elected two of their number Pupienus and Balbinus as coemperors.20 When the Roman mob heard that the Senate had selected two men from the patrician class men whom the ordinary people held in no great regard they protested showering the imperial cortge with sticks and stones.34 A faction in Rome preferred Gordians grandson Gordian III and there was severe street fighting. The coemperors had no option but to compromise and sending for the grandson of the elder Gordian they appointed him caesar.35 Defeat and deathedit Maximinus marched on Rome36 but Aquileia closed its gates against him. His troops became disaffected during the unexpected siege of the city at which time they suffered from starvation.37 In May or June 238 soldiers of the II Parthica in his camp assassinated him his son and his chief ministers.33 Their heads were cut off placed on poles and carried to Rome by cavalrymen.
20 a Pupienus and Balbinus then became undisputed coemperors. However they mistrusted each other and ultimately both were murdered by the Praetorian Guard making Gordian III sole surviving emperor. Unable to reach Rome Thrax never visited the capital city during his reign.38 Politicsedit Maximinus doubled the pay of soldiers16 this act along with virtually continuous warfare required higher taxes. Tax collectors began to resort to violent methods and illegal confiscations further alienating the governing class from everyone else.20 According to early church historian Eusebius of Caesarea the Imperial household of Maximinus predecessor Alexander had contained many Christians. Eusebius states that hating his predecessors household Maximinus ordered that the leaders of the churches should be put to death.3940 According to Eusebius this persecution of 235 sent Hippolytus of Rome and Pope Pontian into exile but other evidence suggests that the persecutions of 235 were local to the provinces where they occurred rather than happening under the direction of the Emperor.41 According to Historia Augusta which modern scholars however treat with extreme caution The Romans could bear his barbarities no longer  the way in which he called up informers and incited accusers invented false offences killed innocent men condemned all whoever came to trial reduced the richest men to utter poverty and never sought money anywhere save in some others ruin put many generals and many men of consular rank to death for no offence carried others about in waggons without food and drink and kept others in confinement in short neglected nothing which he thought might prove effectual for cruelty  and unable to suffer these things longer they rose against him in revolt.42 Appearanceedit Portrait in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek. 4344 Ancient sources ranging from the unreliable Historia Augusta to accounts of Herodian speak of Maximinus as a man of significantly greater size than his contemporaries.4546 He is moreover depicted in ancient imagery as a man with a prominent brow nose and jaw symptoms of acromegaly.47 His thumb was said to be so large that he wore his wifes bracelet as a ring for it. According to Historia Augusta he was of such size so Cordus reports that men said he was eightfeet one finger c. 
2.4  metres in height.48 It is very likely however that this is one of the many exaggerations in the Historia Augusta and is immediately suspect due to its citation of Cordus one of several fictitious authorities the work cites.49 Although not going into the supposedly detailed portions of Historia Augusta the historian Herodian a contemporary of Maximinus mentions him as a man of greater size noting that He was in any case a man of such frightening appearance and colossal size that there is no obvious comparison to be drawn with any of the besttrained Greek athletes or warrior elite of the barbarians.50 Some historians interpret the stories on Maximinuss unusual height as well as other information on his appearance like excessive sweating and superhuman strength as popular stereotyped attributes which do no more than intentionally turn him into a stylized embodiment of the barbarian bandit51 or emphasize the admiration and aversion that the image of the soldier evoked in the civilian population.52 See alsoedit Aspasius of Ravenna his secretary as emperor Notesedit  His death is sometimes dated to 24 June. This is based on the 3 years 4 months 2 days reignlength given by the mostly inaccurate Chronograph of 354. Papyri show that Pupienus and Balbinus were recognized in Thebes by 21 July 238 meaning that their proclamation probably took place the month before. Some historians interpreted the Chronographs figure as 3 years 3 months and 2 days. This gives 24 June reckoning from 22 March 235 the date of Alaxanders death although some time did pass between Maximinus proclamation and Alexanders death.1 Referencesedit Citationsedit  a b Rea J.
