12 th Dynasty 
19 th century BCE. The pyramid is the northernmost among those of Dahshur and stands around 
1.5  km northeast of Sneferus Red Pyramid. It was erected on leveled ground and composed of a mudbricks core covered with a casing of white Tura limestone blocks resting on foundations. It was first excavated in 1894 by the French Egyptologist Jacques de Morgan who managed to reach the burial chamber after discovering a tunnel dug by ancient tomb robbers.1 A more recent campaign was led by Dieter Arnold during the 19
90 s. Pyramid complexedit Map of the complex The original project included the main pyramid along with a northern chapel and a small eastern mortuary temple all surrounded by an enclosure wall. Outside this enclosure were seven tombs belonging to Senusrets queens and princesses and the whole complex was again surrounded by an outer wall this wall was enlarged during the works in order to accommodate a large temple on the southern side and a causeway.1 The remains of six sacred barques were excavated outside the outer enclosure on the southern side.2 The nowdemolished eastern temple was very small in size perhaps a sign of the decline of the traditional funerary cult as Arnold suggested. On the remaining reliefs were depicted conventional scenes of offerings to the enthroned Senusret III. The southern temple was likely demolished during the New Kingdom and according to its foundations it consisted in a colonnaded courtyard and an inner shrine. The valley temple has not been discovered.3 Many shaft tombs belonged to the royal women were discovered on the northern and southern sides of the main pyramid it was believed that these shafts were topped by mastabas until Arnold in 1997 demonstrated that these consisted in the intricated rockcut hypogea of seven small pyramids. Explorations of the northern tombs led to the discovery of the treasures of princesses Sithathor and Mereret among these objects the famous pectorals with the names of Senusret II Senusret III and Amenemhat III now exhibited at the Cairo Museum as well as the sarcophagi of princesses Menet and Senetsenebtysy and of queen Neferthenut.24 Among the southern tombs the easternmost was discovered in 1994 and its hypogeum led to a burial chamber located under the main pyramid. Here a granite sarcophagus was found along with some objects bearing the name of Khenemetneferhedjet I Weret Senusret IIIs royal mother.2 Hypogeumedit Graffito of the strikinghaired digger De Morgan struggled for months to find the original entrance after digging several tunnels directed towards the center of the monument he finally found the thieves tunnel. One of the passages was covered by graffiti which were rather alien to the Egyptian canons the most famous among these represents a human head with a striking hairstyle. De Morgan argued that the tunnels and the graffiti were made by Semitic grave robbers during the Hyksos occupation. From the thieves tunnels de Morgan was able to trace the original entrance.5 Hypogea of the main pyramid left and of the four northern small pyramids right From the entrance located on the western side of the pyramid a long descending hallway led to an antechamber which connects a storeroom on the west wall to the kings chamber on the east wall the latter made from granite and provided with a granite sarcophagus on the western side and a niche for the canopic chest on the southern one. The granite walls of the burial chamber were whiten with gypsum. Above the chamber Arnold found three relieving vaults made from granite the bottom one limestone the middle one and mudbricks the top one which were meant to discharge the weight on the underlying chambers walls in order to prevent a roof collapse. The kings chamber contained pottery and a dagger while the granite sarcophagus was empty. It is possible that Senusret III was never buried there and that he might have preferred his Abydene tomb as his final resting place as suggested by the lack of a blocking system within this hypogeum.1 See alsoedit List of Egyptian pyramids Referencesedit  a b c Lehner 1997 p. 177  a b c Lehner 1997 p. 179  Lehner 1997 p. 178  Grimal 1992 p. 178  Cimmino 1996 pp. 2889 n. 9 Cimmino Franco 1996.
