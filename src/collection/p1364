Together with the Tigris it is one of the two defining rivers of Mesopotamia lit.the land between the rivers. Originating in Turkey the Euphrates flows through Syria and Iraq to join the Tigris in the Shatt alArab in Iraq which empties into the Persian Gulf. The Euphrates is the fifteenthlongest river in Asia and the longest in Western Asia at about 2780 km 1730 mi with a drainage area of 440000 km2 170000 sq mi that covers six countries. Etymologyedit The term Euphrates derives from the Greek Euphrts  adapted from Old Persian  romanized hUfrtu2 itself from Elamite  romanized ipratui. The Elamite name is ultimately derived from cuneiform  read as Buranun in Sumerian and Purattu in Akkadian many cuneiform signs have a Sumerian pronunciation and an Akkadian pronunciation taken from a Sumerian word and an Akkadian word that mean the same. The Akkadian Purattu3 has been perpetuated in Semitic languages cf. Arabic  alFurt Syriac  Pr Hebrew  Pr and in other nearby languages of the time cf. Hurrian Puranti Sabarian Uruttu. The Elamite Akkadian and possibly Sumerian forms are suggested to be from an unrecorded substrate language.4 Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze and Vyacheslav Ivanov suggest the protoSumerian burudu copper Sumerian urudu as an origin with an explanation that Euphrates was the river by which copper ore was transported in rafts since Mesopotamia was the center of copper metallurgy during the period.5 The Euphrates is called Yeprat in Armenian  Perat in modern Hebrew  Frat in Turkish and Firat in Kurdish. The Mandaic name is Pra  and is often mentioned as Pra Ziwa pronounced Fra Ziwa in Mandaean scriptures such as the Ginza Rabba.6 In Mandaean scriptures the Euphrates is considered to be the earthly manifestation of the heavenly yardna or flowing river similar to the Yazidi concept of Lalish being the earthly manifestation of its heavenly counterpart7 or the Sacred House Kaaba in Mecca being the earthly manifestation of the heavenly AlBayt AlMamur.8 The earliest references to the Euphrates come from cuneiform texts found in Shuruppak and preSargonic Nippur in southern Iraq and date to the mid
3 rd millennium BCE. In these texts written in Sumerian the Euphrates is called Buranuna logographic UD.KIB.NUN. The name could also be written KIB.NUN.NA or dKIB.NUN with the prefix d indicating that the river was a divinity. In Sumerian the name of the city of Sippar in modernday Iraq was also written UD.KIB.NUN indicating a historically strong relationship between the city and the river. Courseedit Plan topographic representation of Babylon. The clay tablet depicts Tuba a suburb of the ancient city of Babylon. The River Euphrates is represented by the waterlined band. 660500 BCE. British Museum The Euphrates is the longest river of Western Asia.9 It emerges from the confluence of the Kara Su or Western Euphrates 450 kilometres 280 mi and the Murat Su or Eastern Euphrates 650 kilometres 400 mi 10 kilometres 
6.2  mi upstream from the town of Keban in southeastern Turkey.10 Daoudy and Frenken put the length of the Euphrates from the source of the Murat River to the confluence with the Tigris at 3000 kilometres 1900 mi of which 1230 kilometres 760 mi is in Turkey 710 kilometres 440 mi in Syria and 1060 kilometres 660 mi in Iraq.1112 The same figures are given by Isaev and Mikhailova.13 The length of the Shatt alArab which connects the Euphrates and the Tigris with the Persian Gulf is given by various sources as 145195 kilometres 90121 mi.14 Both the Kara Su and the Murat Su rise northwest from Lake Van at elevations of 3290 metres 10790 ft and 3520 metres 11550 ft amsl respectively.15 At the location of the Keban Dam the two rivers now combined into the Euphrates have dropped to an elevation of 693 metres 2274 ft amsl. From Keban to the SyrianTurkish border the river drops another 368 metres 1207 ft over a distance of less than 600 kilometres 370 mi. Once the Euphrates enters the Upper Mesopotamian plains its grade drops significantly within Syria the river falls 163 metres 535 ft while over the last stretch between Ht and the Shatt alArab the river drops only 55 metres 180 ft.1016 Dischargeedit The Euphrates receives most of its water in the form of rainfall and melting snow resulting in peak volumes during the months April through May. Discharge in these two months accounts for 36 percent of the total annual discharge of the Euphrates or even 6070 percent according to one source while low runoff occurs in summer and autumn.1317 The average natural annual flow of the Euphrates has been determined from early and midtwentieth century records as 
20.9  cubic kilometres 
5.0  cu mi at Keban 
36.6  cubic kilometres 
8.8  cu mi at Ht and 
21.5  cubic kilometres 
5.2  cu mi at Hindiya.18 However these averages mask the high interannual variability in discharge at Birecik just north of the SyroTurkish border annual discharges have been measured that ranged from a low volume of

63.1 9 The discharge regime of the Euphrates has changed dramatically since the construction of the first dams in the 19
70 s. Data on Euphrates discharge collected after 1990 show the impact of the construction of the numerous dams in the Euphrates and of the increased withdrawal of water for irrigation. Average discharge at Ht after 1990 has dropped to 356 cubic metres 12600 cu ft per second 
11.2  cubic kilometres 
2.7  cu mi per year. The seasonal variability has equally changed. The pre1990 peak volume recorded at Ht was 7510 cubic metres 265000 cu ft per second while after 1990 it is only 2514 cubic metres 88800 cu ft per second. The minimum volume at Ht remained relatively unchanged rising from 55 cubic metres 1900 cu ft per second before 1990 to 58 cubic metres 2000 cu ft per second afterward.2021 Tributariesedit View of the Murat River In Syria three rivers add their water to the Euphrates the Sajur the Balikh and the Khabur. These rivers rise in the foothills of the Taurus Mountains along the SyroTurkish border and add comparatively little water to the Euphrates. The Sajur is the smallest of these tributaries emerging from two streams near Gaziantep and draining the plain around Manbij before emptying into the reservoir of the Tishrin Dam. The Balikh receives most of its water from a karstic spring near Ayn alArus and flows due south until it reaches the Euphrates at the city of Raqqa. In terms of length drainage basin and discharge the Khabur is the largest of these three. Its main karstic springs are located around Ras alAyn from where the Khabur flows southeast past AlHasakah where the river turns south and drains into the Euphrates near Busayrah. Once the Euphrates enters Iraq there are no more natural tributaries to the Euphrates although canals connecting the Euphrates basin with the Tigris basin exist.2223 Name Length Watershed size Discharge Bank Kara Su 450 km 280 mi 22000 km2 8500 sq mi Confluence Murat River 650 km 400 mi 40000 km2 15000 sq mi Confluence Sajur River 108 km 67 mi 2042 km2 788 sq mi

According to both Daoudy and Frenken Turkeys share is 28 percent Syrias is 17 percent and that of Iraq is 40 percent.1112 Isaev and Mikhailova estimate the percentages of the drainage basin lying within Turkey Syria and Iraq at 33 20 and 47 percent respectively.13 Some sources estimate that approximately 15 percent of the drainage basin is located within Saudi Arabia while a small part falls inside the borders of Kuwait.1112 Finally some sources also include Jordan in the drainage basin of the Euphrates a small part of the eastern desert 220 square kilometres 85 sq mi drains toward the east rather than to the west.1326 Climate changeedit In 2021 the Iraqi Ministry of Water Resources reported that the Euphrates river could dry out by 2040 due to climate change and droughts.27 Natural historyedit See also Mesopotamian Marshes Rafetus euphraticus The Euphrates flows through a number of distinct vegetation zones. Although millennialong human occupation in most parts of the Euphrates basin has significantly degraded the landscape patches of original vegetation remain. The steady drop in annual rainfall from the sources of the Euphrates toward the Persian Gulf is a strong determinant for the vegetation that can be supported. In its upper reaches the Euphrates flows through the mountains of Southeast Turkey and their southern foothills which support a xeric woodland. Plant species in the moister parts of this zone include various oaks pistachio trees and Rosaceae roseplum family. The drier parts of the xeric woodland zone supports less dense oak forest and Rosaceae. Here can also be found the wild variants of many cereals including einkorn wheat emmer oat and rye.28 South of this zone lies a zone of mixed woodlandsteppe vegetation. Between Raqqa and the SyroIraqi border the Euphrates flows through a steppe landscape. This steppe is characterised by white wormwood Artemisia herbaalba and Amaranthaceae. Throughout history this zone has been heavily overgrazed due to the practicing of sheep and goat pastoralism by its inhabitants.29 Southeast of the border between Syria and Iraq starts true desert. This zone supports either no vegetation at all or small pockets of Chenopodiaceae or Poa sinaica. Although today nothing of it survives due to human interference research suggests that the Euphrates Valley would have supported a riverine forest. Species characteristic of this type of forest include the Oriental plane the Euphrates poplar the tamarisk the ash and various wetland plants.30 Among the fish species in the TigrisEuphrates basin the family of the Cyprinidae are the most common with 34 species out of 52 in total.31 Among the Cyprinids the mangar has good recreational fishing qualities leading the British to nickname it the Tigris salmon. The Euphrates softshell turtle is an endangered softshelled turtle that is limited to the TigrisEuphrates river system.3233 The NeoAssyrian palace reliefs from the 
1 st millennium BCE depict lion and bull hunts in fertile landscapes.34 Sixteenth to nineteenth century European travellers in the Syrian Euphrates basin reported on an abundance of animals living in the area many of which have become rare or even extinct. Species like gazelle onager and the nowextinct Arabian ostrich lived in the steppe bordering the Euphrates valley while the valley itself was home to the wild boar. Carnivorous species include the wolf the golden jackal the red fox the leopard and the lion. The Syrian brown bear can be found in the mountains of Southeast Turkey. The presence of Eurasian beaver has been attested in the bone assemblage of the prehistoric site of Tell Abu Hureyra in Syria but the beaver has never been sighted in historical times.35 Riveredit Main articles Dams in Iraq Tabqa Dam and Southeastern Anatolia Project Map in French showing the locations of dams and barrages built in the SyroTurkish part of the Euphrates basin The Hindiya Barrage on the Iraqi Euphrates based on plans by British civil engineer William Willcocks and finished in 1913 was the first modern water diversion structure built in the TigrisEuphrates river system.36 The Hindiya Barrage was followed in the 19
50 s by the Ramadi Barrage and the nearby Abu Dibbis Regulator which serve to regulate the flow regime of the Euphrates and to discharge excess flood water into the depression that is now Lake Habbaniyah. Iraqs largest dam on the Euphrates is the Haditha Dam a 
9 kilometrelong 
5.6  mi earthfill dam creating Lake Qadisiyah.37 Syria and Turkey built their first dams in the Euphrates in the 19
70 s. The Tabqa Dam in Syria was completed in 1973 while Turkey finished the Keban Dam a prelude to the immense Southeastern Anatolia Project in 1974. Since then Syria has built two more dams in the Euphrates the Baath Dam and the Tishrin Dam and plans to build a fourth dam  the Halabiye Dam  between Raqqa and Deir ezZor.38 The Tabqa Dam is Syrias largest dam and its reservoir Lake Assad is an important source of irrigation and drinking water. It was planned that 640000 hectares 2500 sq mi should be irrigated from Lake Assad but in 2000 only 100000124000 hectares 390480 sq mi had been realized.3940 Syria also built three smaller dams on the Khabur and its tributaries.41 With the implementation of the Southeastern Anatolia Project Turkish Gneydou Anadolu Projesi or GAP in the 19
70 s Turkey launched an ambitious plan to harness the waters of the Tigris and the Euphrates for irrigation and hydroelectricity production and provide an economic stimulus to its southeastern provinces.42 GAP affects a total area of 75000 square kilometres 29000 sq mi and approximately 7 million people representing about 10 percent of Turkeys total surface area and population respectively. When completed GAP will consist of 22 dams  including the Keban Dam  and 19 power plants and provide irrigation water to 1700000 hectares 6600 sq mi of agricultural land which is about 20 percent of the irrigable land in Turkey.43 C. 910000 hectares 3500 sq mi of this irrigated land is located in the Euphrates basin.44 By far the largest dam in GAP is the Atatrk Dam located c. 55 kilometres 34 mi northwest of anlurfa. This 1
84 metrehigh 604 ft and 18
20 metrelong 5970 ft dam was completed in 1992 thereby creating a reservoir that is the thirdlargest lake in Turkey. With a maximum capacity of 
48.7  cubic kilometres 
11.7  cu mi the Atatrk Dam reservoir is large enough to hold the entire annual discharge of the Euphrates.45 Completion of GAP was scheduled for 2010 but has been delayed because the World Bank has withheld funding due to the lack of an official agreement on water sharing between Turkey and the downstream states on the Euphrates and the Tigris.46 Apart from barrages and dams Iraq has also created an intricate network of canals connecting the Euphrates with Lake Habbaniyah Lake Tharthar and Abu Dibbis reservoir all of which can be used to store excess floodwater. Via the Shatt alHayy the Euphrates is connected with the Tigris. The largest canal in this network is the Main Outfall Drain or socalled Third River constructed between 1953 and 1992. This 5
65 kilometrelong 351 mi canal is intended to drain the area between the Euphrates and the Tigris south of Baghdad to prevent soil salinization from irrigation. It also allows large freight barges to navigate up to Baghdad.474849 Environmental and social effectsedit See also Environmental impact of reservoirs Keban Dam in Turkey the first dam on the Euphrates after it emerges from the confluence of the Kara Su and the Murat Su Qalat Jabar in Syria once perched on a hilltop overlooking the Euphrates valley but now turned into an island by the flooding of Lake Assad The construction of the dams and irrigation schemes on the Euphrates has had a significant impact on the environment and society of each riparian country. The dams constructed as part of GAP  in both the Euphrates and the Tigris basins  have affected 382 villages and almost 200000 people have been resettled elsewhere. The largest number of people was displaced by the building of the Atatrk Dam which alone affected 55300 people.50 A survey among those who were displaced showed that the majority were unhappy with their new situation and that the compensation they had received was considered insufficient.51 The flooding of Lake Assad led to the forced displacement of c. 4000 families who were resettled in other parts of northern Syria as part of a now abandoned plan to create an Arab belt along the borders with Turkey and Iraq.525354 Apart from the changes in the discharge regime of the river the numerous dams and irrigation projects have also had other effects on the environment. The creation of reservoirs with large surfaces in countries with high average temperatures has led to increased evaporation thereby reducing the total amount of water that is available for human use. Annual evaporation from reservoirs has been estimated at 2 cubic kilometres 
0.4 8 cu mi in Turkey 1 cubic kilometre 
0.2 4 cu mi in Syria and 5 cubic kilometres 
1.2  cu mi in Iraq.55 Water quality in the Iraqi Euphrates is low because irrigation water tapped in Turkey and Syria flows back into the river together with dissolved fertilizer chemicals used on the fields.56 The salinity of Euphrates water in Iraq has increased as a result of upstream dam construction leading to lower suitability as drinking water.57 The many dams and irrigation schemes and the associated largescale water abstraction have also had a detrimental effect on the ecologically already fragile Mesopotamian Marshes and on freshwater fish habitats in Iraq.5859 The inundation of large parts of the Euphrates valley especially in Turkey and Syria has led to the flooding of many archaeological sites and other places of cultural significance.60 Although concerted efforts have been made to record or save as much of the endangered cultural heritage as possible many sites are probably lost forever. The combined GAP projects on the Turkish Euphrates have led to major international efforts to document the archaeological and cultural heritage of the endangered parts of the valley. Especially the flooding of Zeugma with its unique Roman mosaics by the reservoir of the Birecik Dam has generated much controversy in both the Turkish and international press.6162 The construction of the Tabqa Dam in Syria led to a large international campaign coordinated by UNESCO to document the heritage that would disappear under the waters of Lake Assad. Archaeologists from numerous countries excavated sites ranging in date from the Natufian to the Abbasid period and two minarets were dismantled and rebuilt outside the flood zone. Important sites that have been flooded or affected by the rising waters of Lake Assad include Mureybet Emar and Abu Hureyra.63 A similar international effort was made when the Tishrin Dam was constructed which led among others to the flooding of the important PrePottery Neolithic B site of Jerf el Ahmar.64 An archaeological survey and rescue excavations were also carried out in the area flooded by Lake Qadisiya in Iraq.65 Parts of the flooded area have recently become accessible again due to the drying up of the lake resulting not only in new possibilities for archaeologists to do more research but also providing opportunities for looting which has been rampant elsewhere in Iraq in the wake of the 2003 invasion.66 Religionedit Islamedit In Islam hadiths say Muhammad said The Last Hour would not come before the Euphrates uncovers a mountain of gold for which people would fight. Ninetynine out of each one hundred would die but every man amongst them would say that perhaps he would be the one who would be saved and that he who finds it the gold should not take anything out of that.67 This is said to be one of the future minor signs of the coming of Judgement Day68 Christianityedit In the Christian Bible the Euphrates River is mentioned in Revelation 1612 in the final book of the New Testament. Author John of Patmos writes about the Euphrates river drying up as part of a series of events that foretell the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.69 The river Phrath mentioned in Genesis 214 is also identified as the Euphrates.70 Historyedit Further information History of Mesopotamia and History of Iraq A fishing boat in the Euphrates Southern Iraq Palaeolithic to Chalcolithic periodsedit The early occupation of the Euphrates basin was limited to its upper reaches that is the area that is popularly known as the Fertile Crescent. Acheulean stone artifacts have been found in the Sajur basin and in the El Kowm oasis in the central Syrian steppe the latter together with remains of Homo erectus that were dated to 450000 years old.7172 In the Taurus Mountains and the upper part of the Syrian Euphrates valley early permanent villages such as Abu Hureyra  at first occupied by huntergatherers but later by some of the earliest farmers Jerf el Ahmar Mureybet and Neval ori became established from the eleventh millennium BCE onward.73 In the absence of irrigation these early farming communities were limited to areas where rainfed agriculture was possible that is the upper parts of the Syrian Euphrates as well as Turkey.74 Late Neolithic villages characterized by the introduction of pottery in the early 
7 th millennium BCE are known throughout this area.75 Occupation of lower Mesopotamia started in the 
6 th millennium and is generally associated with the introduction of irrigation as rainfall in this area is insufficient for dry agriculture. Evidence for irrigation has been found at several sites dating to this period including Tell esSawwan.76 During the 
5 th millennium BCE or late Ubaid period northeastern Syria was dotted by small villages although some of them grew to a size of over 10 hectares 25 acres.77 In Iraq sites like Eridu and Ur were already occupied during the Ubaid period.78 Clay boat models found at Tell Mashnaqa along the Khabur indicate that riverine transport was already practiced during this period.79 The Uruk period roughly coinciding with the 
4 th millennium BCE saw the emergence of truly urban settlements across Mesopotamia. Cities like Tell Brak and Uruk grew to over 100 hectares 250 acres in size and displayed monumental architecture.80 The spread of southern Mesopotamian pottery architecture and sealings far into Turkey and Iran has generally been interpreted as the material reflection of a widespread trade system aimed at providing the Mesopotamian cities with raw materials. Habuba Kabira on the Syrian Euphrates is a prominent example of a settlement that is interpreted as an Uruk colony.8182 Ancient historyedit During the Jemdet Nasr 36003100 BCE and Early Dynastic periods 31002350 BCE southern Mesopotamia experienced a growth in the number and size of settlements suggesting strong population growth. These settlements including SumeroAkkadian sites like Sippar Uruk Adab and Kish were organized in competing citystates.83 Many of these cities were located along canals of the Euphrates and the Tigris that have since dried up but that can still be identified from remote sensing imagery.84 A similar development took place in Upper Mesopotamia Subartu and Assyria although only from the mid 
3 rd millennium and on a smaller scale than in Lower Mesopotamia. Sites like Ebla Mari and Tell Leilan grew to prominence for the first time during this period.85 Large parts of the Euphrates basin were for the first time united under a single ruler during the Akkadian Empire 23352154 BC and Ur III empires which controlled  either directly or indirectly through vassals  large parts of modernday Iraq and northeastern Syria.86 Following their collapse the Old Assyrian Empire 19751750 BCE and Mari asserted their power over northeast Syria and northern Mesopotamia while southern Mesopotamia was controlled by citystates like Isin Kish and Larsa before their territories were absorbed by the newly emerged state of Babylonia under Hammurabi in the early to mid 
18 th century BCE.87 In the second half of the 
2 nd millennium BCE the Euphrates basin was divided between Kassite Babylon in the south and Mitanni Assyria and the Hittite Empire in the north with the Middle Assyrian Empire 13651020 BC eventually eclipsing the Hittites Mitanni and Kassite Babylonians.88 Following the end of the Middle Assyrian Empire in the late 
11 th century BCE struggles broke out between Babylonia and Assyria over the control of the Iraqi Euphrates basin. The NeoAssyrian Empire 935605 BC eventually emerged victorious out of this conflict and also succeeded in gaining control of the northern Euphrates basin in the first half of the 
1 st millennium BCE.89 In the centuries to come control of the wider Euphrates basin shifted from the NeoAssyrian Empire which collapsed between 612 and 599 BC to the short lived Median Empire 612546 BC and equally brief NeoBabylonian Empire 612539 BC in the last years of the 
7 th century BC and eventually to the Achaemenid Empire 539333 BC.90 The Achaemenid Empire was in turn overrun by Alexander the Great who defeated the last king Darius III and died in Babylon in 323 BCE.91 Subsequent to this the region came under the control of the Seleucid Empire 312150 BC Parthian Empire 150226 AD during which several NeoAssyrian states such as Adiabene came to rule certain regions of the Euphrates and was fought over by the Roman Empire its succeeding Byzantine Empire and the Sassanid Empire 226638 AD until the Islamic conquest of the mid 
7 th century AD. The Battle of Karbala took place near the banks of this river in 680 AD. In the north the river served as a border between Greater Armenia 331 BC428 AD and Lesser Armenia the latter became a Roman province in the 
1 st century BC. Modern eraedit See also Water politics in the Middle East Wooden bridge carrying the Baghdad Railway over the Euphrates c.19001910 After World War I the borders in Southwest Asia were redrawn in the Treaty of Lausanne 1923 when the Ottoman Empire was partitioned. Clause 109 of the treaty stipulated that the three riparian states of the Euphrates at that time Turkey France for its Syrian mandate and the United Kingdom for its mandate of Iraq had to reach a mutual agreement on the use of its water and on the construction of any hydraulic installation.92 An agreement between Turkey and Iraq signed in 1946 required Turkey to report to Iraq on any hydraulic changes it made on the TigrisEuphrates river system and allowed Iraq to construct dams on Turkish territory to manage the flow of the Euphrates.93 Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Iraq 19321959 depicting the two rivers the confluence Shatt alArab and the date palm forest which used to be the largest in the world The river featured on the coat of arms of Iraq from 1932 to 1959. Euphrates near Kahta Turkey and Syria completed their first dams on the Euphrates  the Keban Dam and the Tabqa Dam respectively  within one year of each other and filling of the reservoirs commenced in 1975. At the same time the area was hit by severe drought and river flow toward Iraq was reduced from 
15.3  cubic kilometres 
3.7  cu mi in 1973 to 
9.4  cubic kilometres 
2.3  cu mi in 1975. This led to an international crisis during which Iraq threatened to bomb the Tabqa Dam. An agreement was eventually reached between Syria and Iraq after intervention by Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union.9495 A similar crisis although not escalating to the point of military threats occurred in 1981 when the Keban Dam reservoir had to be refilled after it had been almost emptied to temporarily increase Turkeys hydroelectricity production.96 In 1984 Turkey unilaterally declared that it would ensure a flow of at least 500 cubic metres 18000 cu ft per second or 16 cubic kilometres 
3.8  cu mi per year into Syria and in 1987 a bilateral treaty to that effect was signed between the two countries.97 Another bilateral agreement from 1989 between Syria and Iraq settles the amount of water flowing into Iraq at 60 percent of the amount that Syria receives from Turkey.939598 In 2008 Turkey Syria and Iraq instigated the Joint Trilateral Committee JTC on the management of the water in the TigrisEuphrates basin and on 3 September 2009 a further agreement was signed to this effect.99 On 15 April 2014 Turkey began to reduce the flow of the Euphrates into Syria and Iraq. The flow was cut off completely on 16 May 2014 resulting in the Euphrates terminating at the TurkishSyrian border.100 This was in violation of an agreement reached in 1987 in which Turkey committed to releasing a minimum of 500 cubic metres 18000 cu ft of water per second at the TurkishSyrian border.101 Euphrates in Iraq 2005 During the Syrian civil war and the Iraqi Civil War much of the Euphrates was controlled by the Islamic State from 2014 until 2017 when the terrorist group began losing land and was eventually defeated territorially in Syria at the Battle of Baghouz and in Iraq in the Western Iraq offensive respectively.102 Economyedit See also List of cities and towns on the Euphrates River Throughout history the Euphrates has been of vital importance to those living along its course. With the construction of large hydropower stations irrigation schemes and pipelines capable of transporting water over large distances many more people now depend on the river for basic amenities such as electricity and drinking water than in the past. Syrias Lake Assad is the most important source of drinking water for the city of Aleppo 75 kilometres 47 mi to the west of the river valley.103 The lake also supports a modest stateoperated fishing industry.104 Through a newly restored power line the Haditha Dam in Iraq provides electricity to Baghdad.105 See alsoedit Armenian highlands Mountains of Ararat Zagros Mountains Referencesedit  Euphrates River  Definition Location  Facts  Britannica.
