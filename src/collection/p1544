Various points are offered as the beginning for the latter era though it is most often regarded as dating from the foundation of the TwentySixth Dynasty by Psamtik I in 664 BC following the departure of the Nubian Kushite rulers of the Twentyfifth Dynasty after they were driven out by the Assyrians under King Ashurbanipal. The use of the term Third Intermediate Period1 based on the analogy of the wellknown First and Second Intermediate Periods was popular by 1978 when British Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen used the term for the title of his book on the period. While Kitchen argued that the period was far from being chaotic and hoped that his work would lead to the abolishment of the term with his own preference being the PostImperial epoch his use of the term as a title seems only to have entrenched the use of the term.2 The period was ruled by nonnative Egyptians and is viewed as one of decline and political instability including division of the state coinciding with the Late Bronze Age collapse of civilizations in the ancient Near East and Eastern Mediterranean including the Greek Dark Ages. Historyedit Twentyfirst Dynastyedit Main article Twentyfirst Dynasty of Egypt The period of the Twentyfirst Dynasty is characterized by the countrys fracturing kingship. Already during Ramesses XIs reign the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt was losing its grip on the city of Thebes whose priests were becoming increasingly powerful. After his death his successor Smendes I ruled from the city of Tanis but was mostly active only in Lower Egypt which he controlled. Meanwhile the High Priests of Amun at Thebes ruled Middle and Upper Egypt in all but name.2 However this division was less significant than it seems since both the priests and pharaohs came from the same family. Twentysecond and Twentythird Dynastyedit Main articles Twentysecond Dynasty of Egypt and Twentythird Dynasty of Egypt The country was firmly reunited by the Twentysecond Dynasty founded by Shoshenq I in 945 BC or 943 BC who descended from Meshwesh immigrants originally from ancient Libya.a This brought stability to the country for well over a century but after the reign of Osorkon II particularly the country had effectively split into two states with Shoshenq III of the Twentysecond Dynasty controlling Lower Egypt by 818 BC while Takelot II and his son Osorkon the future Osorkon III ruled Middle and Upper Egypt. In Thebes a civil war engulfed the city pitting the forces of Pedubast I who had proclaimed himself pharaoh against the existing line of Takelot IIOsorkon B. The two factions squabbled continuously and the conflict was only resolved in Year 39 of Shoshenq III when Osorkon B comprehensively defeated his enemies. He proceeded to found the Upper Egyptian Libyan Twentythird Dynasty of Osorkon III  Takelot III  Rudamun but this kingdom quickly fragmented after Rudamuns death with the rise of local city states under kings such as Peftjaubast of Herakleopolis Nimlot of Hermopolis and Ini at Thebes. Twentyfourth Dynastyedit Main article Twentyfourth Dynasty of Egypt The Nubian kingdom to the south took full advantage of this division and the ensuing political instability. Prior to Piyes Year 20 campaign into Egypt the previous Nubian ruler  Kashta  had already extended his kingdoms influence into Thebes when he compelled Shepenupet the serving Divine Adoratice of Amun and Takelot IIIs sister to adopt his own daughter Amenirdis to be her successor. Then 20 years later around 732 BC his successor Piye marched north and defeated the combined might of several native Egyptian rulers Peftjaubast Osorkon IV of Tanis Iuput II of Leontopolis and Tefnakht of Sais. Twentyfifth Dynastyedit Main article Twentyfifth Dynasty of Egypt 
25 th Dynasty Piye established the Twentyfifth Dynasty and appointed the defeated rulers as his provincial governors. He was succeeded first by his brother Shabaka and then by his two sons Shebitku and Taharqa. The reunited Nile valley empire of the 
25 th Dynasty was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom. Pharaohs of the dynasty among them Taharqa built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley including at Memphis Karnak Kawa and Jebel Barkal.56 The 
25 th Dynasty ended with its rulers retreating to their spiritual homeland at Napata. It was there at ElKurru and Nuri that all 
25 th Dynasty pharaohs were buried under the first pyramids to be constructed in the Nile valley in hundreds of years.78910 The Napatan dynasty led to the Kingdom of Kush which flourished in Napata and Meroe until at least the 
2 nd century AD.7 The international prestige of Egypt had declined considerably by this time. The countrys international allies had fallen firmly into the sphere of influence of Assyria and from about 700 BC the question became when not if there would be war between the two states as Esarhaddon had realised that a conquest of Lower Egypt was necessary to protect Assyrian interests in the Levant. Despite Egypts size and wealth Assyria had a greater supply of timber while Egypt had a chronic shortage allowing Assyria to produce more charcoal needed for ironsmelting and thus giving Assyria a greater supply of iron weaponry. This disparity became critical during the Assyrian invasions of Egypt over the period 670663 BC.11 Consequently pharaoh Taharqas reign and that of his successor Tantamani were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians. In 664 BC the Assyrians delivered a mortal blow sacking Thebes and Memphis. Following these events and starting with Atlanersa no Kushite ruler would ever rule over Egypt again. End of the Third Intermediate Periodedit Upper Egypt remained for a time under the rule of Taharqa and Tantamani whilst Lower Egypt was ruled from 664 BC by the nascent 
26 th Dynasty client kings established by the Assyrians. In 663 BC Tantamani launched a fullscale invasion of Lower Egypt taking Memphis in April of this year killing Necho I of Sais in the process as Necho had remained loyal to Ashurbanipal. Tantamani barely had the time to receive the submission of some Delta kinglets and expel the remaining Assyrians that a large army led by Ashurbanipal and Nechos son Psamtik I came back. Tantamani was defeated north of Memphis and Thebes was thoroughly sacked shortly after. The Kushite king withdrew to Nubia while the Assyrian influence in Upper Egypt quickly waned. Permanently weakened by the sack Thebes peacefully submitted itself to Psamtiks fleet in 656 BC. To affirm his authority Psamtik placed his daughter in position to be the future Divine Adoratrice of Amun thereby also submitting the priesthood of Amun and effectively uniting Egypt. Tantamanis successor Atlanersa was in no position to attempt a reconquest of Egypt as Psamtik also secured the southern border at Elephantine and may even have sent a military campaign to Napata. Concurrently Psamtik managed to free himself from the Assyrian vassalage while remaining on good terms with Ashurbanipal possibly owing to an ongoing rebellion in Babylon. By doing so he brought increased stability to the country during his 
54 year reign from the city of Sais beginning the Late Period of ancient Egypt. Historiographyedit The historiography of this period is disputed for a variety of reasons. Firstly there is a dispute about the utility of a very artificial term that covers an extremely long and complicated period of Egyptian history. The Third Intermediate Period includes long periods of stability as well as chronic instability and civil conflict its very name rather clouds this fact. Secondly there are significant problems of chronology stemming from several areas there are the difficulties in dating that are common to all of Egyptian chronology and are compounded by synchronisms with Biblical archaeology that also contain heavily disputed dates. Fringe theoriesedit Peter James along with several other academics argued contra Kitchen that the period lasted less than 200 years starting later than 850 BC but ending at the conventional date as the five dynasties had many years of overlap.12 Some theorists such as David Rohl have controversial theories about the family relationships of the dynasties comprising the period.
