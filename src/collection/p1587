13 th century BCE Abandoned Approximately 1060 BCE Periods New Kingdom to Third Intermediate Period PiRamesses prms Ancient Egyptian prrmssw meaning House of Ramesses1 was the new capital built by the Nineteenth Dynasty Pharaoh Ramesses II 12791213 BCE at Qantir near the old site of Avaris. The city had served as a summer palace under Seti I c. 12901279 BCE and may have been founded by Ramesses I c. 12921290 BCE while he served under Horemheb. Discoveryedit Map of Lower Egypt showing Tanis and Avaris near PiRamesses prrmssw2 in hieroglyphs In 1884 Flinders Petrie arrived in Egypt to begin his excavations there. His first dig was at Tanis where he arrived with 170 workmen. Later in the 19
30 s the ruins at Tanis were explored by Pierre Montet. The masses of broken Ramesside stonework at Tanis led archaeologists to identify it as PiRamesses. Yet it eventually came to be recognised that none of these monuments and inscriptions originated at the site.3 In the 19
60 s Manfred Bietak recognised that PiRamesses was known to have been located on the theneasternmost branch of the Nile. He painstakingly mapped all the branches of the ancient Delta and established that the Pelusiac branch was the easternmost during Ramesses reign while the Tanitic branch i.e. the branch on which Tanis was located did not exist at all. Excavations were therefore begun at the site of the highest Ramesside pottery location Tell elDaba and Qantir. Although there were no traces of any previous habitation visible on the surface discoveries soon identified Tell elDaba as the Hyksos capital Avaris. Qantir was recognized as the site of the Ramesside capital PiRamesses.4 QantirPiRamesses lies some 30 km 19 mi to the south of Tanis Tell elDaba the site of Avaris is situated about 2 km 
1.2  mi south of Qantir.3 In 2017 archaeologists from the Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum unearthed footprints of children at the bottom of a mortar part5 as well as pieces of painted wall possibly fresco pending further study believed to have served as decoration at the site of a palace or temple.6 Historyedit Ramesses II was born and raised in the area and family connections may have played a part in his decision to move his capital so far north but geopolitical reasons may have been of greater importance as PiRamesses was much closer to the Egyptian vassal states in Asia and to the border with the hostile Hittite empire. Intelligence and diplomats would reach the pharaoh much more quickly and the main corps of the army were also encamped in the city and could quickly be mobilised to deal with incursions of Hittites or Shasu nomads from across the Jordan.7 PiRamesses was built on the banks of the Pelusiac branch of the Nile. With a population of over 300000 it was one of the largest cities of ancient Egypt. PiRamesses flourished for more than a century after Ramesses death and poems were written about its splendour. According to the latest estimates the city was spread over about 18 km2 
6.9  sq mi or around 6 km 
3.7  mi long by 3 km 
1.9  mi wide. Its layout as shown by groundpenetrating radar consisted of a huge central temple a large precinct of mansions bordering the river in the west set in a rigid grid pattern of streets and a disorderly collection of houses and workshops in the east. The palace of Ramesses is believed to lie beneath the modern village of Qantir. An Austrian team of archaeologists headed by Manfred Bietak who discovered the site found evidence of many canals and lakes and have described the city as the Venice of Egypt. A surprising discovery in the excavated stables were small cisterns located adjacent to each of the estimated 460 horse tether points. Using mules which are the same size as the horses of Ramesses day it was found a double tethered horse would naturally use the cistern as a toilet leaving the stable floor clean and dry.8 It was originally thought the demise of Egyptian authority abroad during the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt made the city less significant leading to its abandonment as a royal residence.9 It is now known that the Pelusiac branch of the Nile began silting up c. 1060 BCE leaving the city without water when the river eventually established a new course to the west now called the Tanitic branch. 10 The Twentyfirst Dynasty of Egypt moved the city to the new branch establishing Djanet Tanis on its banks 100 km 62 mi to the northwest of PiRamesses as the new capital of Lower Egypt. The pharaohs of the Twentyfirst Dynasty transported all the old Ramesside temples obelisks stelae statues and sphinxes from PiRamesses to the new site. The obelisks and statues the largest weighing over 200 tons were transported in one piece while major buildings were dismantled into sections and reassembled at Tanis. Stone from the less important buildings was reused and recycled for the creation of new temples and buildings.8 Biblical Raamsesedit Chapter 47 of the biblical Book of Genesis states that the Hebrews were given the Land of Goshen to reside in but also that Joseph settled his father and brothers in the best part of the land in the land of Rameses. The Book of Exodus mentions Raamses or Ramesses1112 both spellings appear in the Masoretic Text Hebrew  romanized Ramss as one of the cities on whose construction the Israelites were forced to labour Exodus 111 and from where they departed on their Exodus journey Exodus 1237 and Numbers 333. Understandably this Ramesses has been identified by modern biblical archaeologists with the PiRamesses of Ramesses II.13 Still earlier the 
10 thcentury Bible exegete Rabbi Saadia Gaon believed that the biblical site of Ramesses had to be identified with Ain Shams.14 When the 
21 st Dynasty moved the capital to Tanis PiRamesses was largely abandoned and the old capital became a quarry for readymade monuments but it was not forgotten. Its name appears in a list of 
21 st Dynasty cities and it had a revival under Shishaq usually identified with the historical pharaoh Shoshenq I15 of the 
22 nd Dynasty 
10 th century BCE who tried to emulate the achievements of Ramesses. The existence of the city as Egypts capital as late as the 
10 th century BCE makes problematic the claim that the reference to Ramesses in the Exodus story is a memory of the era of Ramesses II in fact it has been claimed that the shortened form Ramesses in place of the original PiRamesses is first found in 
1 st millennium BCE texts3 although it also appears in texts from the 
2 nd millennium BCE.1334 Ramesses II moved the capital of Egypt to PiRamesses because of its military potential thus he built storehouses docks and military facilities in the city which could explain why Exodus 111 calls the site a treasure city.16 See alsoedit List of ancient Egyptian towns and cities List of historical capitals of Egypt Notesedit  Tyldesley Joyce October 30 2001.
