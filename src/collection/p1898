She married Demetrius thus giving him the throne of Cyrenaica on the death of her father Magas in 250249 BCE. After a short power struggle with her mother Berenice married her halfcousin Ptolemy III the third ruler of the Ptolemaic kingdom. This marriage led to the reincorporation of Cyrenaica into the Ptolemaic empire. As queen of Egypt Berenice participated actively in government was incorporated into the Ptolemaic state cult alongside her husband and worshipped as a goddess in her own right. She is best known for sacrificing her hair as a votive offering which led to the constellation Coma Berenices being named after her. Berenice was murdered by the regent Sosibius shortly after the accession of her son Ptolemy IV Philopator in 221 BCE. Lifeedit Cyrenaica had been incorporated into the Ptolemaic realm in 323 BCE by Ptolemy I Soter shortly after the death of Alexander the Great. The region proved difficult to control and around 300 BCE Ptolemy I entrusted the region to Magas son of his wife Berenice I by an earlier marriage. After Ptolemy Is death Magas asserted his independence and engaged in warfare with his successor Ptolemy II Philadelphus. Around 275 BCE Magas married Apama who came from the Seleucid dynasty which had become enemies of the Ptolemies.5 Berenice II was their only child. When Ptolemy II renewed his efforts to reach a settlement with Magas of Cyrene in the late 2
50 s BCE it was agreed that Berenice would be married to her halfcousin the future Ptolemy III who was Ptolemy IIs heir.67 The astronomer Gaius Julius Hyginus claims that when Berenices father and his troops were routed in battle Berenice mounted a horse rallied the remaining forces killed many of the enemy and drove the rest to retreat.8 The veracity of this story is unclear and the battle in question is not otherwise attested but it is not on the face of it impossible.9 Queen of Cyreneedit Berenice was hailed basilissa queen on coins even in her fathers lifetime.10 There are Cyrenean coins with the portrait of queen the legend   Berenice Basilissa and the monogram of Magas. It is evidently more plausible that the queens identity is Magass daughter Berenice II rather than Magass mother Berenice I because the portrait is youthful and unveiled meaning unmarried.11 According to coins of Berenice the accession of Berenice as queen of Cyrene was in 258 BCE.12 King Magas died in circa 250 BCE. At this point Berenices mother Apame refused to honour the marriage agreement with the Ptolemies and invited an Antigonid prince Demetrius the Fair to Cyrene to marry Berenice instead. With Apames help Demetrius seized control of the city. Allegedly Demetrius and Apame became lovers. Berenice is said to have discovered them in bed together and had him assassinated. Apame was spared.13 Control of Cyrene was then entrusted to a republican government led by two Cyrenaeans named Ecdelus and Demophanes until Berenices actual wedding to Ptolemy III in 246 BCE after his accession to the throne.714 It seems most probable that Berenice conceded a certain degree of autonomy to Cyrene.15 Queen of Egyptedit Coin of Berenice II A mosaic from Thmuis Mendes Egypt created by the Hellenistic artist Sophilos signature in about 200 BCE now in the GrecoRoman Museum in Alexandria Egypt the woman depicted is probably Berenice II. Her crown showing a ships prow and her anchorshaped brooch symbolised the Ptolemaic Empires naval prowess.16 A seated woman in a fresco from the Roman Villa Boscoreale dated mid
1 st century BCE that likely represents Berenice II of Ptolemaic Egypt wearing a stephane i.e. royal diadem on her head17 Berenice married Ptolemy III in 246 BCE after his accession to the throne.14 This brought Cyrenaica back into the Ptolemaic realm where it would remain until her greatgreatgrandson Ptolemy Apion left it to the Roman Republic in his will in 96 BCE. Ruler cultedit In 244 or 243 BCE Berenice and her husband were incorporated into the Ptolemaic state cults and worshipped as the Theoi Euergetai Benefactor Gods alongside Alexander the Great and the earlier Ptolemies.1418 Berenice was also worshipped as a goddess on her own Thea Euergetis Benefactor Goddess. She was often equated with Aphrodite and Isis and came to be particularly associated with protection against shipwrecks. Most of the evidence for this cult derives from the reign of Ptolemy IV or later but a cult in her honour is attested in the Fayyum in Ptolemy IIIs reign.19 This cult closely parallels that offered to her motherinlaw Arsinoe II who was also equated with Aphrodite and Isis and associated with protection from shipwrecks. The parallelism is also presented on the gold coinage minted posthumously in honour of the two queens. The coinage of Arsinoe II bears a pair of cornucopiae on the reverse side while that of Berenice bears a single cornucopia. Berenices Lockedit Main article Coma Berenices Coma Berenices constellation noted Berenices divinity is closely connected with the story of Berenices Lock. According to this story Berenice vowed to sacrifice her long hair as a votive offering if Ptolemy III returned safely from battle during the Third Syrian War. She dedicated her tresses to and placed them in the temple at Cape Zephyrium in Alexandria where Arsinoe II was worshipped as Aphrodite but the next morning the tresses had disappeared. Conon of Samos the court astronomer identified a constellation as the missing hair claiming that Aphrodite had placed it in the sky as an acknowledgement of Berenices sacrifice. The constellation is known to this day as Coma Berenices Latin for Berenices Lock.20 It is unclear whether this event took place before or after Ptolemys return Branko van Oppen de Ruiter suggests that it happened after Ptolemys return around MarchJune or May 245 BCE.21 This episode served to link Berenice with the goddess Isis in her role as goddess of rebirth since she was meant to have dedicated a lock of her own hair at Koptos in mourning for her husband Osiris.2219 The story was widely propagated by the Ptolemaic court. Seals were produced depicting Berenice with a shaved head and the attributes of IsisDemeter.2319 The poet Callimachus who was based in the Ptolemaic court celebrated the event in a poem The Lock of Berenice of which only a few lines remain.24 The first century BCE Roman poet Catullus produced a loose translation or adaptation of the poem in Latin25 and a prose summary appears in Hyginus De Astronomica.820 The story was popular in the early modern period when it was illustrated by many neoclassical painters. Panhellenic Gamesedit Berenice entered a chariot team in the Nemean Games of 243 or 241 BCE and was victorious. The success is celebrated in another poem by Callimachus Victory of Berenice. This poem connects Berenice with Io a lover of Zeus in Greek mythology who was also connected with Isis by contemporary Greeks.2619 When she won in the fourhorse chariot race at the Olympics in the early third century BCE she commissioned an epigram by the poet Posidippus in which she explicitly claimed to have stolen the fame  of Cynisca.27 Her epigram was included in the socalled Greek Anthology which also indicates its continuing relevance long after the victory itself.28 Deathedit Ptolemy III died in late 222 BCE and was succeeded by his son by Berenice Ptolemy IV Philopator. Berenice died soon after in early 221 BCE. Polybius states that she was poisoned as part of a general purge of the royal family by the new kings regent Sosibius.2914 She continued to be venerated in the state ruler cult. By 211 BCE she had her own priestess the athlophorus prizebearer who marched in processions in Alexandria behind the priest of Alexander the Great and the Ptolemies and the canephorus of the deified Arsinoe II.9 Legacyedit The city of Euesperides now the Libyan city of Benghazi was renamed Berenice in her honour a name it retained until the Middle Ages. The asteroid 653 Berenike discovered in 1907 also is named after Queen Berenice.30 Issueedit With Ptolemy III she had the following children31 Name Image Birth Death Notes Arsinoe III 2465 BCE 204 BCE Married her brother Ptolemy IV in 220 BCE.
