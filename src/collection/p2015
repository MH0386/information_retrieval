A member of the First Triumvirate Caesar led the Roman armies in the Gallic Wars before defeating his political rival Pompey in a civil war and subsequently became dictator from 49 BC until his assassination in 44 BC. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. In 60 BC Caesar Crassus and Pompey formed the First Triumvirate an informal political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass political power were opposed by many in the Senate among them Cato the Younger with the private support of Cicero. Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the Roman Republic through a string of military victories in the Gallic Wars completed by 51 BC which greatly extended Roman territory. During this time he both invaded Britain and built a bridge across the river Rhine. These achievements and the support of his veteran army threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. In 49 BC Caesar openly defied the Senates authority by crossing the Rubicon and marching towards Rome at the head of an army.3 This began Caesars civil war which he won leaving him in a position of nearunchallenged power and influence in 45 BC. After assuming control of government Caesar began a programme of social and governmental reform including the creation of the Julian calendar. He gave citizenship to many residents of far regions of the Roman Republic. He initiated land reforms to support his veterans and initiated an enormous building programme. In early 44 BC he was proclaimed dictator for life dictator perpetuo. Fearful of his power and domination of the state a group of senators led by Brutus and Cassius assassinated Caesar on the Ides of March 15 March 44 BC. A new series of civil wars broke out and the constitutional government of the Republic was never fully restored. Caesars greatnephew and adopted heir Octavian later known as Augustus rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the last civil war of the Roman Republic. Octavian set about solidifying his power and the era of the Roman Empire began. Caesar was an accomplished author and historian as well as a statesman much of his life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns. Other contemporary sources include the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust. Later biographies of Caesar by Suetonius and Plutarch are also important sources. Caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders in history.4 His cognomen was subsequently adopted as a synonym for Emperor the title Caesar was used throughout the Roman Empire giving rise to modern descendants such as Kaiser and Tsar. He has frequently appeared in literary and artistic works. Early life and career Main article Early life and career of Julius Caesar Gaius Marius Caesars uncle and the husband of Caesars aunt Julia. He was an enemy of Sulla and took the city with Lucius Cornelius Cinna in 87 BC. Gaius Julius Caesar was born into a patrician family the gens Julia on 12 July 100 BC.5 The family claimed to have immigrated to Rome from Alba Longa during the seventh century BC after the third king of Rome Tullus Hostilius took and destroyed their city. The family also claimed descent from Julus the son of Aeneas and founder of Alba Longa. Given that Aeneas was a son of Venus this made the clan divine. This genealogy had not yet taken its final form by the first century but the clans claimed descent from Venus was well established in public consciousness.6 There is no evidence that Caesar himself was born by Caesarian section such operations entailed the death of the mother but Caesars mother lived for decades after his birth and no ancient sources record any difficulty with the birth.7 Despite their ancient pedigree the Julii Caesares were not especially politically influential during the middle republic. The first person known to have had the cognomen Caesar was a praetor in 208 BC during the Second Punic War. The familys first consul was in 157 BC though their political fortunes had recovered in the early first century producing two consuls in 91 and 90 BC.8 Caesars homonymous father was moderately successful politically. He married Aurelia a member of the politically influential Aurelii Cottae producing  along with Caesar  two daughters. Buoyed by his own marriage and his sisters marriage the dictators aunt with the extremely influential Gaius Marius he also served on the Saturninian land commission in 103 BC and was elected praetor some time between 92 and 85 BC he served as proconsular governor of Asia for two years likely 9190 BC.9 Life under Sulla and military service Sulla depicted on a coin minted by Quintus Pompeius Rufus in 54 BC. Sulla took the city in 82 BC purged his political enemies and instituted new constitutional reforms. Caesars father did not seek a consulship during the domination of Lucius Cornelius Cinna and instead chose retirement.10 During Cinnas dominance Caesar was named as flamen Dialis a priest of Jupiter which led to his marriage to Cinnas daughter Cornelia. The religious taboos of the priesthood would have forced Caesar to forego a political career the appointment  one of the highest nonpolitical honours  indicates that there were few expectations of a major career for Caesar.11 In early 84 BC Caesars father died suddenly.12 After Sullas victory in the civil war 82 BC Cinnas acta were annulled. Sulla consequently ordered Caesar to abdicate and divorce Cinnas daughter. Caesar refused implicitly questioning the legitimacy of Sullas annulment. Sulla may have put Caesar on the proscription lists though scholars are mixed.13 Caesar then went into hiding before his relatives and contacts among the Vestal Virgins were able to intercede on his behalf.14 They then reached a compromise where Caesar would resign his priesthood but keep his wife and chattels Sullas alleged remark he saw in Caesar many Mariuses15 is apocryphal.16 Bust from the imperial period of a man  in this case Augustus  wearing the civic crown Latin corona civica. Caesar won the civic crown for his bravery at the Siege of Mytilene in 81 BC. Caesar then left Italy to serve in the staff of the governor of Asia Marcus Minucius Thermus. While there he travelled to Bithynia to collect naval reinforcements and stayed some time as a guest of the king Nicomedes IV though later invective connected Caesar to a homosexual relation with the monarch.1718 He then served at the Siege of Mytilene where he won the civic crown for saving the life of a fellow citizen in battle. The privileges of the crown  the Senate was supposed to stand on a holders entrance and holders were permitted to wear the crown at public occasions  whetted Caesars appetite for honours. After the capture of Mytilene Caesar transferred to the staff of Publius Servilius Vatia in Cilicia before learning of Sullas death in 78 BC and returning home immediately.19 He was alleged to have wanted to join in on the consul Lepidus revolt that year20 but this is likely literary embellishment of Caesars desire for tyranny from a young age.21 Afterward Caesar attacked some of the Sullan aristocracy in the courts but was unsuccessful in his attempted prosecution of Gnaeus Cornelius Dolabella in 77 BC who had recently returned from a proconsulship in Macedonia. Going after a less wellconnected senator he was successful the next year in prosecuting Gaius Antonius Hybrida later consul in 63 BC for profiteering from the proscriptions but was forestalled when a tribune interceded on Antonius behalf.22 After these oratorical attempts Caesar left Rome for Rhodes seeking the tutelage of the rhetorician Apollonius Molon.23 While travelling he was intercepted and ransomed by pirates in a story that was later much embellished. According to Plutarch and Suetonius he was freed after paying a ransom of fifty talents and responded by returning with a fleet to capture and execute the pirates. The recorded sum for the ransom is literary embellishment and it is more likely that the pirates were sold into slavery per Velleius Paterculus.24 His studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the Third Mithridatic War over the winter of 75 and 74 BC Caesar is alleged to have gone around collecting troops in the province at the locals expense and leading them successfully against Mithridates forces.25 Entrance to politics While absent from Rome in 73 BC Caesar was coopted into the pontifices in place of his deceased relative Gaius Aurelius Cotta. The promotion marked him as a wellaccepted member of the aristocracy with great future prospects in his political career.26 Caesar decided to return shortly thereafter and on his return was elected one of the military tribunes for 71 BC.27 There is no evidence that Caesar served in war  even though the war on Spartacus was ongoing  during his term he did however agitate for the removal of Sullas disabilities on the plebeian tribunate and for those who supported Lepidus revolt to be pardoned.28 These advocacies were common and uncontroversial.29 The next year 70 BC Pompey and Crassus were consuls and brought legislation restoring the plebeian tribunates rights one of the tribunes with Caesar supporting then brought legislation pardoning the Lepidan exiles.30 For his quaestorship in 69 BC Caesar was allotted to serve under Gaius Antistius Vetus in Hispania Ulterior. His election also gave him a lifetime seat in the Senate. However before he left his aunt Julia the widow of Marius died and soon afterwards his wife Cornelia died shortly after bearing his only legitimate child Julia. He gave eulogies for both at public funerals.31 During Julias funeral Caesar displayed the images of his aunts husband Marius whose memory had been suppressed after Sullas victory in the civil war. Some of the Sullan nobles  including Quintus Lutatius Catulus  who had suffered under the Marian regime objected but by this point depictions of husbands in aristocratic womens funerary processions was common.32 Contra Plutarch33 Caesars action here was likely in keeping with a political trend for reconciliation and normalisation rather than a display of renewed factionalism.34 Caesar quickly remarried taking the hand of Sullas granddaughter Pompeia.35 Aedileship and election as pontifex maximus For much of this period Caesar was one of Pompeys supporters. Caesar joined with Pompey in the late 
70 s to support restoration of tribunician rights his support for the law recalling the Lepidan exiles may have been related to the same tribunes bill to grant lands to Pompeys veterans. Caesar also supported the lex Gabinia in 67 BC granting Pompey an extraordinary command against piracy in the Mediterranean and also supported the lex Manilia in 66 BC to reassign the Third Mithridatic War from its thencommander Lucullus to Pompey.36 Denarius of C. Cossutius Maridianus 44 BC with the head of Julius Caesar as pontifex maximus on the obverse. The legend on the reverse mentions A. A. A. F. F. Four years after his aunt Julias funeral in 65 BC Caesar served as curule aedile and staged lavish games that won him further attention and popular support.37 He also restored the trophies won by Marius and taken down by Sulla over Jugurtha and the Cimbri.38 According to Plutarchs narrative the trophies were restored overnight to the applause and tears of joy of the onlookers any sudden and secret restoration of this sort would not have been possible  architects restorers and other workmen would have to have been hired and paid for  nor would it have been likely that the work could have been done in a single night.39 It is more likely that Caesar was merely restoring his familys public monuments  consistent with standard aristocratic practice and the virtue of pietas  and over objections from Catulus these actions were broadly supported by the Senate.40 In 63 BC Caesar stood for the praetorship and also for the post of pontifex maximus41 who was the head of the College of Pontiffs and the highest ranking state religious official. In the pontifical election before the tribes Caesar faced two influential senators Quintus Lutatius Catulus and Publius Servilius Isauricus. Caesar came out victorious. Many scholars have expressed astonishment that Caesars candidacy was taken seriously but this was not without historical precedent.42 Ancient sources allege that Caesar paid huge bribes or was shamelessly ingratiating43 that no charge was ever laid alleging this implies that bribery alone is insufficient to explain his victory.44 If bribes or other monies were needed they may have been underwritten by Pompey whom Caesar at this time supported and who opposed Catulus candidacy.45 Many sources also assert that Caesar supported the land reform proposals brought that year by plebeian tribune Publius Servilius Rullus however there are no ancient sources so attesting.46 Caesar also engaged in a collateral manner in the trial of Gaius Rabirius by one of the plebeian tribunes  Titus Labienus  for the murder of Saturninus in accordance with a senatus consultum ultimum some forty years earlier.4748 The most famous event of the year was the Catilinarian conspiracy. While some of Caesars enemies including Catulus alleged that he participated in the conspiracy49 the chance that he was a participant is extremely small.50 Praetorship Caesar won his election to the praetorship in 63 BC easily and as one of the praetorelects spoke out that December in the Senate against executing certain citizens who had been arrested in the city conspiring with Gauls in furtherance of the conspiracy.51 Caesars proposal at the time is not entirely clear. The earlier sources assert that he advocated life imprisonment without trial the later sources assert he instead wanted the conspirators imprisoned pending trial. Most accounts agree that Caesar supported confiscation of the conspirators property.52 Caesar likely advocated the former which was a compromise position that would place the Senate within the bounds of the lex Sempronia de capite civis and was initially successful in swaying the body a later intervention by Cato however swayed the Senate at the end for execution.53 Cicero consul in 63 BC depicted in an 1889 fresco denouncing Catiline and exposing his conspiracy before the Senate. When conspirators within the city were later arrested Cicero referred their fate to the Senate triggering a debate in which Caesar as praetorelect participated. During his year as praetor Caesar first attempted to deprive his enemy Catulus of the honour of completing the rebuilt Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus accusing him of embezzling funds and threatening to bring legislation to reassign it to Pompey. This proposal was quickly dropped amid nearuniversal opposition.54 He then supported the attempt by plebeian tribune Metellus Nepos to transfer the command against Catiline from the consul of 63 Gaius Antonius Hybrida to Pompey. After a violent meeting of the comitia tributa in the forum where Metellus came into fisticuffs with his tribunician colleagues Cato and Quintus Minucius Thermus55 the Senate passed a decree against Metellus  Suetonius claims that both Nepos and Caesar were deposed from their magistracies this would have been a constitutional impossibility56  which led Caesar to distance himself from the proposals hopes for a provincial command and need to repair relations with the aristocracy took priority.57 He also was engaged in the Bona Dea affair where Publius Clodius Pulcher snuck into Caesars house sacrilegiously during a female religious observance Caesar avoided any part of the affair by divorcing his wife immediately  claiming that his wife needed to be above suspicion58  but there is no indication that Caesar supported Clodius in any way.59 Bronze bust of Cato Caesars principal opponent in the Catilinarian debate and also a personal enemy. Cato may have been responsible for the law requiring declarations of candidacy in person within the pomerium.60 After his praetorship Caesar was appointed to govern Hispania Ulterior pro consule.61 Deeply indebted from his campaigns for the praetorship and for the pontificate Caesar required military victory beyond the normal provincial extortion to pay them off.62 He campaigned against the Callaeci and Lusitani and seized the Callaeci capital in northwestern Spain bringing Roman troops to the Atlantic and seizing enough plunder to pay his debts.63 Claiming to have completed the peninsulas conquest he made for home after having been hailed imperator.64 When he arrived home in the summer of 60 BC he was then forced to choose between a triumph and election to the consulship either he could remain outside the pomerium Romes sacred boundary awaiting a triumph or cross the boundary giving up his command and triumph to make a declaration of consular candidacy.65 Attempts to waive the requirement for the declaration to be made in person were filibustered in the Senate by Caesars enemy Cato even though the Senate seemed to support the exception.66 Faced with the choice between a triumph and the consulship Caesar chose the consulship.67 First consulship and the Gallic wars Main articles Military campaigns of Julius Caesar and First Triumvirate A denarius depicting Julius Caesar dated to FebruaryMarch 44 BC  the goddess Venus is shown on the reverse holding Victoria and a scepter. Caption CAESAR IMP. M.  L. AEMILIVS BVCA. Caesar stood for the consulship of 59 BC along with two other candidates. His political position at the time was strong he had supporters among the families which had supported Marius or Cinna his connection with the Sullan aristocracy was good his support of Pompey had won him support in turn. His support for reconciliation in continuing aftershocks of the civil war was popular in all parts of society.68 With the support of Crassus who supported Caesars joint ticket with one Lucius Lucceius Caesar won. Lucceius however did not and the voters returned Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus instead one of Caesars longstanding personal and political enemies.6970 First consulship Further information First Triumvirate After the elections Caesar reconciled Pompey and Crassus two political foes in a threeway alliance misleadingly71 termed the First Triumvirate in modern times.72 Caesar was still at work in December of 60 BC attempting to find allies for his consulship and the alliance was finalised only some time around its start.73 Pompey and Crassus joined in pursuit of two respective goals the ratification of Pompeys eastern settlement and the bailing out of tax farmers in Asia many of whom were Crassus clients. All three sought the extended patronage of land grants with Pompey especially seeking the promised land grants for his veterans.74 Caesars first act was to publish the minutes of the Senate and the assemblies signalling the Senates accountability to the public. He then brought in the Senate a bill  crafted to avoid objections to previous land reform proposals and any indications of radicalism  to purchase property from willing sellers to distribute to Pompeys veterans and the urban poor. It would be administered by a board of twenty with Caesar excluded and financed by Pompeys plunder and territorial gains.75 Referring it to the Senate in hope that it would take up the matter to show its beneficence for the people76 there was little opposition and the obstructionism that occurred was largely unprincipled firmly opposing it not on grounds of public interest but rather opposition to Caesars political advancement.75 Unable to overcome Catos filibustering he moved the bill before the people and at a public meeting Caesars coconsul Bibulus threatened a permanent veto for the entire year. This clearly violated the peoples wellestablished legislative sovereignty77 and triggered a riot in which Bibulus fasces were broken symbolising popular rejection of his magistracy.78 The bill was then voted through. Bibulus attempted to induce the Senate to nullify it on grounds it was passed by violence and contrary to the auspices but the Senate refused.79 Caesar also brought and passed a onethird writedown of tax farmers arrears for Crassus and ratification of Pompeys eastern settlements. Both bills were passed with little or no debate in the Senate.80 Caesar then moved to extend his agrarian bill to Campania some time in May this may be when Bibulus withdrew to his house.81 Pompey shortly thereafter also wed Caesars daughter Julia to seal their alliance.82 An ally of Caesars plebeian tribune Publius Vatinius moved the lex Vatinia assigning the provinces of Illyricum and Cisalpine Gaul to Caesar for five years.8384 Suetonius claim that the Senate had assigned to Caesar the silvae callesque woods and tracks is likely an exaggeration fear of Gallic invasion had grown in 60 BC and it is more likely that the consuls had been assigned to Italy a defensive posture that Caesarian partisans dismissed as mere forest tracks.85 The Senate was also persuaded to assign to Caesar Transalpine Gaul as well subject to annual renewal most likely to control his ability to make war on the far side of the Alps.86 Some time in the year perhaps after the passing of the bill distributing the Campanian land87 and after these political defeats Bibulus withdrew to his house. There he issued edicts in absentia purporting unprecedentedly to cancel all days on which Caesar or his allies could hold votes for religious reasons.88 Cato too attempted symbolic gestures against Caesar which allowed him and his allies to feign victimisation these tactics were successful in building revulsion to Caesar and his allies through the year.8990 This opposition caused serious political difficulties to Caesar and his allies belying the common depiction of triumviral political supremacy.91 Later in the year however Caesar  with the support of his opponents  brought and passed the lex Julia de repetundis to crack down on provincial corruption.92 When his consulship ended Caesars legislation was challenged by two of the new praetors but discussion in the Senate stalled and was regardless dropped. He stayed near the city until some time around midMarch.93 Campaigns in Gaul Main article Gallic Wars The extent of the Roman Republic in 40 BC after Caesars conquests During the Gallic Wars Caesar wrote his Commentaries thereon which were acknowledged even in his time as a Latin literary masterwork. Meant to document Caesars campaigns in his own words and maintain support in Rome for his military operations and career he produced some ten volumes covering operations in Gaul from 58 to 52 BC.94 Each was likely produced in the year following the events described and was likely aimed at the general or at least literate population in Rome95 the account is naturally partial to Caesar  his defeats are excused and victories highlighted  but it is almost the sole source for events in Gaul in this period.96 Gaul in 58 BC was in the midst of some instability. Tribes had raided into Transalpine Gaul and there was an ongoing struggle between two tribes in central Gaul which collaterally involved Roman alliances and politics. The divisions within the Gauls  they were no unified bloc  would be exploited in the coming years.97 The first engagement was in April 58 BC when Caesar prevented the migrating Helvetii from moving through Roman territory allegedly because he feared they would unseat a Roman ally.98 Building a wall he stopped their movement near Geneva and  after raising two legions  defeated them at the Battle of Bibracte before forcing them to return to their original homes.99 He was drawn further north responding to requests from Gallic tribes including the Aedui for aid against Ariovistus  king of the Suebi and a declared friend of Rome by the Senate during Caesars own consulship  and he defeated them at the Battle of Vosges.100 Wintering in northeastern Gaul near the Belgae in the winter of 5857 Caesars forward military position triggered an uprising to remove his troops able to eke out a victory at the Battle of the Sabis Caesar spent much of 56 BC suppressing the Belgae and dispersing his troops to campaign across much of Gaul including against the Veneti in what is now Brittany.101 At this point almost all of Gaul  except its central regions  fell under Roman subjugation.102 Vercingetorix throws down his arms at the feet of Julius Caesar painting by Lionel Royer in 1899. Muse Crozatier Le PuyenVelay France. Seeking to buttress his military reputation he engaged Germans attempting to cross the Rhine which marked it as a Roman frontier102 displaying Roman engineering prowess he here built a bridge across the Rhine in a feat of engineering meant to show Romes ability to project power.103 Ostensibly seeking to interdict British aid to his Gallic enemies he led expeditions into southern Britain in 55 and 54 BC perhaps seeking further conquests or otherwise wanting to impress readers in Rome Britain at the time was to the Romans an island of mystery and a land of wonder.104 He however withdrew from the island in the face of winter uprisings in Gaul led by the Eburones and Belgae starting in late 54 BC which ambushed and virtually annihilated a legion and five cohorts.105 Caesar was however able to lure the rebels into unfavourable terrain and routed them in battle.106 The next year a greater challenge emerged with the uprising of most of central Gaul led by Vercingetorix of the Averni. Caesar was initially defeated at Gergovia before besieging Vercingetorix at Alesia. After becoming himself besieged Caesar won a major victory which forced Vercingetorixs surrender Caesar then spent much of his time into 51 BC suppressing any remaining resistance.107 Politics Gaul and Rome In the initial years from the end of Caesars consulship in 59 BC the three socalled triumvirs sought to maintain the goodwill of the extremely popular Publius Clodius Pulcher108 who was plebeian tribune in 58 BC and in that year successfully sent Cicero into exile. When Clodius took an antiPompeian stance later that year he unsettled Pompeys eastern arrangements started attacking the validity of Caesars consular legislation and by August 58 forced Pompey into seclusion. Caesar and Pompey responded by successfully backing the election of magistrates to recall Cicero from exile on the condition that Cicero would refrain from criticism or obstruction of the allies.109110111 Politics in Rome fell into violent street clashes between Clodius and two tribunes who were friends of Cicero. With Cicero now supporting the Caesar and Pompey Caesar sent news of Gaul to Rome and claimed total victory and pacification. The Senate at Ciceros motion voted him an unprecedented fifteen days of thanksgiving.112 Such reports were necessary for Caesar especially in light of senatorial opponents to prevent the Senate from reassigning his command in Transalpine Gaul even if his position in Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum was guaranteed by the lex Vatinia until 54 BC.113 His success was evidently recognised when the Senate voted state funds for some of Caesars legions which until this time Caesar had paid for personally.114 The three allies relations broke down in 57 BC one of Pompeys allies challenged Caesars land reform bill and the allies had a poor showing in the elections that year.115 With a real threat to Caesars command and acta brewing in 56 BC under the aegis of the unfriendly consuls Caesar needed his allies political support.116 Pompey and Crassus too wanted military commands. Their combined interests led to a renewal of the alliance drawing in the support of Appius Claudius Pulcher and his younger brother Clodius for the consulship of 54 BC they planned second consulships with following governorships in 55 BC for both Pompey and Crassus. Caesar for his part would receive a fiveyear extension of command.117 Cicero was induced to oppose reassignment of Caesars provinces and to defend a number of the allies clients his gloomy predictions of a triumviral set of consulsdesignate for years on end proved an exaggeration when only by desperate tactics bribery intimidation and violence were Pompey and Crassus elected consuls for 55 BC.118 During their consulship Pompey and Crassus passed  with some tribunician support  the lex Pompeia Licinia extending Caesars command and the lex Trebonia giving them respective commands in Spain and Syria119 though Pompey never left for the province and remained politically active at Rome.120 The opposition again unified against their heavyhanded political tactics  though not against Caesars activities in Gaul121  and defeated the allies in the elections of that year.122 The ambush and destruction in Gaul of a legion and five cohorts in the winter of 5554 BC produced substantial concern in Rome about Caesars command and competence evidenced by the highly defensive narrative in Caesars Commentaries.123 The death of Caesars daughter and Pompeys wife Julia in childbirth c.late August 54 did not create a rift between Caesar and Pompey.124125126 At the start of 53 BC Caesar sought and received reinforcements by recruitment and a private deal with Pompey before two years of largely unsuccessful campaigning against Gallic insurgents.127 In the same year Crassuss campaign ended in disaster at the Battle of Carrhae culminating in his death at the hands of the Parthians. When in 52 BC Pompey started the year with a sole consulship to restore order to the city128 Caesar was in Gaul suppressing insurgencies after news of his victory at Alesia with the support of Pompey he received twenty days of thanksgiving and pursuant to the Law of the Ten Tribunes the right to stand for the consulship in absentia.129130 Civil war Main article Caesars Civil War Further information Alexandrine war Early life of Cleopatra VII and Reign of Cleopatra VII A Roman bust of Pompey the Great made during the reign of Augustus 27 BC  14 AD a copy of an original bust from 70 to 60 BC Venice National Archaeological Museum Italy From the period 52 to 49 BC trust between Caesar and Pompey disintegrated.131 In 51 BC the consul Marcellus proposed recalling Caesar arguing that his provincia here meaning task in Gaul  due to his victory against Vercingetorix in 52  was complete it evidently was incomplete as Caesar was that year fighting the Bellovaci132 and regardless the proposal was vetoed.133 That year it seemed that the conservatives around Cato in the Senate would seek to enlist Pompey to force Caesar to return from Gaul without honours or a second consulship.134 Cato Bibulus and their allies however were successful in winning Pompey over to take a hard line against Caesars continued command.135 As 50 BC progressed fears of civil war grew both Caesar and his opponents started building up troops in southern Gaul and northern Italy respectively.136 In the autumn Cicero and others sought disarmament by both Caesar and Pompey and on 1 December 50 BC this was formally proposed in the Senate.137 It received overwhelming support  370 to 22  but was not passed when one of the consuls dissolved the meeting.138 That year when a rumour came to Rome that Caesar was marching into Italy both consuls instructed Pompey to defend Italy a charge he accepted as a last resort.139 At the start of 49 BC Caesars renewed offer that he and Pompey disarm was read to the Senate and was rejected by the hardliners.140 A later compromise given privately to Pompey was also rejected at their insistence.141 On 7 January his supportive tribunes were driven from Rome the Senate then declared Caesar an enemy and it issued its senatus consultum ultimum.142 There is scholarly disagreement as to the specific reasons why Caesar marched on Rome. A very popular theory is that Caesar was forced to choose  when denied the immunity of his proconsular tenure  between prosecution conviction and exile or civil war in defence of his position.143144 Whether Caesar actually would have been prosecuted and convicted is debated. Some scholars believe the possibility of successful prosecution was extremely unlikely.145146 Caesars main objectives were to secure a second consulship  first mooted in 52 as colleague to Pompeys sole consulship147  and a triumph. He feared that his opponents  then holding both consulships for 50 BC  would reject his candidacy or refuse to ratify an election he won.148 This also was the core of his war justification that Pompey and his allies were planning by force if necessary indicated in the expulsion of the tribunes149 to suppress the liberty of the Roman people to elect Caesar and honour his accomplishments.150 Italy Spain and Greece Around 10 or 11 January 49 BC151152 in response to the Senates final decree153 Caesar crossed the Rubicon  the river defining the northern boundary of Italy  with a single legion the Legio XIII Gemina and ignited civil war. Upon crossing the Rubicon Caesar according to Plutarch and Suetonius is supposed to have quoted the Athenian playwright Menander in Greek let the die be cast.154 Pompey and many senators fled south believing that Caesar was marching quickly for Rome.155 Caesar after capturing communication routes to Rome paused and opened negotiations but they fell apart amid mutual distrust.156 Caesar responded by advancing south seeking to capture Pompey to force a conference.157 Pompey withdrew to Brundisium and was able to escape to Greece abandoning Italy in face of Caesars superior forces and evading Caesars pursuit.158 Caesar stayed near Rome for about two weeks  during his stay his forceful seizure of the treasury over tribunician veto put the lie to his protribunician war justifications  and left Lepidus in charge of Italy while he attacked Pompeys Spanish provinces.159160 He defeated two of Pompeys legates at the Battle of Ilerda before forcing surrender of the third his legates moved into Sicily and into Africa though the African expedition failed.161 Returning to Rome in the autumn Caesar had Lepidus as praetor bring a law appointing Caesar dictator to conduct the elections he along with Publius Servilius Isauricus won the following elections and would serve as consuls for 48 BC.162 Resigning the dictatorship after eleven days163 Caesar then left Italy for Greece to stop Pompeys preparations arriving in force in early 48 BC.164 Caesar besieged Pompey at Dyrrhachium but Pompey was able to break out and force Caesars forces to flee. Following Pompey southeast into Greece and to save one of his legates he engaged and decisively defeated Pompey at Pharsalus on 9 August 48 BC. Pompey then fled for Egypt Cato fled for Africa others like Cicero and Marcus Junius Brutus begged for Caesars pardon.165 Alexandrine war and Asia Minor See also Alexandrine war Cleopatra and Caesar 1866 painting by JeanLon Grme This mid
1 stcenturyBC Roman wall painting in Pompeii is probably a depiction of Cleopatra VII as Venus Genetrix with her son Caesarion as Cupid. Its owner Marcus Fabius Rufus most likely ordered its concealment behind a wall in reaction to the execution of Caesarion on orders of Octavian in 30 BC.166167 Pompey was killed when he arrived in Alexandria the capital of Egypt. Caesar arrived three days later on 2 October 48 BC. Prevented from leaving the city by Etesian winds Caesar decided to arbitrate an Egyptian civil war between the child pharaoh Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Cleopatra his sister wife and coregent queen.168 In late October 48 BC Caesar was appointed in absentia to a yearlong dictatorship169 after news of his victory at Pharsalus arrived to Rome.170 While in Alexandria he started an affair with Cleopatra and withstood a siege by Ptolemy and his other sister Arsinoe until March 47 BC. Reinforced by eastern client allies under Mithridates of Pergamum he then defeated Ptolemy at the Battle of the Nile and installed Cleopatra as ruler.171 Caesar and Cleopatra celebrated the victory with a triumphal procession on the Nile. He stayed in Egypt with Cleopatra until June or July that year though the relevant commentaries attributed to him give no such impression. Some time in late June Cleopatra gave birth to a child by Caesar called Caesarion.172 When Caesar landed at Antioch he learnt that during his time in Egypt the king of what is now Crimea Pharnaces had attempted to seize what had been his fathers kingdom Pontus across the Black Sea in northern Anatolia. His invasion had swept aside Caesars legates and the local client kings but Caesar engaged him at Zela and defeated him immediately leading Caesar to write veni vidi vici I came I saw I conquered downplaying Pompeys previous Pontic victories. He then left quickly for Italy.173 Italy Africa and Spain Caesars absence from Italy put Mark Antony as magister equitum in charge. His rule was unpopular Publius Cornelius Dolabella serving as plebeian tribune in 47 BC agitated for debt relief and after that agitation got out of hand the Senate moved for Antony to restore order. Delayed by a mutiny in southern Italy he returned and suppressed the riots by force killing many and delivering a similar blow to his popularity. Cato had marched to Africa174 and there Metellus Scipio was in charge of the remaining republicans they allied with Juba of Numidia what used to be Pompeys fleet also raided the central Mediterranean islands. Caesars governor in Spain moreover was sufficiently unpopular that the province revolted and switched to the republican side.175 Caesar demoted Antony on his return and pacified the mutineers without violence176 before overseeing the election of the rest of the magistrates for 47 BC  no elections had yet been held  and also for those of 46 BC. Caesar would serve with Lepidus as consul in 46 he borrowed money for the war confiscated and sold the property of his enemies at fair prices and then left for Africa on 25 December 47 BC.177 Caesars landing in Africa was marked with some difficulties establishing a beachhead and logistically. He was defeated by Titus Labienus at Ruspina on 4 January 46 BC and thereafter took a rather cautious approach.178 After inducing some desertions from the republicans Caesar ended up surrounded at Thapsus. His troops attacked prematurely on 6 April 46 BC starting a battle they then won it and massacred the republican forces without quarter. Marching on Utica where Cato commanded Caesar arrived to find that Cato had killed himself rather than receive Caesars clemency.179 Many of the remaining antiCaesarian leaders including Metellus Scipio and Juba also committed suicide shortly thereafter.180 Labienus and two of Pompeys sons however had moved to the Spanish provinces in revolt. Caesar started a process of annexing parts of Numidia and then returned to Italy via Sardinia in June 46 BC.181 Caesar stayed in Italy to celebrate four triumphs in late September supposedly over four foreign enemies Gaul Egypt Pharnaces Asia and Juba Africa. He led Vercingetorix Cleopatras younger sister Arsinoe and Jubas son before his chariot Vercingetorix was executed.181 According to Appian in some of the triumphs Caesar paraded pictures and models of his victories over fellow Romans in the civil wars to popular dismay.182 The soldiers were each given 24000 sesterces a lifetimes worth of pay further games and celebrations were put on for the plebs. Near the end of the year Caesar heard bad news from Spain and with an army left for the peninsula leaving Lepidus in charge as magister equitum.183 At a bloody battle at Munda on 17 March 45 BC Caesar narrowly found victory184 his enemies were treated as rebels and he had them massacred.185 Labienus died on the field. While one of Pompeys sons Sextus escaped the war was effectively over.186 Caesar remained in the province until June before setting out for Rome arriving in October of the same year and celebrated an unseemly triumph over fellow Romans.185 By this point he had started preparations for war on the Parthians to avenge Crassus death at Carrhae in 53 BC with wideranging objectives that would take him into Dacia for three or more years. It was set to start on 18 March 44 BC.187 Dictatorship and assassination The Green Caesar posthumous portrait from the 
1 st century AD now located at the Altes Museum in Berlin Dictatorships and honours Prior to Caesars assumption of the title dictator perpetuo in February 44 BC he had been appointed dictator some four times since his first dictatorship in 49 BC. After occupying Rome he engineered this first appointment largely to hold elections after 11 days he resigned. The other dictatorships lasted for longer periods up to a year and by April 46 BC he was given a new dictatorship annually.188 The task he was assigned revived that of Sullas dictatorship rei publicae constituendae.189 These appointments however were not the source of legal power themselves in the eyes of the literary sources they were instead honours and titles which reflected Caesars dominant position in the state secured not by extraordinary magistracy or legal powers but by personal status as victor over other Romans.190 Through the period after Pharsalus the Senate showered Caesar with honours191 including the title praefectus moribus lit.prefect of morals which historically was associated with the censorial power to revise the Senate rolls. He was also granted power over war and peace192 usurping a power traditionally held by the comitia centuriata.193 These powers attached to Caesar personally.194 Similarly extraordinary were a number of symbolic honours which saw Caesars portrait placed on coins in Rome  the first for a living Roman195196  with special rights to wear royal dress sit atop a golden chair in the Senate and have his statues erected in public temples. The month Quintilis in which he was born was renamed Julius now July.197 These were symbols of divine monarchy and later objects of resentment. The decisions on the normal operation of the state  justice legislation administration and public works  were concentrated into Caesars person without regard for or even notice given to the traditional institutions of the republic.198 Caesars domination over public affairs and his competitive instinct to preclude all others alienated the political class and led eventually to the conspiracy against his life.199 Legislation Caesar as far as is attested in evidence did not intend to restructure Roman society. Ernst Badian writing in the Oxford Classical Dictionary noted that although Caesar did implement a series of reforms they did not touch on the core of the republican system he had no plans for basic social and constitutional reform and that the extraordinary honours heaped upon him... merely grafted him as an illfitting head on to the body of the traditional structure.189 The most important of Caesars reforms was to the calendar which saw the abolition of the traditional republican lunisolar calendar and its replacement with a solar calendar now called the Julian calendar.200 He also increased the number of magistrates and senators from 600 to 900 to better administer the empire and reward his supporters with offices. Colonies also were founded outside Italy  notably on the sites of Carthage and Corinth which had both been destroyed during Romes 
2 nd century BC conquests  to discharge Italys population into the provinces and reduce unrest.201 The royal power of naming patricians was revived to benefit the families of his men202 and the permanent courts jury pools were also altered to remove the tribuni aerarii leaving only the equestrians and senators.203 He also took further administrative actions to stabilise his rule and that of the state.204 Caesar reduced the size of the grain dole from 320000 down to around 150000 by tightening the qualifications special bonuses were offered to families with many children to stall depopulation.205 Plans were drawn for the conduct of a census. Citizenship was extended to a number of communities in Cisalpine Gaul and to Cdiz.206 During the civil wars Caesar had also instituted a novel debt repayment programme no debts would be forgiven but they could be paid in kind remitted rents up to a certain amount and thrown games distributing food.207 Many of his enemies during the civil wars were pardoned  Caesars clemency was exalted in his propaganda and temple works  with the intent to cultivate gratitude and draw a contrast between himself and the vengeful dictatorship of Sulla.208 The building programmes started prior to his expedition to Spain continued with the construction of the Forum of Caesar and the Temple of Venus Genetrix therein. Other public works including an expansion of Ostias port and a canal through the Corinthian Isthmus were also planned.citation needed Very busy with this work the heavyhandedness with which he ignored the Senate magistrates and those who came to visit him also alienated many in Rome.209 The collegia civic associations restored by Clodius in 58 BC were again abolished.205 His actions to reward his supporters saw him allow his subordinates illegal triumphal processions and resign the consulship on the last day of the year so any ally could be elected as suffect consul for a single day.210 Corruption on the part of his partisans was also overlooked to ensure their support provincial cities and client kingdoms were extorted for favours to pay his bills.211 Conspiracy and death See also Assassination of Julius Caesar Denarius 42 BC of Cassius and Lentulus Spinther depicting the crowned head of Liberty and on the reverse a sacrificial jug and lituus212 An 1867 depiction of Caesars death. The Death of Caesar by JeanLon Grme. Attempts in January 44 BC to call Caesar rex lit.king  a title associated with arbitrary oppression against citizens  were shut down by two tribunes before a supportive crowd. Caesar claiming that the two tribunes infringed on his honour by doing so had them deposed from office and ejected from the Senate.213 The incident both undermined Caesars original arguments for pursuing the civil war protecting the tribunes and angered a public which still revered the tribunes as protectors of popular freedom.214 Shortly before 15 February 44 BC he assumed the dictatorship for life putting an end to any hopes that his powers would be merely temporary.215 Transforming his dictatorship even with a decadal appointment into one for life clearly showed to all contemporaries that Caesar had no intention to restore a free republic and that no free republic could be restored so long as he was in power.216 Just days after his assumption of the life dictatorship he publicly rejected a diadem from Antony at celebrations for the Lupercalia. Interpretations of the episode vary he may have been rejecting the diadem publicly only because the crowd was insufficiently supportive he could have done it performatively to signal he was no monarch alternatively Antony could have acted on his own initiative. By this point however rumour was rife that Caesar  already wearing the dress of a monarch  sought a formal crown and the episode did little to reassure.217 The plan to assassinate Caesar had started by the summer of 45 BC. An attempt to recruit Antony was made around that time though he declined and gave Caesar no warning. By February 44 BC there were some sixty conspirators.218 It is clear that by this time the victorious Caesarian coalition from the civil war had broken apart.219 While most of the conspirators were former Pompeians they were joined by a substantial number of Caesarians.220 Among their leaders were Gaius Trebonius consul in 45 Decimus Brutus consul designate for 42 as well as Cassius and Brutus both praetors in 44 BC.221 Trebonius and Decimus had joined Caesar during the war while Brutus and Cassius had joined Pompey other Caesarians involved included Servius Sulpicius Galba Lucius Minucius Basilus Lucius Tullius Cimber and Gaius Servilius Casca.222 Many of the conspirators would have been candidates in the consular elections for 43 to 41 BC223 likely dismayed by Caesars sham elections in early 44 BC that produced advance results for the years 4341 BC. Those electoral results came from the grace of the dictator and not that of the people for the republican elite this was no substitute for actual popular support.224 Nor is it likely that the subordination of the normal magistrates to Caesars masters of horse Latin magistri equitum was appreciated.225 Brutus who claimed descent from the Lucius Junius Brutus who had driven out the kings and the Gaius Servilius Ahala who had freed Rome from incipient tyranny was the main leader of the conspiracy.226 By late autumn 45 BC graffiti227 and some public comments at Rome were condemning Caesar as a tyrant and insinuating the need for a Brutus to remove the dictator. The ancient sources excepting Nicolaus of Damascus are unanimous that this reflected a genuine turn in public opinion against Caesar.228 Popular indignation at Caesar was likely rooted in his debt policies too friendly to lenders use of lethal force to suppress protests for debt relief his reduction in the grain dole his abolition of the collegia restored by Clodius his abolition of the poorest panel of jurors in the permanent courts and his abolition of open elections which deprived the people of their ancient right of decision.229 A popular turn against Caesar is also observed with reports that the two deposed tribunes were writtenin on ballots at Caesars advance consular elections in place of Caesars candidates.230 Whether there was a tradition of tyrannicide at Rome is unclear Cicero wrote in private as if the duty to kill tyrants was already given he however made no public speeches to that effect and there is little evidence that the public accepted the logic of preventive tyrannicide.231 The philosophical tradition of the Platonic Old Academy was also a factor driving Brutus to action due to its emphasis on a duty to free the state from tyranny.232 While some news of the conspiracy did leak out Caesar refused to take precautions and rejected escort by a bodyguard. The date decided upon by the conspirators was 15 March the Ides of March three days before Caesar intended to leave for his Parthian campaign.233 News of his imminent departure forced the conspirators to move up their plans the Senate meeting on the 
15 th would be the last before his departure.234 They had decided that a Senate meeting was the best place to frame the killing as political rejecting the alternatives at games elections or on the road.235 That only the conspirators would be armed at the Senate meeting per Dio also would have been an advantage. The day 15 March was also symbolically important as it was the day on which consuls took office until the mid
2 nd century BC.236 The Ides of March coin minted in 42 BC depicts Marcus Junius Brutus. The reverse depicts daggers and a pileus symbolising their use to win back freedom. Various stories purport that Caesar was on the cusp of not attending or otherwise being warned about the plot.236237 Approached on his golden chair at the foot of the statue of Pompey the conspirators attacked him with daggers. Whether he fell in silence per Suetonius or after reply to Brutus appearance  kai su teknon you too child  is variantly recorded.238 Between twentythree and thirtyfive wounds later the dictatorforlife was dead.239240 Aftermath of the assassination Further information War of Mutina Second Triumvirate and Liberators civil war Marc Antonys Oration at Caesars Funeral by George Edward Robertson late 
19 th or early 
20 th century The assassins seized the Capitoline hill after killing the dictator. They then summoned a public meeting in the Forum where they were coldly received by the population. They were also unable to fully secure the city as Lepidus  Caesars lieutenant in the dictatorship  moved troops from the Tiber Island into the city proper. Antony the consul who escaped the assassination urged an illogical compromise position in the Senate241 Caesar was not declared a tyrant and the conspirators were not punished.242 Caesars funeral was then approved. At the funeral Antony inflamed the public against the assassins which triggered mob violence that lasted for some months before the assassins were forced to flee the capital and Antony then finally acted to suppress it by force.243 In 44 BC there was a sevenday cometary outburst that the Romans believe to represent the deification of Caeser giving it the name Caesars Comet. On the site of his cremation the Temple of Caesar was begun by the triumvirs in 42 BC at the east side of the main square of the Roman Forum. Only its altar now remains.244 The terms of the will were also read to the public it gave a generous donative to the plebs at large and left as principal heir one Gaius Octavius Caesars greatnephew then at Apollonia and adopted him in the will.245 Resumption of the preexisting republic proved impossible as various actors appealed in the aftermath of Caesars death to liberty or to vengeance to mobilise huge armies that led to a series of civil wars.246 The first war was between Antony in 43 BC and the Senate including senators of both Caesarian and Pompeian persuasion which resulted in Octavian  Caesars heir  exploiting the chaos to seize the consulship and join with Antony and Lepidus to form the Second Triumvirate.247 After purging their political enemies in a series of proscriptions248 the triumvirs secured the deification of Caesar  the Senate declared on 1 January 42 BC that Caesar would be placed among the Roman gods249  and marched on the east where a second war saw the triumvirs defeat the tyrannicides in battle250 resulting in a final death of the republican cause and a threeway division of much of the Roman world.251 By 31 BC Caesars heir had taken sole control of the empire ejecting his triumviral rivals after two decades of civil war. Pretending to restore the republic his masked autocracy was acceptable to the warweary Romans and marked the establishment of a new Roman monarchy.252 Personal life Health and physical appearance The Chiaramonti Caesar bust a posthumous portrait in marble 4430 BC Museo PioClementino Vatican Museums Based on remarks by Plutarch253 Caesar is sometimes thought to have suffered from epilepsy. Modern scholarship is sharply divided on the subject and some scholars believe that he was plagued by malaria particularly during the Sullan proscriptions of the 
80 s BC.254 Other scholars contend his epileptic seizures were due to a parasitic infection in the brain by a tapeworm.255256 Caesar had four documented episodes of what may have been complex partial seizures. He may additionally have had absence seizures in his youth. The earliest accounts of these seizures were made by the biographer Suetonius who was born after Caesar died. The claim of epilepsy is countered among some medical historians by a claim of hypoglycemia which can cause epileptoid seizures.257258 A line from Shakespeare has sometimes been taken to mean that he was deaf in one ear Come on my right hand for this ear is deaf.259 No classical source mentions hearing impairment in connection with Caesar. The playwright may have been making metaphorical use of a passage in Plutarch that does not refer to deafness at all but rather to a gesture Alexander of Macedon customarily made. By covering his ear Alexander indicated that he had turned his attention from an accusation in order to hear the defence.260 Francesco M. Galassi and Hutan Ashrafian suggest that Caesars behavioral manifestations  headaches vertigo falls possibly caused by muscle weakness due to nerve damage sensory deficit giddiness and insensibility  and syncopal episodes were the results of cerebrovascular episodes not epilepsy. Pliny the Elder reports in his Natural History that Caesars father and forefather died without apparent cause while putting on their shoes.261 These events can be more readily associated with cardiovascular complications from a stroke episode or lethal heart attack. Caesar possibly had a genetic predisposition for cardiovascular disease.262 Suetonius writing more than a century after Caesars death describes Caesar as tall of stature with a fair complexion shapely limbs a somewhat full face and keen black eyes.263 Name and family The name Gaius Julius Caesar Main article Gaius Julius Caesar name Using the Latin alphabet of the period which lacked the letters J and U Caesars name would be rendered GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR the form CAIVS is also attested using the older Roman representation of G by C. The standard abbreviation was C. IVLIVS CSAR reflecting the older spelling. The letterform  is a ligature of the letters A and E and is often used in Latin inscriptions to save space.citation needed In Classical Latin it was pronounced a.i.s jul.i.s kaesar. In the days of the late Roman Republic many historical writings were done in Greek a language most educated Romans studied. Young wealthy Roman boys were often taught by Greek slaves and sometimes sent to Athens for advanced training as was Caesars principal assassin Brutus. In Greek during Caesars time his family name was written  Kasar reflecting its contemporary pronunciation. Thus his name is pronounced in a similar way to the pronunciation of the German Kaiser kaz or Dutch keizer kizr.citation needed In Vulgar Latin the original diphthong ae first began to be pronounced as a simple long vowel . Then the plosive k before front vowels began due to palatalization to be pronounced as an affricate hence renderings like tesar in Italian and tsezar in German regional pronunciations of Latin as well as the title of Tsar. With the evolution of the Romance languages the affricate ts became a fricative s thus sesar in many regional pronunciations including the French one from which the modern English pronunciation is derived.citation needed Caesars cognomen itself became a title it was promulgated by the Bible which contains the famous verse Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesars and unto God the things that are Gods. The title became from the late first millennium Kaiser in German and through Old Church Slavic csar Tsar or Czar in the Slavic languages. The last Tsar in nominal power was Simeon II of Bulgaria whose reign ended in 1946 but is still alive in 2023. This means that for approximately two thousand years there was at least one head of state bearing his name. As a term for the highest ruler the word Caesar constitutes one of the earliest best attested and most widespread Latin loanwords in the Germanic languages being found in the text corpora of Old High German keisar Old Saxon ksur Old English csere Old Norse keisari Old Dutch keisere and through Greek Gothic kaisar.264 Posterity Main article JulioClaudian family tree JulioClaudian family tree Wives First marriage to Cornelia from 84 BC until her death in 69 BC Second marriage to Pompeia from 67 BC until he divorced her around 61 BC over the Bona Dea scandal Third marriage to Calpurnia from 59 BC until Caesars death Reliefs of Cleopatra and her son by Julius Caesar Caesarion at the Temple of Dendera Roman painting from the House of Giuseppe II Pompeii early

Posthumously adopted Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus his greatnephew by blood grandson of Julia his sister who later became Emperor Augustus. Suspected children Some ancient sources refer to the possibility of the tyrannicide Marcus Junius Brutus being one of Julius Caesars illegitimate children.266 Caesar at the time Brutus was born was 15. Most ancient historians were sceptical of this and on the whole scholars have rejected the possibility that Brutus was the lovechild of Servilia and Caesar on the grounds of chronology.267268269 Grandchildren Grandchild from Julia and Pompey dead at several days unnamed.270 Lovers Cleopatra mother of Caesarion Servilia mother of Brutus Euno queen of Mauretania and wife of Bogudes Rumors of passive homosexuality Roman society viewed the passive role during sexual activity regardless of gender to be a sign of submission or inferiority. Indeed Suetonius says that in Caesars Gallic triumph his soldiers sang that Caesar may have conquered the Gauls but Nicomedes conquered Caesar.271 According to Cicero Bibulus Gaius Memmius and others  mainly Caesars enemies  he had an affair with Nicomedes IV of Bithynia early in his career. The stories were repeated referring to Caesar as the Queen of Bithynia by some Roman politicians as a way to humiliate him. Caesar himself denied the accusations repeatedly throughout his lifetime and according to Cassius Dio even under oath on one occasion.272 This form of slander was popular during this time in the Roman Republic to demean and discredit political opponents. Catullus wrote a poem suggesting that Caesar and his engineer Mamurra were lovers273 but later apologised.274 Mark Antony charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favors. Suetonius described Antonys accusation of an affair with Octavian as political slander. Octavian eventually became the first Roman Emperor as Augustus.275 Literary works Julii Caesaris quae exstant 1678 A 1783 edition of The Gallic Wars During his lifetime Caesar was regarded as one of the best orators and prose authors in Latin  even Cicero spoke highly of Caesars rhetoric and style.276 Only Caesars war commentaries have survived. A few sentences from other works are quoted by other authors. Among his lost works are his funeral oration for his paternal aunt Julia and his Anticato a document attacking Cato in response to Ciceros eulogy. Poems by Julius Caesar are also mentioned in ancient sources.277 Memoirs The Commentarii de Bello Gallico usually known in English as The Gallic Wars seven books each covering one year of his campaigns in Gaul and southern Britain in the 
50 s BC with the eighth book written by Aulus Hirtius on the last two years. The Commentarii de Bello Civili The Civil War events of the Civil War from Caesars perspective until immediately after Pompeys death in Egypt. Other works historically have been attributed to Caesar but their authorship is in doubt De Bello Alexandrino On the Alexandrine War campaign in Alexandria De Bello Africo On the African War campaigns in North Africa and De Bello Hispaniensi On the Hispanic War campaigns in the Iberian Peninsula. These narratives were written and published annually during or just after the actual campaigns as a sort of dispatches from the front. They were important in shaping Caesars public image and enhancing his reputation when he was away from Rome for long periods. They may have been presented as public readings.278 As a model of clear and direct Latin style The Gallic Wars traditionally has been studied by first or secondyear Latin students. Legacy Historiography Flowers placed on the remains of the altar of Caesar in the Roman Forum of Rome Italy The texts written by Caesar an autobiography of the most important events of his public life are the most complete primary source for the reconstruction of his biography. However Caesar wrote those texts with his political career in mind.279 Julius Caesar is also considered one of the first historical figures to fold his message scrolls into a concertina form which made them easier to read.280 The Roman emperor Augustus began a cult of personality of Caesar which described Augustus as Caesars political heir. The modern historiography is influenced by this tradition.281 Many rulers in history became interested in the historiography of Caesar. Napoleon III wrote the scholarly work Histoire de Jules Csar which was not finished. The second volume listed previous rulers interested in the topic. Charles VIII ordered a monk to prepare a translation of the Gallic Wars in 1480. Charles V ordered a topographic study in France to place the Gallic Wars in context which created forty highquality maps of the conflict. The contemporary Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent catalogued the surviving editions of the Commentaries and translated them to Turkish language. Henry IV and Louis XIII of France translated the first two commentaries and the last two respectively Louis XIV retranslated the first one afterwards.282 Politics Main article Caesarism Julius Caesar is seen as the main example of Caesarism a form of political rule led by a charismatic strongman whose rule is based upon a cult of personality whose rationale is the need to rule by force establishing a violent social order and being a regime involving prominence of the military in the government.283 Other people in history such as the French Napoleon Bonaparte and the Italian Benito Mussolini have defined themselves as Caesarists.284285 Bonaparte did not focus only on Caesars military career but also on his relation with the masses a predecessor to populism.286 The word is also used in a pejorative manner by critics of this type of political rule.
