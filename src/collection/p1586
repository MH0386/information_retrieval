20 th Dynasty Menmaatre Ramesses XI also written Ramses and Rameses reigned from 1107 BC to 1078 BC or 1077 BC and was the tenth and final pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt and as such was the last king of the New Kingdom period. He ruled Egypt for at least 29 years although some Egyptologists think he could have ruled for as long as 30. The latter figure would be up to 2 years beyond this kings highest known date of Year 10 of the Whm Mswt era or Year 28 of his reign.3 One scholar Ad Thijs has suggested that Ramesses XI could even have reigned as long as 33 years.4 It is believed that Ramesses ruled into his Year 29 since a graffito records that the general and High Priest of Amun Piankh returned to Thebes from Nubia on III Shemu day 
23 or just 3 days into what would have been the start of Ramesses XIs 
29 th regnal year. Piankh is known to have campaigned in Nubia during Year 28 of Ramesses XIs reign or Year 10 of the Whm Mswt and would have returned home to Egypt in the following year. Backgroundedit Ramesses XI was once thought to be the son of Ramesses X by Queen Tyti who was a Kings Mother Kings Wife and Kings Daughter in her titles.5 However recent scholarly research into certain copies of parts of the Harris papyrus or Papyrus BM EA 100
52 collected by Anthony Harriswhich discusses a harem conspiracy against Ramesses III reveals that Tyti was instead a queen of pharaoh Ramesses III instead.6 Hence Ramesses XIs mother was not Tyti and although he could have been a son of his predecessor this is not established either. Ramesses XI is believed to have married Tentamun the daughter of Nebseny with whom he is assumed to have fathered DuathathorHenuttawythe future wife of the high priest Pinedjem I. Ramesses XI may have had another daughter named Tentamun who became king Smendes future wife in the next dynasty. Sometime during his reign the High Priest of Amun Amenhotep was ousted from office by Pinehesy the Viceroy of Kush who for some time took control of the Thebais. Although this suppression of the High Priest of Amun used to be dated quite early in the reign prior to year 9 of the reign7 recently the communis opinio has changed to the view that it took place only shortly before the start of the Whm Mswt or Renaissance an era which was inaugurated in regnal Year 19 probably to stress the return of normal conditions following the coup of Pinehesy. Accession dateedit Ramesses XI is usually assigned an accession date of III shemu 20 third month of the Summer season day 208 However a later 
20 th Dynasty papyrus fragment from Deir elMedina published in 2023 by the Egyptologist Robert J. Demare refers to a partial date of Year 4 III month of Akhet together with a change to Year 1 IV month of Akhet.9 Although both kings are unnamed the papyrus is strongly suggested by Demare to refer to the reigns of Ramesses X and his successor Ramesses XI. If confirmed this would mean that Ramesses XI actually had his accession date between the IIIrd and IVth month of Akhet rather than III Shemu 20 as is conventionally assumed.10 Demare stresses in his 2023 paper that the sources which support an accession date of III Shemu day 20 for Ramesses XI are hardly conclusive The two key documents quoted are P. Turin Cat. 1888  Cat. 2095 and P. Ashmolean Museum 19
45.9 6 the Adoption Papyrus. The first is a journal text from the reign of Ramesses XI containing a series of dates spread over several months with only one full date Year 18 IV Smw Day 14 or 
24.1 1 Considering this as certain indication of a recent year change is speculation and beyond proof. The second document is the famous Adoption Papyrus P. Ashmolean Museum 19
45.9 6. In the words of its first editor Alan Gardiner the opening lines of this document record on III Smw Day 20 a visit by Ramesses XI to the Temple of Karnak to announce his accession to the god Amun followed by an offering to this deity.12 The text clearly only speaks of informing the god Amun of the accession of the king  sr.t xa n nTr pn Sps n Imn.13 Contrary to the opinion of the scholars who first posited III Smw Day 20 as the coronation date the accession of the king did not take place on that day at Karnak. This ceremony certainly had already taken place earlier either in the Royal Delta residence or at Memphis and as usual the king later had to pay visits to other state gods to inform them of his accession.14 The whmmswt eraedit Mold with the name of Ramesses XI or IX at LACMA Ramesses XIs reign is notable for a large number of important papyri that have been discovered including the Adoption Papyrus which mentions regnal years 1 and 18 of his reign Pap. B.M. 10052 Pap. Mayer A Pap. B.M. 10403 and Pap. B.M. 10383 the last four containing the accounts of tombrobbery trials conducted during the first two years of the Whm Mswt Pap. Ambras containing a list of documents which were repurchased in year 6 of the Whm Mswt after having been stolen from some temple archive most probably during the chaotic period of the suppression of the High Priest of Amun Amenhotep15 the Turin Taxation Papyrus of an unspecified year 12 Pap. B.M. 10068 which includes on its verso two lists called the Houselist from an unspecified year 12 and the Srmtlist undated but slightly later than the Houselist16 Pap. B.M. 9997 of an unspecified year 14 and 15 and an entire series of Late Ramesside Letters written by among others the scribes of the Necropolis Dhutmose Butehamun and the High Priest Piankh. Late Ramesside Letter no. 9 establishes that the Whm Mswt period lasted into a 
10 th year which more or less equates year 28 proper of Ramesses XI.17 Pinehesy was subsequently designated as an enemy in several papyri from year 1 and 2 of the whmmswt equalling year 19 and 20 proper of Ramesses XI where his name was consistently associated by the nDs or bad bird as its determinative in these papyri.18 How exactly the anarchic period of the Suppression was ended and who ultimately forced Pinehesy out of Thebes is unknown due to a lack of explicit sources. However it seems that Pinehesy retreated to Nubia and succeeded in maintaining some sort of powerbase there for over a decade. In year 10 of the whmmswt the then general and High Priest Piankh goes on an expedition to Nubia to meet Pinehesy. Although it is often postulated that it was the aim of this campaign to fight the former Viceroy19 this is by no means certain. The sources are actually ambiguous on this point and the political climate may well have changed over the years. There is some evidence that at this time Piankh may no longer have been a loyal servant of Ramesses XI which allows for the possibility that he was secretly negotiating with Pinehesy2021 possibly even plotting against the reigning king. E. Wente wrote One has the impression that the viceroy and his Nubian troops were loyalists for the remarks made by his opponent Piankh in letter No. 301 are quite disparaging of the pharaoh Ramesses XI.22 In this letter better known as LRL no. 21 Piankh remarks23 As for Pharaoh l.p.h. how shall he reach this land And of whom is Pharaoh l.p.h. superior still In the same letter and two others LRL no. 34 and no. 35 Piankh gives the order to the Scribe of the Necropolis Tjaroy Dhutmose the lady Nodjmet and a certain Payshuuben to secretly arrest and question two Medjay policemen about certain things they had apparently said24 If they find out that it is true you shall place them in two baskets and they shall be thrown into this water by night. But do not let anybody in the land find out. Whereas Piankh would probably have had the authority to have people executed it is noteworthy that his correspondents are explicitly urged to keep the matter secret. It has been argued that given Piankhs supreme position at the time the secrecy can only have concerned the king.2526 If this is correct it follows that the political situation of the time must have been very complex with Piankh possibly acting on some hidden agenda. Unfortunately due to the very limited nature of the sources the exact relationships between the three main protagonists Piankh Pinehesy and Ramesses XI remain far from clear. Some scholars believe that the Nubian campaign was part of an ongoing power struggle between the High Priest of Amun and the Viceroy of Kush27 However it is equally possible that Piankh came to the rescue of Pinehesy against some common enemy. The verb often translated as to attack Pinehesy only means to meet to go to.28 In fact neither the aim of the expedition nor its outcome are beyond doubt. The issue is further complicated by the ongoing debate about 1 the order of High Priests either Herihor before Piankh or Piankh before Herihor29 and 2 the correct ascription either to the preRenaissance period or to the whmmswt itself of several documents from the reign of Ramesses XI.30 At present Thijs suggestion that Pinehesy was apparently rehabilitated by Ramesses XI in year 11 or 12 of the whmmswt has only been explicitly accepted by the Egyptologist A. Dodson.31 Length of reignedit Neither the length of the Renaissance nor the ascription of certain documents from the reign of Ramesses XI are beyond dispute. At present Thijs proposal that Papyrus BM 10054 dates to the WhmMswt has been confirmed by other scholars such as Von Beckerath and Annie Gassethe latter in a JEA 87 2001 paper which studied several newly discovered fragments belonging to this document.32 Consequently it would appear that Ramesses XIs highest undisputed date is presently Year 11 of the WhmMswt or Year 29 proper of his reign when Piankhs Nubian campaign terminated which means that the pharaoh had a minimum reign of 29 years when he diedwhich can perhaps be extended to 30 years due to the gap between the beginning of Dynasty 21 and the reign of Ramesses XI.33 with 33 years being hypothetical. Krauss and Warburton specifically write that due to the existence of this time gap Egyptologists generally concede that his reign could have ended 1 or 2 years later than year 10 of the wehem mesut era  regnal year 
28.3 4 Aidan Dodson however allows for a year 15 of the WhmMswt on the basis of P. BM 99
97.3 5 Either during the reign of Ramesses XI or shortly afterwards the village of Deir El Medina was abandoned apparently because the Royal Necropolis was shifted northward to Tanis and there was no further need for their services at Thebes. Late New Kingdom chronology of Ramesses XIedit The conventional Egyptian chronology view is that Ramesses XI had an independent reign of between 29 and 30 or 33 full years between Ramesses X and Smendes before dying. Shortly before his death he transferred Egypts political capital to Tanis where he died and was buried by Smendes who succeeded him but only ruled Lower Egypt while Herihor ruled Upper Egypt as the High Priest of Egypt at Thebes. Thijs separate proposal that the first 17 years of Ramesses XIs reign were entirely contemporary with the reigns of Ramesses IX Years 519 and Ramesses X Years 1336 is not currently accepted by most Egyptologists except Aidan Dodson in his 2012 book Afterglow of Empire.37 Burialedit Sometime during this troubled period Ramesses XI died under unknown circumstances. While he had a tomb prepared for himself in the Valley of the Kings KV4 it was left unfinished and only partly decorated since Ramesses XI instead arranged to have himself buried away from Thebes possibly near Memphis. This pharaohs tomb however includes some unusual features including four rectangular rather than square pillars in its burial chamber and an extremely deep central burial shaft at over 30 feet or 10 metres long which was perhaps designed as an additional security device to prevent tomb robbery.38 During the 
21 st dynasty under the reign of the High Priest of Thebes Pinedjem I39 Ramesses XIs tomb was used as a workshop for processing funerary materials from the burials of Hatshepsut Thutmose III and perhaps Thutmose I. Ramesses XIs tomb has stood open since antiquity and was used as a dwelling by the Copts.40 Since Ramesses XI had himself buried in Lower Egypt Smendes rose to the kingship of Egypt based on the well known custom that he who buried the king inherited the throne. Since Smendes buried Ramesses XI he could legally assume the crown of Egypt and inaugurate the 
21 st Dynasty from his hometown at Tanis even if he did not control Middle and Upper Egypt which were now effectively in the hands of the High Priests of Amun at Thebes.
