Father possibly Djedkare Isesi Mother possibly Setibhor Burial Pyramid of Unas Dynasty Fifth Dynasty Unas juns or Wenis also spelled Unis Ancient Egyptian wnjs hellenized form Oenas ins or Onnos was a pharaoh the ninth and last ruler of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt during the Old Kingdom. Unas reigned for 15 to 30 years in the mid
24 th century BC circa 23452315 BC succeeding Djedkare Isesi who might have been his father. Little is known of Unas activities during his reign which was a time of economic decline. Egypt maintained trade relations with the Levantine coast and Nubia and military action may have taken place in southern Canaan. The growth and decentralization of the administration in conjunction with the lessening of the kings power continued under Unas ultimately contributing to the collapse of the Old Kingdom some 200 years later. Unas built a pyramid in Saqqara the smallest of the royal pyramids completed during the Old Kingdom. The accompanying mortuary complex with its high and valley temples linked by a 7
50 metrelong 2460 ft causeway was lavishly decorated with painted reliefs whose quality and variety surpass the usual royal iconography.6 Furthermore Unas was the first pharaoh to have the Pyramid Texts carved and painted on the walls of the chambers of his pyramid a major innovation that was followed by his successors until the First Intermediate Period c.2160  c.2050 BC. These texts identify the king with Ra and with Osiris whose cult was on the rise in Unas time and were meant to help the king reach the afterlife. Unas had several daughters and possibly one or two sons who are believed to have predeceased him. Manetho a thirdcentury BC Egyptian priest of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and author of the first history of Egypt claims that with Unas death the Fifth Dynasty came to an end. Unas was succeeded by Teti the first pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty possibly after a short crisis. However the archaeological evidence suggests that the Egyptians at the time made no conscious break with the preceding dynasty and the distinction between the Fifth and Sixth dynasties might be illusory. The funerary cult of Unas established at his death continued until the end of the Old Kingdom and may have survived during the chaotic First Intermediate Period. The cult was still in existence or revived during the later Middle Kingdom c. 2050  c. 1650 BC. This did not prevent Amenemhat I and Senusret I c. 1990  c. 1930 BC from partially dismantling the mortuary complex of Unas for its materials. In parallel to the official cult Unas may have received popular veneration as a local god of Saqqara until as late as the Late Period 664332 BC nearly 2000 years after his death. Attestationsedit Historical sourcesedit Unas is well attested by historical sources with three ancient Egyptian king lists dating to the New Kingdom period mentioning him.18 He occupies the 
33 rd entry of the Abydos King List which was written during the reign of Seti I 12901279 BC. Unas name is also present on the Saqqara Tablet 
32 nd entry19 and on the Turin canon third column 
25 th row both of which were written during the reign of Ramses II 12791213 BC.18 The Turin canon further credits Unas with 30 years of reign.1820 These sources all place Unas as the ninth and final ruler of the Fifth Dynasty succeeding Djedkare Isesi and preceding Teti on the throne.21 This relative chronology is corroborated by archaeological evidence for example in the tomb of officials serving under these kings.22 In addition to these sources Unas was also likely mentioned in the Aegyptiaca a history of Egypt written in the 
3 rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II 283246 BC by the Egyptian priest Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is known to us only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. Africanus relates that the Aegyptiaca mentioned a pharaoh Onnos reigning for 33 years at the end of the Fifth Dynasty. Onnos is believed to be the hellenized form for Unas and Africanus 
33 year figure fits well with the 30 years of reign given to Unas on the Turin canon.18 Contemporaneous sourcesedit Alabaster globular vase of Unas Louvre23 The primary contemporaneous sources attesting to Unas activities are the many reliefs from his pyramid complex. Excluding these surprisingly few documents dating to Unas reign have survived to this day considering the 
30 year length that later records give for his reign. Excavations at Abusir the royal necropolis of the Fifth Dynasty have produced only four dated inscriptions safely attributable to Unas. They explicitly mention his third fourth sixth and eighth years on the throne.24 Unas also left a rock inscription on the island of Elephantine next to the First Cataract of the Nile in Nubia.25 In addition several alabaster vases bearing Unas cartouche are known. A complete vessel and additional fragments originating from Byblos14 on the Levantine coast are now in the National Museum of Beirut.26 A vase of unknown provenance is located in the National Archaeological Museum of Florence and reads Horus Wadjtawy living eternally king of Upper and Lower Egypt son of Ra Unas living eternally.27

31 c Reignedit Familyedit Unas assumed the throne at the death of his predecessor Djedkare Isesi. Djedkare is thought to have been Unas father2 in spite of the complete lack of evidence bearing on the question.33 The succession from Djedkare Isesi to Unas seems to have been smooth.34 Unas had at least two queens Nebet35 and Khenut36 who were buried in a large double mastaba adjacent to their husbands pyramid. Unas and Nebet possibly had a son the kings son royal chamberlain priest of Maat and overseer of Upper Egypt UnasAnkh37 who died about 10 years into Unas reign.38 The filiation of UnasAnkh is indirectly hinted at by his name and titles and by the presence of his tomb near those of Nebet and Unas39 but is not universally accepted.40
41 d Two other sons have been proposed Nebkauhor43 and Shepsespuptah44 but these filiations are conjectural and contested.45 Unas likely died without a male heir.45 Unas had at least five daughters named Hemetre Hemi46 Khentkaues47 Neferut48 Nefertkaues Iku49 and Sesheshet Idut.50 The status of another possible daughter Iput is uncertain.51 Durationedit Relief of Sahure wearing the tunic of the Sed festival52 similar to the relief depicting Unas Sed festival from his mortuary complex53 The duration of Unas reign is uncertain. As indicated above historical sources credit him with 30 and 33 years on the throne figures that have been adopted by many Egyptologists including Flinders Petrie54 William C. Hayes55 Darrell Baker14 Peter Munro56 and Jaromir Malek.6 In favor of such a long reign are scenes57 of a Sed festival found in Unas mortuary temple.582 This festival was normally celebrated only after 30 years of reign and was meant to rejuvenate the pharaohs strength and power. Mere depictions of the festival do not necessarily imply a long reign however. For example a relief showing pharaoh Sahure in the tunic of the Sed festival has been found in his mortuary temple5259 although both historical sources and archeological evidence agree that he ruled Egypt for less than 14 full years.601011 Other Egyptologists suspect a reign of less than 30 years for Unas owing to the scarcity of artefacts datable to his reign as well as the lack of documents dated to beyond his eighth year on the throne.61 Hence Jrgen von Beckerath believes that Unas ruled Egypt for 20 years10 while Rolf Krauss David Warburton and Erik Hornung shortened this number to 15 years in their 2012 study of Egyptian chronology.11 Krauss and Miroslav Verner further question the credibility of the Turin Canon concerning the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties so that the 
30 year figure credited to Unas by the canon might not be reliable.62 Excavations63 of the tomb of NikauIsesi under the direction of Naguib Kanawati at Saqqara have yielded evidence in support of a shorter reign.64 NikauIsesi was an official who started his career during the reign of Djedkare Isesi. He lived through that of Unas and died as overseer of UpperEgypt under Unas successor Teti.22 NikauIsesi is known to have died on the year of the eleventh cattle count during Tetis reign an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom and every year during the later Middle Kingdom c.2055  c.1650 BC.22 Thus NikauIsesi would have lived for 22 years after Teti took the throne and together with the 30 years of reign credited to Unas would have died past 70 years old.22 However forensic examination of his mummy yielded an age at death of no more than 45 years old. This suggests that the cattle count occurred more than once every two years during Unas and Tetis time possibly irregularly. If so Unas 
30 year figure on the Turin canon understood to mean 15 cattle counts could translate into as little as 15 years which together with just 11 years during Tetis reign would account for NikauIsesis death at around 40 to 45 years of age.22 Activitiesedit Drawing54 of the rock inscription of Unas on Elephantinee Trade and warfare Owing to the scarcity of evidence dating to Unas reign we know very little about his activities.14 Existing trade relations with foreign countries and cities in particular Byblos67 seem to have continued during Unas time on the throne. Reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex show two large seagoing ships coming back from an expedition to the Levantine coast with SyroCanaanite men who were either the boat crews or slaves.6869 Another relief depicts a military campaign70 Egyptians armed with bows and daggers attacking Canaanite nomads called the Shasu.71 Similar reliefs have been found in preceding pyramid complexes such as that of Sahure and they may thus be standard themes rather than depictions of actual events.70 Other sources tend to confirm the accuracy of these depictions for example the autobiography of Weni relates many punitive raids against Canaanite nomads in the early Sixth Dynasty.7072 To the South of Egypt inscriptions of Unas on Elephantine record a visit of the king to Lower Nubia possibly to receive tribute from local chieftains58 or because of growing unrest in the region.73 In addition a relief from the causeway of Unas leading to his pyramid shows a giraffe suggesting trade relations with Nubia.74 Domestic Relief showing starving nomads from Unas causeway at Saqqara Unas reign was a time of economic decline73 although as the French Egyptologist Nicolas Grimal writes it was by no means a time of decadence.33 Indeed the Egyptian state was still capable of mounting important expeditions to provide building stones for the kings pyramid complex.2 These expeditions are depicted on unique reliefs found in Unas causeway75762 and are also referred to in the autobiographical stela of an administration official.

34.1 foot palmiformg columns of red granite from Elephantine to Saqqara in only four days a feat for which he was praised by the king.77 In addition to the important construction works undertaken in Saqqara for the construction of his pyramid complex building activities also took place on Elephantine.33 Until 1996 the domestic situation during Unas reign was thought to have been disastrous based on reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex showing emaciated people and thus suggesting times of famine.579 This changed when excavations at Abusir in 1996 yielded similar reliefs in the mortuary complex of Sahure who reigned at a prosperous time in the early Fifth Dynasty.80 In addition research showed that the starving people are likely to be desert dwellers nomads distinguished by their specific hairstyle rather than Egyptians.81 Thus these reliefs are now understood to be standard representations of the generosity of the king towards the destitute and of the hardships of life in the desert regions bordering Egypt82 rather than referring to actual events.81 Death and end of a dynastyedit In his history of Egypt Manetho states that with the death of Unas the Fifth Dynasty came to an end.33 This may be because Unas died without a male heir73 his probable son UnasAnkh having predeceased him. This might have caused a succession crisis73 hinted at by the personal name chosen by Teti upon his accession to the throne Seheteptawy meaning He who reconcilespacifies the two lands.3373 Tetis claim to the throne could have relied on his marriage to Iput who may have been a daughter of Unas.838485 This possibility is heavily debated as the interpretation of Iputs titles that would indicate that she was the daughter of a king is uncertain.h51 Furthermore the idea that Teti could legitimate his claim by marrying into the royal family is rejected by many Egyptologists including Munro Dobrev Baud Mertz Pirenne and Robin who do not think that the right to the pharaonic throne passed through the female line.86 In addition to Manethos statement the Turin king list presents a special break point between Unas and his successor Teti. Although the king list is not organized in dynastieswhich were invented by Manethothe Egyptologist Jaromir Malek explains that the criterion for such divisions in the Turin Canon invariably was the change of location of the capital and royal residence.84 Malek thus suggests that the capital of Egypt then known as InbuHedji was indeed supplanted at the time by settlements located to the South East of South Saqqara where Unas palace may have been located. In the second millennium BC these cities finally merged and gave rise to Memphis.
88 j Whatever the basis for Manethos choice to end the Fifth Dynasty with Unas Egyptians living at the time probably perceived no particular change from one dynasty to the next.33 The administration of the state shows no evidence of disturbances with many officials continuing their careers from Unas onto Tetis reign.33 These include the viziers Mehu Kagemni and NikauIsesi and the overseer of the province of Edfu Isi.89 Given that the Egyptians of the Old Kingdom might not have conceived of dynasties90 the distinction between the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties might be illusory.33 Evolution of religion and kingshipedit The reigns of Djedkare Isesi and of Unas were a time of changes in Ancient Egyptian religion and in the ideology of kingship changes that are first demonstrable under Unas.91 A statistical analysis of clay seal fragments bearing Horus names of pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty points to a marked decline of the cult of the king during Unas time on the throne.92 This continued under Unas successor Teti for whom we know only two seals bearing his Horus name.93 This trend reflects the lessening of the kings power in conjunction with the growth of the administration and priesthood.73 Meanwhile the cult of Osiris was becoming more important94 with this god replacing the king as the guarantor of life after death for the pharaohs subjects.8495 The German Egyptologist Hartwig Altenmller writes that for an Egyptian of the time the ... afterlife no longer depends on the relationship between the individual mortal and the king ... instead it is linked to his ethical position in direct relation to Osiris.95 In contrast the cult of the sun god Ra was in apparent decline96 even though Ra was still the most important deity of the Egyptian pantheon.95 Thus Djedkare Isesi and Unas did not build a sun temple in contrast with most of their Fifth Dynasty predecessors.9497 In addition the names of Menkauhor Kaiu and Unas do not incorporate any reference to Ra in rupture with a tradition which held since the reign of Userkaf about a century earlier. The Pyramid Texts found in Unas pyramid demonstrate the importance of Osiris and Ra in ancient Egyptian religion at the time. Both gods were believed to play the key roles in accessing the afterlife with Ra as the source of life and Osiris as the force through which the next life would be attained.
98 k Pyramid complexedit The pyramid of Unas at Saqqara Main article Pyramid of Unas Unas had a pyramid built for himself in North Saqqara between the pyramid of Sekhemkhet and the southwestern corner of the pyramid complex of Djoser in symmetry with the pyramid of Userkaf located at the northeastern corner.102 In the process workers leveled and covered older tombs located in the area2 most notably the tomb of the Second Dynasty pharaoh Hotepsekhemwy c. 2890 BC.102 The original Egyptian name of the pyramid was Nefer Isut Unas meaning Beautiful are the places of Unas.103 The pyramid of Unas is the smallest102 of the pyramids completed during the Old Kingdom having a square base of 
57.7  m  
57.7  m 189 ft  189 ft for a height of 43 m 141 ft.102103 Mortuary complexedit A restored section of the causeway of Unas The pyramid of Unas is part of a larger mortuary complex built around it. It was approached via an ancient lake104 on the shores of which Unas valley temple was located. This temple received the provisions for the cult of the king and the offerings to be made were prepared there. At the back of the valley temple was the beginning of a 7
50 metre 24
60 foot causeway equaled only by that of Khufu102 and leading to an upper temple adjacent to the pyramid. A thin slit in the roof of the causeway allowed the light to illuminate its walls covered for their entire length in painted reliefs. These depicted the Egyptian seasons processions of people from the nomes of Egypt craftsmen at work offerings bearers battle scenes and the transport of granite columns for the construction of the pyramid complex.105 At the end of the causeway was a large hall leading to a pillared open court surrounded by magazine chambers.105 The court led into the mortuary temple proper which housed statues of the king and where the offerings to the deceased took place.105 This was immediately adjacent to the eastern side of the pyramid which was surrounded by an enclosure wall defining the sacred space. At the southeast corner of the enclosure was a small satellite pyramid for the Ka of the king.102 The internal chambers of the pyramid were entered in 1881 by Gaston Maspero who thus discovered the pyramid texts. The burial chamber housed nothing but a black greywacke1 sarcophagus sunk into the floor and a canopic chest. The sarcophagus proved to contain scattered bones which may belong to Unas.102 Pyramid Textsedit Main article Pyramid Texts The Pyramid Texts inscribed on the walls of Unas burial chamber The main innovation of the pyramid of Unas is the first appearance of the Pyramid Texts6 one of the oldest religious texts in Egypt to have survived to this day.l In doing so Unas initiated a tradition that would be followed in the pyramid of the kings and queens of the Sixth to Eighth Dynasties until the end of the Old Kingdom circa 200 years later.107 In total 283 magical spells1
06 m also known as utterances were carved and the signs painted blue on the walls of the corridor antechamber and burial chamber of Unas pyramid.109 They constitute the most complete rendition of the Pyramid Texts existing today.110 These spells were intended to help the king in overcoming hostile forces and powers in the Underworld and thus join with the sun god Ra his divine father in the afterlife.111 By writing the texts on the walls of the pyramids internal chambers the architects of Unas pyramid ensured that the king would benefit from their potency even if the funerary cult was to cease.2112 Hence the Pyramid Texts of the pyramid of Unas incorporate instructions for ritual actions and words to be spoken suggesting that they were precisely those performed and recited during the cult of the king in his mortuary temple.113 The good preservation of the texts in Unas pyramid shows that they were arranged so as to be read by the Ba of Unas as it arose from the sarcophagus thanks to resurrection utterances and surrounded by protective spells and ritual offerings.110114 The Ba would then leave the burial chamber which incorporates texts identifying the king with Osiris in the Duat and would move to the antechamber symbolizing the Akhet. Included in the spells written on the walls of the antechamber of Unas are two utterances known as the Cannibal Hymn which portrays the pharaoh as flying to heaven through a stormy sky and eating both gods and men. In doing so the king would receive the life force of the gods.1
10 no At this point the Ba of Unas would face east the direction of the sunrise and beyond the pyramid masonry the false door of the mortuary temple where funerary rituals were performed. Finally turning left the Ba would join Ra in the sky by passing through the pyramid corridor.110 An example of a spell from the pyramid of Unas is Utterance 217111 ReAtum this Unas comes to you A spirit indestructible Your son comes to you This Unas comes to you May you cross the sky united in the dark May you rise in lightland the place in which you shine Legacyedit Scarab bearing Unas name117 Unas most immediate legacy is his funerary cult which continued at least until the end of the Old Kingdom. This cult is attested by the tombs at Saqqara of seven priests responsible for the religious duties to be performed in the funerary complex. Three of these tombs date to the early Sixth Dynasty in the time following the death of Pepi I. Three more tombs date to the reign of Pepi II and the last one dates to the very end of the Old Kingdom c. 2180 BC. The priests of the cult of Unas adopted basilophorous names incorporating that of the king possibly upon taking office.118 Unas funerary cult appears to have survived during the chaotic First Intermediate Period until the Middle Kingdom.119 By the time of the 
12 th Dynasty c. 19
90 c. 1800 BC the lectorpriest Unasemsafp and his family were involved in the cult of Unas.120121 In spite of this Unas funerary complex was partially dismantled and its materials reemployed for the construction of Amenemhat I and Senusret I own pyramid complexes.122123 In addition to his official cult Unas was deified and became a local god of the Saqqara necropolis. Grimal attributes this directly to the grandeur of his funerary complex.33 Malek doubts the existence of a popular cult of Unas during the Old Kingdom but acknowledges it from the Middle Kingdom onwards.124 He attributes this Middle Kingdom revival to the geographic position of Unas complex making it a natural gateway to the Saqqara necropolis.125 The popular cult of the deified Unas continued for nearly 2000 years as shown by the numerous scarabs bearing Unas name found in Saqqara and dated from the New Kingdom c.15
50 c.1077 BC until the Late Period 664332 BC.117126127128 The epicenter of this cult was not the pyramid of Unas nor the associated mortuary temple but rather the statues of the king in the valley temple.129 This activity could explain why the pyramid complex of Unas was the object of restoration works under the impulse of Prince Khaemweset a son of Ramesses II 12791213 BC.105 Notesedit  Proposed dates for Unas reign 24042374 BC23 23752345 BC4567 23672347 BC8 23532323 BC9 23422322 BC10 23212306 BC11 23122282 BC.12  Inventory number 32

This style is for example present in the mortuary complex of king Sahure.78  Iput held the title of z

3 tntjr meaning that she was the mother of a king Pepi I51  InbuHedj means White Walls.87  From Mennefer meaning Perfect and enduring the name of the pyramid of Pepi I next to which Mennefer was located.87  Another important religious work the Memphite Theology may have been written during the reign of Unas.73 The Memphite Theology is a story of the creation of the world and of the religious and social order of ancient Egypt through the word and will of the god Ptah. The king himself is described as the personified Horus and an aspect of Ptah.99 It is now widely believed however that this theological text dates to either to the 
19 th Dynasty or to the much later 
25 th Dynasty 760656 BC.100101  Note that the archaic style of certain sections of the Pyramid Texts indicate that these are much older than Unas reign.106  The number reported differs from scholar to scholar. Clayton mentions 228 spells108 Allen gives 2
36.1 07  While most historians believe that it is unlikely that Unas himself engaged in cannibalism the Egyptologist Ernest Alfred Wallis Budge proposed that the Cannibal Hymn may harken back to an earlier time in Egyptian history when cannibalism was in fact practiced.115  This inspired the American technical death metal band Nile which recorded an 11
43 long song titled Unas Slayer of the Gods based on the Cannibal Hymn. It appears on their 2002 album In Their Darkened Shrines.116  Unasemsaf means Unas is his protection. Referencesedit  a b Verner 20
