4 th Dynasty Djedefre also known as Djedefra and Radjedef was an ancient Egyptian king pharaoh of the 
4 th Dynasty during the Old Kingdom. He is well known by the Hellenized form of his name Rhatoiss  by Manetho. Djedefre was the son and immediate throne successor of Khufu the builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza his mother is not known for certain. He is the king who introduced the royal title SaR meaning Son of Ra and the first to connect his cartouche name with the sun god Ra. Familyedit See also Fourth Dynasty of Egypt family tree Statue of Setka inscribed with his name and titles in the Louvre Djedefre married his brother Kawabs widow Hetepheres II who was sister to both of them and who perhaps married a third brother of theirs Khafre after Djedefres death.4 Another queen Khentetenka is known from statue fragments in the Abu Rowash mortuary temple.5 Known children of Djedefre are Hornit Eldest Kings Son of His Body known from a statue depicting him and his wife.6 Baka Eldest Kings Son known from a statue base found in Djedefres mortuary temple depicting him with his wife Hetepheres.7 Setka Eldest Kings Son of His Body Unique Servant of the King known from a scribe statue found in his fathers pyramid complex.8 It is possible that he ruled for a short while after his fathers death an unfinished pyramid at Zawiyet elArian was started for a ruler whose name ends in ka this could have been Setka or Baka.4 Neferhetepes Kings Daughter of His Body Gods Wife is known from a statue fragment from Abu Rowash. Until recently she was believed to be the mother of a pharaoh of the next dynasty either Userkaf or Sahure.8 The French excavation team led by Michel Valloggia fr found the names of two other possible children of Djedefre in the pyramid complex Nikaudjedefre Kings Son of His Body was buried in Tomb F15 in Abu Rowash it is possible that he wasnt a son of Djedefre but lived later and his title was only honorary.8 Hetepheres Kings Daughter of His Body was mentioned on a statue fragment.6 Reignedit Cartouche name of Djedefre in the AbydosList  name shows honorific transposition being written in the order RaDjedEf Red granite head of Djedefre in the Louvre Quartzite feet of a statue of Djedefre in the Louvre. The statue fragment also includes his Horus name Kheper alongside a cartouche of his name. The Turin King List credits him with a rule of eight years but the highest known year referred to during this reign appears to be the year of his 
11 th cattle count. The anonymous year of the 
11 th count date presumably of Djedefre was found written on the underside of one of the massive roofingblock beams which covered Khufus southern boatpits by Egyptian work crews.9 Miroslav Verner notes that in the work crews mason marks and inscriptions either Djedefras throne name or his Golden Horus name occur exclusively.10 Verner writes that the current academic opinion regarding the attribution of this date to Djedefre is disputed among Egyptologists Rainer Stadelmann Vassil Dobrev fr Peter Jnosi de favour dating it to Djedefre whereas Wolfgang Helck Anthony Spalinger de Jean Vercoutter and W.S. Smith attribute this date to Khufu instead on the assumption that the ceiling block with the date had been brought to the building site of the boat pit already in Khufus time and placed in position only as late as during the burial of the funerary boat in Djedefres time.10 The German scholar Dieter Arnold in a 1981 MDAIK paper noted that the marks and inscriptions of the blocks from Khufus boat pit seem to form a coherent collection relating to the different stages of the same building project realised by Djedefres crews.11 Verner stresses that such marks and inscriptions usually pertained to the breaking of the blocks in the quarry their transportation their storage and manipulation in the building site itself12 In this context the attribution of just a single inscriptionand what is more the only one with a dateon all the blocks from the boat pit to somebody other than Djedefra does not seem very plausible.13 Verner also notes that the FrenchSwiss team excavating Djedefres pyramid have discovered that this kings pyramid was really finished in his reign. According to Vallogia Djedefres pyramid largely made use of a natural rock promontory which represented circa 45 of its core the side of the pyramid was 200 cubits long and its height was 125 cubits.14 The original volume of the monument of Djedefre hence approximately equalled that of Menkauras own pyramid.15 Therefore the argument that Djedefre enjoyed a short reign because his pyramid was unfinished is somewhat discredited.16 This means that Djedefre likely ruled Egypt for a minimum of 11 years if the cattle count was annual or 22 years if it was biennial Verner himself supports the shorter 
11 year figure and notes that the relatively few monuments and records left by Djedefra do not seem to favour a very long reign for this king.16 Pyramid complexedit The ruined pyramid of Djedefre at Abu Rawash Djedefre continued the move north in the location of pyramids by building his now ruined pyramid at Abu Rawash some 8 kilometres 
5.0  mi to the north of Giza. It is the northernmost part of the Memphite necropolis. While Egyptologists previously assumed that his pyramid at this heavily denuded site was unfinished upon his death more recent excavations from 1995 to 2005 have established that it was indeed completed.17 The most recent evidence indicates that its current state is the result of extensive plundering in later periods while the kings statues were smashed as late as the 
2 nd century AD.17 During the Roman period ca. 2000 years ago Djedefres pyramid was quarried for its stone and as such there is little left standing today. The 
20 th century has also not been kind to this monument  during the last century it was used as a military camp and its proximity to Cairo exposed it to modern development.18 Some believe that the sphinx of his wife Hetepheres II which was part of Djedefres pyramid complex was the first sphinx created. In 2004 evidence that Djedefre was responsible for the building of the Sphinx at Giza in the image of his father was reported by the French Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev.3 Due to the poor condition of Abu Rawash only small traces of his mortuary complex have been found. Only the rough ground plan of his mud brick mortuary temple was able to be tracedwith some difficultyin the usual place on the east face of the pyramid.19 His pyramid causeway proved to run from north to south rather than the more conventional east to west while no valley temple has been found.19 Referencesedit  Kim Ryholt The political Situation in Egypt during the second intermediate Period c. 1800  1550 B.C.
