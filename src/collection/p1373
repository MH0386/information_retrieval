18 th Dynasty of Egypt Mutnofret in hieroglyphs Era New Kingdom 15501069 BC Mutnofret Mut is Beautiful also rendered as Mutneferet or Mutnefert was a queen during the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. She was a secondary wife of Thutmose I and the mother of his successor Thutmose II Thutmose Is chief wife however was his sister Queen Ahmose the mother of Hatshepsut.1 Based on her title of Kings Daughter2 she is likely to have been a daughter of Ahmose I and a sister of Amenhotep I who married the latters successor Thutmose I.3 It is possible that she was also the mother of Thutmose Is other sons Amenmose and Wadjmose.4 The connection of Thutmose I and Thutmose II to the earlier kings Ahmose and Amenhotep I and also the mother of Wadjmose and Amenmose was conjectured to have been Queen Ahmose in older and sometimes even current literature.5 However the absence of the title Kings Daughter among the titles of Queen Ahmose has been considered decisive in indicating she was not the daughter of an earlier king and owed her primacy to being the sister as indicated by her title Kings Sister of the new king Thutmose I himself the son of nonreigning parents his mother Senisonbe is titled only Kings Mother.6 The admittedly rare attestation of the title Kings Daughter for Mutnofret suggests it was she not Queen Ahmose who connected their husband Thutmose I to his immediate predecessors. Mutnofret was depicted in the Deir elBahri temple built by her grandson Thutmose III on a stela found at the Ramesseum on the colossus of her son and a statue of her bearing a dedication by Thutmose II was found in Wadjmoses chapel.7 This suggests that Mutnofret was still alive during her sons reign.8 Referencesedit  Dodson  Hilton 2004 139 Gauthier 1912 224 226 234.
