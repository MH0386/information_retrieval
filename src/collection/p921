30.9 51 Country Egypt Governorate Kafr El Sheikh Population 2006  Total 14733 Time zone UTC2 EST Sakha also known by the ancient name of Xois Arabic  Koin Greek  Coptic 1 Strabo xvii. p 802 Ptolemy iv. 5.  50  Stephanus of Byzantium s. v. is a town in Kafr El Sheikh Governorate of Egypt. Located near the center of the Nile Delta it is a city of great antiquity identified with the ancient Egyptian city of swwt Khasut or Khaset. Historyedit swwt23 in hieroglyphs Map of ancient Egypt showing Xois Xois sat upon an island formed by the Sebennytic and Phatnitic branches of the Nile. It belonged to the Sebennytic Nome and later was the capital of its own nome the Xoite nome. The Fourteenth Dynasty of Egypt consisted according to Manetho of 76 Xoite kings. This dynasty immediately preceded that of the Hyksos during the Second Intermediate Period. It seems possible therefore that Xois from its strong position among the marshes of the Nile Delta formed by the intersecting branches of the river could have held out during the occupation of the Delta by the Hyksos or at least compromised with the invaders by paying them tribute. This hypothesis however is not shared by most Egyptologists today who believe that the Fourteenth Dynasty was based in Avaris in the eastern Delta.4 By some geographers Xois is supposed to be the Papremis of Herodotus ii. 59 iii. 12. JeanFranois Champollion lEgypte sous les Pharaons vol. ii. p. 214 identified Xoiss remains at modernday Sakha Sakkra which is the Arabic version of the Coptic Seow and Egyptian sw Niebuhr Travels vol. i. p. 75. The road from Tamiathis to Memphis passed through Xois. Through the Roman and Byzantine era Xois was the center of a Christian diocese. It remains a vacant titular bishopric.5 The diocese remained active through at least the year 7
00.6  In the 9
00 s Ibn Hawqal described Sakha as a large city. At the time of Yaqut alHamawi in the 12
00 s Sakha was the capital of the province of Gharbia. By the time of Ibn Duqmaq it was no longer the provincial capital but it remained a large city that lent its name to a major subdistrict of the province.6 The 1885 Census of Egypt recorded Sakha as a nahiyah under the district of Kafr El Sheikh in Gharbia Governorate at that time the population of the town was 950 480 men and 470 women.7 Christian tradition holds that Sakha was one of the places that the family of Jesus visited during their Flight into Egypt. In 1984 a stone said to bear the footprint of Jesus was found the stone was authorized by Coptic Pope Shenouda III and several miracles have been attributed to it.8 See alsoedit List of ancient Egyptian towns and cities Referencesedit             StTakla.org. sttakla.org.
