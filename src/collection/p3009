53 present Egypt portal v t e Roman Egyptnote 1 was an imperial province of the Roman Empire from 30 BC to AD 641. The province encompassed most of modernday Egypt except for the Sinai. It was bordered by the provinces of Crete and Cyrenaica to the west and Judaea later Arabia Petraea to the East. Egypt was conquered by Roman forces in 30 BC and became a province of the new Roman Empire upon its formation in 27 BC. Egypt came to serve as a major producer of grain for the empire and had a highly developed urban economy. It was by far the wealthiest Roman province outside of Italy.2 The population of Roman Egypt is unknown although estimates vary from 4 to 8 million.31 Alexandria its capital was the largest port and second largest city of the Roman Empire.45 Three Roman legions garrisoned Egypt in the early Roman imperial period with the garrison later reduced to two alongside auxilia formations of the Roman army.6 The major town of each nome administrative region was known as a metropolisnote 2 and granted additional privileges.6 The inhabitants of Roman Egypt were divided by social class along ethnic and cultural lines.6 Most inhabitants were peasant farmers who lived in rural villages and spoke the Egyptian language which evolved from the Demotic Egyptian of the Late and Ptolemaic periods to Coptic under Roman rule. In each metropolis the citizens spoke Koine Greek and followed a Hellenistic culture. However there was considerable social mobility increasing urbanization and both the rural and urban population were involved in trade and had high literacy rates.6 In AD 212 the Constitutio Antoniniana gave Roman citizenship to all free Egyptians.6 The Antonine Plague struck in the late 
2 nd century but Roman Egypt recovered by the 
3 rd century.6 Having escaped much of the Crisis of the Third Century Roman Egypt fell under the control of the breakaway Palmyrene Empire after an invasion of Egypt by Zenobia in 2
69.7  The emperor Aurelian r.270275 successfully besieged Alexandria and recovered Egypt. The usurpers Domitius Domitianus and Achilleus took control of the province in opposition to emperor Diocletian r.284305 who recovered it in 2972
98.7  Diocletian then introduced administrative and economic reforms. These coincided with the Christianization of the Roman Empire especially the growth of Christianity in Egypt.7 After Constantine the Great gained control of Egypt in AD 324 the emperors promoted Christianity.7 The Coptic language derived from earlier forms of Egyptian emerged among the Christians of Roman Egypt.6 Under Diocletian the frontier was moved downriver to the First Cataract of the Nile at Syene Aswan withdrawing from the Dodekaschoinos region.7 This southern frontier was largely peaceful for many centuries7 likely garrisoned by limitanei of the late Roman army. Regular units also served in Egypt including Scythians known to have been stationed in the Thebaid by Justinian the Great r.527565. Constantine introduced the gold solidus coin which stabilized the economy.7 The trend towards private ownership of land became more pronounced in the 
5 th century and peaked in the 
6 th century with large estates built up from many individual plots.7 Some large estates were owned by Christian churches and smaller landholders included those who were themselves both tenant farmers on larger estates and landlords of tenantfarmers working their own land.7 The First Plague Pandemic arrived in the Mediterranean Basin with the emergence of the Justinianic Plague at Pelusium in Roman Egypt in 541. Egypt was conquered by the Sasanian Empire in 618 who ruled the territory for a decade but it was returned to the Eastern Roman Empire by the defection of the governor in 628. Egypt permanently ceased to be a part of the Roman Empire in 641 when it became part of the Rashidun Caliphate following the Muslim conquest of Egypt. Formationedit The Ptolemaic Kingdom r.30530 BC the Thirtyfirst Dynasty had ruled Egypt since the Wars of Alexander the Great that overthrew Achaemenid Egypt. The Ptolemaic pharaoh Cleopatra VII sided with Julius Caesar during Caesars Civil War 4945 BC and Caesars subsequent Roman dictatorship. After Caesars assassination in 44 BC Cleopatra aligned Egypt with Mark Antony the Roman triumvir who controlled the eastern Mediterranean. In the last war of the Roman Republic 3230 BC Antony with Cleopatras support fought against Octavian. The decisive naval Battle of Actium was won by Octavian who then invaded Egypt. Following the Battle of Alexandria the defeated Antony and Cleopatra killed themselves.6 The Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt ceased to exist Egypt was seized by Octavian as his personal possession.6 The legal status was settled in 27 BC when Octavian was granted the honorific name of Augustus and Egypt became an imperial province of the newly established Roman empire. Augustus and succeeding Roman emperors ruled Egypt as the Roman pharaoh. The Ptolemaic institutions were dismantled the government administration was wholly reformed as was the social structure though some bureaucratic elements were maintained.6 The GraecoEgyptian legal system of the Hellenistic period continued in use but within the bounds of Roman law.6 The tetradrachm coinage minted at the Ptolemaic capital of Alexandria continued to be the currency of an increasingly monetized economy but its value was made equal to the Roman denarius.6 Augustus introduced land reforms that enabled wider entitlement to private ownership of land previously rare under the Ptolemaic cleruchy system of allotments under royal ownership and the local administration reformed into a Roman liturgical system in which landowners were required to serve in local government.6 The priesthoods of the Ancient Egyptian deities and Hellenistic religions of Egypt kept most of their temples and privileges and in turn the priests also served the Roman imperial cult of the deified emperors and their families.6 Roman government in Egyptedit Further information List of governors of Roman Egypt As Rome overtook the Ptolemaic system in place for areas of Egypt they made many changes. The effect of the Roman conquest was at first to strengthen the position of the Greeks and of Hellenism against Egyptian influences. Some of the previous offices and names of offices under the Hellenistic Ptolemaic rule were kept some were changed and some names would have remained but the function and administration would have changed. The Romans introduced important changes in the administrative system aimed at achieving a high level of efficiency and maximizing revenue. The duties of the prefect of Aegyptus combined responsibility for military security through command of the legions and cohorts for the organization of finance and taxation and for the administration of justice.

05.8 57 In these first three centuries of Roman Egypt the whole country came under the central Roman control of single governor officially called in Latin praefectus Alexandreae et Aegypti lit.prefect of Alexandria and Egypt and more usually referred to as the Latin praefectus Aegypti lit.prefect of Egypt or the Koin Greek   romanized eparchos Aigyptou lit.Eparch of Egypt.857 The double title of the governor as prefect of Alexandria and Egypt reflects the distinctions between Upper and Lower Egypt and Alexandria since Alexandria outside the Nile Delta was not within the thenprevailing traditional geographic boundaries of Egypt.857 From the 
1 st century BC the Roman governor of Egypt was appointed by the emperor for a multiyear term and given the rank of prefect Latin praefectus.6 Both the governor and the major officials were of equestrian rank unlike other Roman provinces which had governors of senatorial rank.6 The prefect of Egypt had more or less equivalent civil and military powers imperium to a proconsul since a Roman law a lex granted him proconsular imperium Latin imperium ad similitudinem proconsulis.857 Unlike in senatorial provinces the prefect was responsible for the collection of certain taxes and for the organization of the allimportant grain shipments from Egypt including the annona.858 Because of these financial responsibilities the governors administration had to be closely controlled and organized.858 The governorship of Egypt was the secondhighest office available to the equestrian class on the cursus honorum after that of the praetorian prefect Latin praefectus praetorio the commander of the imperial Praetorian Guard and one of the highestpaid receiving an annual salary of 200000 sesterces a ducenarian post.858 The prefect was appointed at the emperors discretion officially the governors status and responsibilities mirrored those of the augustus himself his fairness aequitas equality and his foresight providentia providence.858 From the early 
2 nd century service as the governor of Egypt was frequently the penultimate stage in the career of a praetorian prefect.858 The first generations of the imperial Severan dynasty depicted on the Severan Tondo from Egypt Antikensammlung Berlin The governors powers as prefect which included the rights to make edicts ius edicendi and as the supreme judicial authority to order capital punishment ius gladii right of swords expired as soon as his successor arrived in the provincial capital at Alexandria who then also took up overall command of the Roman legions of the Egyptian garrison.858 Initially three legions were stationed in Egypt with only two from the reign of Tiberius r.1437 AD.858 The official duties of the praefectus Aegypti are well known because enough records survive to reconstruct a mostly complete official calendar fasti of the governors engagements.857 Yearly in Lower Egypt and once every two years in Upper Egypt the praefectus Aegypti held a conventus Koin Greek  romanized dialogismos lit.dialogue during which legal trials were conducted and administrative officials practices were examined usually between January Ianuarius and April Aprilis in the Roman calendar.858 Evidence exists of more than 60 edicts issued by the Roman governors of Egypt.858 To the government at Alexandria besides the prefect of Egypt the Roman emperors appointed several other subordinate procurators for the province all of equestrian rank and at least from the reign of Commodus r.176192 of similar ducenarian salary bracket.858 The administrator of the Idios Logos responsible for special revenues like the proceeds of bona caduca property and the iuridicus Koin Greek  romanized dikaiodotes lit.giver of laws the senior legal official were both imperially appointed.858 From the reign of Hadrian r.117138 the financial powers of the prefect and the control of the Egyptian temples and priesthoods was devolved to other procurators a dioiketes  the chief financial officer and an archiereus  archpriest.858 A procurator could deputize as the prefects representative where necessary.858 Statue of an orator wearing a himation from Heracleopolis Magna in Middle Egypt Egyptian Museum Cairo Procurators were also appointed from among the freedmen manumitted slaves of the imperial household including the powerful procurator usiacus responsible for state property in the province.858 Other procurators were responsible for revenue farming of state monopolies the procurator ad Mercurium oversight of farm lands the procurator episkepseos of the warehouses of Alexandria the procurator Neaspoleos and of exports and emigration the procurator Phari procurator of the Pharos.858 These roles are poorly attested with often the only surviving information beyond the names of the offices is a few names of the incumbents. In general the central provincial administration of Egypt is no betterknown than the Roman governments of other provinces since unlike in the rest of Egypt the conditions for the preservation of official papyri were very unfavourable at Alexandria.858 Local government in the hinterland Koin Greek  romanized khr lit.countryside outside Alexandria was divided into traditional regions known as nomoi.858 The mtropoleis were governed by magistrates drawn from the liturgy system these magistrates as in other Roman cities practised euergetism and built public buildings. To each nome the prefect appointed a strategos Koin Greek  romanized stratgs lit.general the strategoi were civilian administrators without military functions who performed much of the government of the country in the prefects name and were themselves drawn from the Egyptian upper classes.858 The strategoi in each of the mtropoleis were the senior local officials served as intermediaries between the prefect and the villages and were legally responsible for the administration and their own conduct while in office for several years.858 Each strategos was supplemented by a royal scribe   basiliks grammates royal secretary.858 These scribes were responsible for their nomes financial affairs including administration of all property land land revenues and temples and what remains of their recordkeeping is unparalleled in the ancient world for its completeness and complexity.858 The royal scribes could act as proxy for the strategoi but each reported directly to Alexandria where dedicated financial secretaries  appointed for each individual nome  oversaw the accounts an eklogistes and a graphon ton nomon.858 The eklogistes was responsible for general financial affairs while the graphon ton nomon likely dealt with matters relating to the Idios Logos.85859 In 200201 the emperor Septimius Severus r.193211 granted each metropolis and the city of Alexandria a boul a Hellenistic town council.6 Bronze statue of a nude youth from Athribis in Lower Egypt British Museum London The nomoi were grouped traditionally into those of Upper and Lower Egypt the two divisions each being known as an epistrategy after the chief officer the epistrategos  epistratgs overgeneral each of whom was also a Roman procurator. Soon after the Roman annexation a new epistrategy was formed encompassing the area just south of Memphis and the Faiyum region and named the Heptanomia and the Arsinoite nome.858 In the Nile Delta however power was wielded by two of the epistrategoi.858 The epistrategoss role was mainly to mediate between the prefect in Alexandria and the strategoi in the mtropoleis and they had few specific administrative duties performing a more general function.858 Their salary was sexagenarian  60000 sesterces annually.858 Each village or kome  km was served by a village scribe  kmogrammates secretary of the kome whose term possibly paid was usually held for three years.859 Each to avoid conflicts of interest was appointed to a community away from their home village as they were required to inform the strategoi and epistrategoi of the names of persons due to perform unpaid public service as part of the liturgy system.859 They were required to be literate and had various duties as official clerks.859 Other local officials drawn from the liturgy system served for a year in their home kome they included the practor  prktr executor who collected certain taxes as well as security officers granary officials  sitologoi grain collectors public cattle drivers  k dmsioi ktnotrphoi cattleherds of the demos and cargo supervisors  epiploi.859 Other liturgical officials were responsible for other specific aspects of the economy a suite of officials was each responsible for arranging supplies of particular necessity in the course of the prefects official tours.859 The liturgy system extended to most aspects of Roman administration by the reign of Trajan r.98117 though constant efforts were made by people eligible for such duties to escape their imposition.859 A 
2 ndcentury AD Roman emperor wearing nemes as pharaoh Museum Carnuntinum de Bad DeutschAltenburg The reforms of the early 
4 th century had established the basis for another 250 years of comparative prosperity in Aegyptus at a cost of perhaps greater rigidity and more oppressive state control. Aegyptus was subdivided for administrative purposes into a number of smaller provinces and separate civil and military officials were established the praeses and the dux. The province was under the supervision of the count of the Orient i.e. the vicar of the diocese headquartered in Antioch in Syria. Emperor Justinian abolished the Diocese of Egypt in 538 and recombined civil and military power in the hands of the dux with a civil deputy praeses as a counterweight to the power of the church authorities. All pretense of local autonomy had by then vanished. The presence of the soldiery was more noticeable its power and influence more pervasive in the routine of town and village life. Militaryedit Encaustic and tempera painted Fayum mummy portrait of a Roman officer c.160  c.170 with a green sagum gold fibula white tunic and red leather balteus British Museum The Roman army was among the most homogenous Roman structures and the organization of the army in Egypt differed little from its organization elsewhere in the Roman Empire. The Roman legions were recruited from Roman citizens and the Roman auxilia recruited from the noncitizen subjects.969 Egypt was unique in that its garrison was commanded by the praefectus Aegypti an official of the equestrian order rather than as in other provinces a governor of the senatorial class.975 This distinction was stipulated in a law promulgated by Augustus and because it was unthinkable that an equestrian should command a senator the commanders of the legions in Egypt were themselves uniquely of equestrian rank.975 As a result of these strictures the governor was rendered unable to build up a rival power base as Mark Antony had been able to do while the military legati commanding the legions were career soldiers formerly centurions with the senior rank of primus pilus rather than politicians whose military experience was limited to youthful service as a military tribune.975 Beneath the praefectus Aegypti the overall commander of legions and auxilia stationed in Egypt was styled in Latin praefectus stratopedarches from the Greek  romanized stratopedrchs lit.camp commander or as Latin praefectus exercitu qui est in Aegypto lit.prefect of the army in Egypt.97576 Collectively these forces were known as the exercitus Aegyptiacus Army of Egypt.976 The Roman garrison was concentrated at Nicopolis a district of Alexandria rather than at the strategic heart of the country around Memphis and Egyptian Babylon.1037 Alexandria was the Mediterraneans second city in the early Roman empire the cultural capital of the Greek East and rival to Rome under Antony and Cleopatra.1037 Because only a few papyri are preserved from the area little more is known about the legionaries everyday life than is known from other provinces of the empire and little evidence exists of the military practices of the prefect and his officers.975 Most papyri have been found in Middle Egypts villages and the texts are primarily concerned with local affairs rarely giving space to high politics and military matters.970 Not much is known about the military encampments of the Roman imperial period since many are underwater or have been built over and because Egyptian archaeology has traditionally taken little interest in Roman sites.970 Because they supply a record of soldiers service history six bronze Roman military diplomas dating between 83 and 206 are the main source of documentary evidence for the auxilia in Egypt these inscribed certificates rewarded 25 or 26 years of military service in the auxilia with Roman citizenship and the right of conubium.97071 That the army was more Greekspeaking than in other provinces is certain.975 The heart of the Army of Egypt was the Nicopolis garrison at Alexandria with at least one legion permanently stationed there along with a strong force of auxilia cavalry.971 These troops would both guard the residence of the praefectus Aegypti against uprisings among the Alexandrians and were poised to march quickly to any point at the prefects command.97172 At Alexandria too was the Classis Alexandrina the provincial fleet of the Roman Navy in Egypt.971 In the 
2 nd and 
3 rd centuries there were around 8000 soldiers at Alexandria a fraction of the megalopoliss huge population.972 Initially the legionary garrison of Roman Egypt consisted of three legions the Legio III Cyrenaica the Legio XXII Deiotariana and one other legion.970 The station and identity of this third legion is not known for sure and it is not known precisely when it was withdrawn from Egypt though it was certainly before 23 AD during the reign of Tiberius r.14
37.9 70 In the reign of Tiberiuss stepfather and predecessor Augustus the legions had been stationed at Nicopolis and at Egyptian Babylon and perhaps at Thebes.970 After August 119 the III Cyrenaica was ordered out of Egypt the XXII Deiotariana was transferred sometime afterwards and before 1278 the Legio II Traiana arrived to remain as the main component of the Army of Egypt for two centuries.970 After some fluctuations in the size and positions of the auxilia garrison in the early decades of Roman Egypt relating to the conquest and pacification of the country the auxilia contingent was mostly stable during the Principate increasing somewhat towards the end of the 
2 nd century and with some individual formations remaining in Egypt for centuries at a time.971 Three or four alae of cavalry were stationed in Egypt each ala numbering around 500 horsemen.971 There were between seven and ten cohortes of auxilia infantry each cohors about 500 hundred strong although some were cohortes equitatae  mixed units of 600 men with infantry and cavalry in a roughly 41 ratio.971 Besides the auxilia stationed at Alexandria at least three detachments permanently garrisoned the southern border on the Niles First Cataract around Philae and Syene Aswan protecting Egypt from enemies to the south and guarding against rebellion in the Thebaid.972 Besides the main garrison at Alexandrian Nicopolis and the southern border force the disposition of the rest of the Army of Egypt is not clear though many soldiers are known to have been stationed at various outposts praesidia including those defending roads and remote natural resources from attack.972 Roman detachments centuriones and beneficiarii maintained order in the Nile Valley but about their duties little is known as little evidence survives though they were in addition to the strategoi of the nomoi the prime local representatives of the Roman state.973 Archaeological work led by Hlne Cuvigny has revealed many ostraca inscribed ceramic fragments which give unprecedently detailed information on the lives of soldiers stationed in the Eastern Desert along the CoptosMyos Hormos road and at the imperial granite quarry at Mons Claudianus.972 Another Roman outpost known from an inscription existed on Farasan the chief island of the Red Seas Farasan Islands off the west coast of the Arabian Peninsula.972 As in other provinces many of the Roman soldiers in Egypt were recruited locally not only among the noncitizen auxilia but among the legionaries as well who were required to have Roman citizenship.973 An increasing proportion of the Army of Egypt was of local origin in the reign of the Flavian dynasty with an even higher proportion  as many as three quarters of legionaries  under the Severan dynasty.973 Of these around one third were themselves the offspring Latin castrenses lit.campmen of soldiers raised in the canabae settlements surrounding the armys base at Nicopolis while only about one eighth were Alexandrian citizens.973 Egyptians were given Romanstyle Latin names on joining the army unlike in other provinces indigenous names are nearly unknown among the local soldiers of the Army of Egypt.974 One of the surviving military diplomas lists the soldiers birthplace as Coptos while others demonstrate that soldiers and centurions from elsewhere retired to Egypt auxilia veterans from Chios and Hippo Regius or Hippos are named.97374 Evidence from the 
2 nd century suggests most auxilia came from Egypt with others drawn from the provinces of Africa and Syria and from Roman Asia Minor.97374 Auxilia from the Balkans who served throughout the Roman army also served in Egypt many Dacian names are known from ostraca in the Trajanic period perhaps connected with the recruitment of Dacians during and after Trajans Dacian Wars they are predominantly cavalrymens names with some infantrymens.974 Thracians common in the army in other Roman provinces were also present and an auxiliary diploma from the Egyptian garrison has been found in Thracia.974 Two auxilia diplomas connect Army of Egypt veterans with Syria including one naming Apamea.974 Large numbers of recruits mustered in Asia Minor may have supplemented the garrison after the Kitos War against a Jewish uprising in Egypt and Syria.974 Societyedit The social structure in Aegyptus under the Romans was both unique and complicated. On the one hand the Romans continued to use many of the same organizational tactics that were in place under the leaders of the Ptolemaic period. At the same time the Romans saw the Greeks in Aegyptus as Egyptians an idea that both the native Egyptians and Greeks would have rejected.11 To further compound the whole situation Jews who themselves were very Hellenized overall had their own communities separate from both Greeks and native Egyptians.11 
1 stcentury AD mummy excavated by William Flinders Petrie Most inhabitants were peasants many working as tenantfarmers for high rents in kind cultivating sacred land belonging to temples or public land formerly belonging to the Egyptian monarchy.6 The division between the rural life of the villages where the Egyptian language was spoken and the metropolis where the citizens spoke Koine Greek and frequented the Hellenistic gymnasia was the most significant cultural division in Roman Egypt and was not dissolved by the Constitutio Antoniniana of 212 which made all free Egyptians Roman citizens.6 There was considerable social mobility however accompanying mass urbanization and participation in the monetized economy and literacy in Greek by the peasant population was widespread.6 The Romans began a system of social hierarchy that revolved around ethnicity and place of residence. Other than Roman citizens a Greek citizen of one of the Greek cities had the highest status and a rural Egyptian would be in the lowest class.12 In between those classes was the metropolite who was almost certainly of Hellenic origin. Gaining citizenship and moving up in ranks was very difficult and there were not many available options for ascendancy.13 One of the routes that many followed to ascend to another caste was through enlistment in the army. Although only Roman citizens could serve in the legions many Greeks found their way in. The native Egyptians could join the auxiliary forces and attain citizenship upon discharge.14 The different groups had different rates of taxation based on their social class. Roman citizens and citizens of Alexandria were exempted from the poll tax. Hellenized inhabitants of the nome capitals paid a low rate of poll tax while native Egyptians paid a higher rate.6 Native Egyptians were barred from serving in the army and there were other defined legal distinctions between the classes.15 Within the mtropoleis there was a Hellenic sociopolitical lite an urban landowning aristocracy that dominated Egypt by the 
2 nd and throughout the 
3 rd centuries through their large private estates.6 The social structure in Aegyptus is very closely linked to the governing administration. Elements of centralized rule that were derived from the Ptolemaic period lasted into the 
4 th century. One element in particular was the appointment of strategoi to govern the nomes the traditional administrative divisions of Egypt. Boulai or town councils in Egypt were only formally constituted by Septimius Severus. It was only under Diocletian later in the 
3 rd century that these boulai and their officers acquired important administrative responsibilities for their nomes. The Augustan takeover introduced a system of compulsory public service which was based on poros property or income qualification which was wholly based on social status and power. The Romans also introduced the poll tax which was similar to tax rates that the Ptolemies levied but the Romans gave special low rates to citizens of mtropoleis.16 The city of Oxyrhynchus had many papyri remains that contain much information on the subject of social structure in these cities. This city along with Alexandria shows the diverse setup of various institutions that the Romans continued to use after their takeover of Egypt. Just as under the Ptolemies Alexandria and its citizens had their own special designations. The capital city enjoyed a higher status and more privileges than the rest of Egypt. Just as it was under the Ptolemies the primary way of becoming a citizen of Roman Alexandria was through showing when registering for a deme that both parents were Alexandrian citizens. Alexandrians were the only Egyptians that could obtain Roman citizenship.17 Bust of Roman Nobleman c.30 BC50 AD Brooklyn Museum If a common Egyptian wanted to become a Roman citizen he would first have to become an Alexandrian citizen. The Augustan period in Egypt saw the creation of urban communities with Hellenic landowning elites. These landowning elites were put in a position of privilege and power and had more selfadministration than the Egyptian population. Within the citizenry there were gymnasiums that Greek citizens could enter if they showed that both parents were members of the gymnasium based on a list that was compiled by the government in 45 AD.18 The candidate for the gymnasium would then be let into the ephebus. There was also the council of elders known as the gerousia. This council of elders did not have a boulai to answer to. All of this Greek organization was a vital part of the metropolis and the Greek institutions provided an elite group of citizens. The Romans looked to these elites to provide municipal officers and welleducated administrators.18 These elites also paid lower polltaxes than the local native Egyptians fellahin.6 It is well documented that Alexandrians in particular were exempted from paying polltaxes and were able to enjoy lower taxrates on land.19 Egyptian landholders paid about 3 times more than the elites per aroura of land in taxrates and about 45 times more than Alexandrians per aroura of land in taxrates.19 These privileges even extended to corporal punishments. Romans were protected from this type of punishment while native Egyptians were whipped. Alexandrians on the other hand had the privilege of merely being beaten with a rod.20 Although Alexandria enjoyed the greatest status of the Greek cities in Egypt it is clear that the other Greek cities such as Antinopolis enjoyed privileges very similar to the ones seen in Alexandria for instance like Alexandrians Antinopolites were exempted from paying polltaxes.21 All of these changes amounted to the Greeks being treated as an ally in Egypt and the native Egyptians were treated as a conquered race.citation needed The Gnomon of the Idios Logos shows the connection between law and status. It lays out the revenues it deals with mainly fines and confiscation of property to which only a few groups were apt. The Gnomon also confirms that a freed slave takes his former masters social status. The Gnomon demonstrates the social controls that the Romans had in place through monetary means based on status and property. Economyedit Roman trade with India started from Aegyptus according to the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea 
1 st century. The economic resources that this imperial government existed to exploit had not changed since the Ptolemaic period but the development of a much more complex and sophisticated taxation system was a hallmark of Roman rule. Taxes in both cash and kind were assessed on land and a bewildering variety of small taxes in cash as well as customs dues and the like was collected by appointed officials. A massive amount of Aegyptus grain was shipped downriver north both to feed the population of Alexandria and for export to the Roman capital. There were frequent complaints of oppression and extortion from the taxpayers. For land management and tenure the Ptolemaic state had retained much of the categorization of land as under the earlier pharaohs but the Roman Empire introduced a distinction between private and public lands  the earlier system had categorized little land as private property  and a complex arrangement was developed consisting of dozens of types of landholding.222324 Lands status was determined by the hydrological juridical and function of the property as well as by the three main categories of ownership held over from the Ptolemaic system the sacred property belonging to the temples Koin Greek   romanized Hier g lit.holy land the royal land   Basilik g royal land belonging to the state and forming most of its revenue and the gifted land Koin Greek    romanized g en dre lit.land in gift  Dre gifts leased out under the cleruchy system.222324 The Roman government had actively encouraged the privatization of land and the increase of private enterprise in manufacture commerce and trade and low tax rates favored private owners and entrepreneurs. The poorer people gained their livelihood as tenants of stateowned land or of property belonging to the emperor or to wealthy private landlords and they were relatively much more heavily burdened by rentals which tended to remain at a fairly high level. Overall the degree of monetization and complexity in the economy even at the village level was intense. Goods were moved around and exchanged through the medium of coin on a large scale and in the towns and the larger villages a high level of industrial and commercial activity developed in close conjunction with the exploitation of the predominant agricultural base. The volume of trade both internal and external reached its peak in the

A series of debasements of the imperial currency had undermined confidence in the coinage24 and even the government itself was contributing to this by demanding more and more irregular tax payments in kind which it channelled directly to the main consumers the army personnel. Local administration by the councils was careless recalcitrant and inefficient the evident need for firm and purposeful reform had to be squarely faced in the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine I. There are numerous indications of Roman trade with India during the period particularly between Roman Egypt and the Indian subcontinent. Kushan Empire ruler Huvishka 150180 CE incorporated in his coins the HellenisticEgyptian god Serapis under the name  Sarapo.2325 Since Serapis was the supreme deity of the pantheon of Alexandria in Egypt this coin suggests that Huvishka had as strong orientation towards Roman Egypt which may have been an important market for the products coming from the Kushan Empire.23 Architectureedit Roman emperor Trajan making offerings to Egyptian Gods on the Roman Mammisi at the Dendera Temple complex Egypt.26 In the administrative provincial capitals of the nomoi the mtropoleis mostly inherited from the Pharaonic and Ptolemaic period Roman public buildings were erected by the governing strategos and the local gymnasiarch.27189 In most cases these have not survived and evidence of them is rare but it is probable that most were built in the classical architecture of the GraecoRoman world employing the classical orders in stone buildings.27189 Prominent remains include two Roman theatres at Pelusium a temple of Serapis and a tetrastyle at Diospolis Magna at Thebes and at Philae a triumphal arch and temples dedicated to the worship of the emperor Augustus and the goddess Roma the personification of Rome.27189 Besides a few individual stone blocks in some mtropoleis substantial remains of Roman architecture are known in particular from three of the mtropoleis  Heracleopolis Magna Oxyrhynchus and Hermopolis Magna  as well as from Antinopolis a city founded c.130 by the emperor Hadrian r.1171
38.2 7189 All these were sacred cities dedicated to particular deities.27189 The ruins of these cities were first methodically surveyed and sketched by intellectuals attached to Napoleons campaign in Egypt eventually published in the Description de lgypte series.27189 Illustrations produced by EdmeFranois Jomard and Vivant Denon form much of the evidence of these remains because since the 
19 th century many of the ruins have themselves disappeared.27189 South of Thebes the mtropoleis may have been largely without classical buildings but near Antinopolis the classical influence may have been stronger.27189 Most mtropoleis were probably built on the classical Hippodamian grid employed by the Hellenistic polis as at Alexandria with the typical Roman pattern of the Cardo northsouth and Decumanus Maximus eastwest thoroughfares meeting at their centres as at Athribis and Antinopolis.27189 Vivant Denon made sketches of ruins at Oxyrhynchus and EdmeFranois Jomard wrote a description together with some historical photographs and the few surviving remains these are the best evidence for the classical architecture of the city which was dedicated to the medjed a sacred species of Mormyrus fish.27189 Two groups of buildings survive at Heracleopolis Magna sacred to HeraclesHercules which is otherwise known from Jomards work which also forms the mainstay of knowledge about the architecture of Antinopolis founded by Hadrian in honour of his deified lover Antinous.27189 The Napoleonicera evidence is also important for documenting Hermopolis Magna where more buildings survive and which was dedicated to the worship of Thoth equated with HermesMercury.27189 The oldest known remains of church architecture in Egypt are at the Roman village of Kellis following the house church of the early 
4 th century a threeaisled apsed basilica church was built in the Constantinian period with pastaphoria on either side while a third church was accompanied by a Christian cemetery.28671 All these churches were built on an eastwest axis with the liturgical focus at the east and the pastaphoria siderooms were a common mark of churches in the country.28671 Churches were built quickly after the victory of Constantine over Licinius and in the 
4 th century even towns like Ain elGedida in the Dakhla Oasis had their own churches.28671 The earliest known monumental basilica of which remains survive is that at Antinopolis a fiveaisled apsed basilica facing east and set in a cemetery is 60 metres 200 ft long and 20 metres 66 ft wide.28671 North apse of the Red Monastery of Sohag In the late 
4 th century monastic churches differed from the other churches by building rectangular sanctuaries  rather than semicircular ones  at their east ends where the altar stood and in place of the apse was an aedicula or niche embellished with an arch and columns in applied in plaster.28671 In the 
5 th century regional styles of monumental church basilica with pastaphoria emerged on the coast of the Mediterranean and throughout the northern part of the country the churches were basilicas of three or five aisles but in Middle Egypt and Upper Egypt the basilicas were often given a colonnade all the way around the structure forming a continuous ambulatory by the addition of a transverse fourth aisle to the west of the other three.28671672 In eastern Egypt the columns and colonnade were emphasized and the sanctuary distinguished with a triumphal arch in front of it.28671672 A transept plan was adopted only in urban environments like Abu Mena and Marea in the western Nile Delta.28673 In the middle 
5 th century the Great Basilica one of the largest churches in Egypt was built at Hermopolis Magna at the central crossroads of the city.28673 Unusually the threeaisled transept basilica had semicircular extensions on the north and south walls.28673 At the Coptic White Monastery at Sohag the 
5 thcentury church was built with a triconch apse an unusual design also found at Sohags Dayr Anb Bishoi in the Wadi El Natrun at Dayr asSuyrn in the Dakhla Oasis in the Western Desert at Dayr Ab Matt and at Dendera.28674 The tombchapel of the White Monasterys founder Shenoute was also built with this triconch plan and was the first instance of a monastic founders tomb built in a monastery.28673 Some of the White Monasterys limestone ashlars were spolia the stones were likely taken from the pharaonic buildings at Upper Egyptian Athribis nearby.28674 The main churchs interior is a threeaisled basilica with an ambon and seat and the usual Egyptian western transverse aisle but its exterior resembles an Egyptian temple with cavetto cornices on the roof.28674 Unusually for the Coptic churches the White Monasterys church has two narthexes perhaps to accommodate worshippers from outside the monastic community.28674 The affiliated Red Monastery nearby preserves the most extensive painted decoration from Late Antiquity anywhere and is probably representative of the periods Egyptian churches interior decoration.28674 Besides the main monumental basilica at Antinopolis there were two other cruciform churches built there in the later 
5 th century.28671 Religionedit Imperial cultedit Main article Roman imperial cult Possible personification of the province of Egypt from the Temple of Hadrian in Rome National Roman Museum The worship of Egypts rulers was interrupted entirely by the fall of the Ptolemaic dynasty who together with their predecessor Alexander the Great had been worshipped with an EgyptoHellenistic ruler cult.2998 After the Roman conquest of Egypt Augustus instituted a new Roman imperial cult in Egypt.2998 Formally the Roman people Latin populus Romanus were now collectively the ruler of Egypt emperors were never crowned pharaoh in person in the traditional way and there is no evidence that the emperors were systematically incorporated into the traditional pantheons worshipped by the traditional priesthoods.30435 Instead the image of Augustus was identified with Zeus Eleutherios Greek  lit. liberator and modelled on the example of Alexander the Great who was said to have liberated Egypt from the old pharaohs.30435 Nevertheless in 27 BC there was at Memphis as was traditional a high priest of Ptah appointed under Augustuss authority as the senior celebrant of the Egyptian ruler cult and referred to as a priest of Caesar.30435 Augustus had been honoured with a cult in Egypt before his death and there is evidence that Nero was worshipped while still living as was Hadrian in particular.30437 While alive however the emperor was usually honoured with offerings to the various gods for his health Latin pro salute usually only after the emperors death was he deified and worshipped as a god.30437 A letter of Claudius written to the Alexandrians in 41 AD rejects the offer of a cult of himself permitting only divine honours such as statues and reserving cult worship for the deified Augustus.30438 For juridical purposes the imperial oath recalling Ptolemaic precedent had to be sworn in the name or fortune tyche of the emperor I swear by Caesar Imperator son of God Zeus Eleutherios Augustus.30437 The official cult was superintended by the archiereus for Alexandria and All Egypt      archieres Alexandras ka Aigyptou pss who was procurator in charge of Egypts temples and responsible for the worship of the imperial deities and of Serapis throughout the country.299598 As with the praefectus Aegypti the archiereus of Alexandria and All Egypt was a Roman citizen and probably appointed from the equestrian class.2995 The official cult in Egypt differed from that in other provinces the goddess Roma closely associated with the Roman Senate was not introduced by Augustus since as an imperial province Egypt lay beyond the reach of the Senates powers imperium.2998 The archiereus for Alexandria and All Egypt was appointed by the emperor.2995 The high priests full title high priest of the gods Augusti and the Great Serapis and the one who is responsible for the temples of Egypt and the whole country indicates that the cult of Serapis was closely connected with the worship of the emperors and that both were overseen by the same Roman official.299495 Nilus the river god of Egypts Nile with cornucopia wheatsheaf sphinx and crocodile Braccio Nuovo. Sculpture from Romes Temple of Isis and Serapis. An archiereus existed in each of the nomoi drawn from the local elite through the liturgy system these high priests were responsible for the maintenance of the imperial temples and cults in their mtropoleis.2998 These officials in place since the mid
1 st century AD at latest was each known as the high priest of the Lords Augusti and all the gods        archieres tn kurn Sebastn ka then apntn or the high priest of the city    archieres ts ples and was responsible mainly for the organization of the imperial cult since the traditional local cults already had their own priesthoods.299293 Though imposed by the Roman state and overseen from the provincial capital the imperial cult was locally organized though direct imperial control is also attested for the cult at Alexandria.299830438 Throughout Egypt sacrificial altars dedicated to the worship of the deified emperor Augustus Koin Greek  romanized Sebasts lit.Venerable were set up in dedicated temples sebasteia or caesarea.298698 Each sebasteion or caesareum had administrative functions as well as organizing the local cult of the emperor.2986 Nevertheless there is scant evidence that the worship of the emperors was common in private settings and the Alexandrians were frequently hostile to the emperors themselves.2998 The form of the imperial cult established in the reign of Augustus which may have been largely focused on the deified first emperor himself continued until the reign of Constantine the Great.30437 The widow of the emperor Trajan the augusta Plotina was deified after her death by Hadrian.3114 At Dendera in a temple dedicated to Aphrodite the late empress was identified with the Egyptian goddess Hathor the first instance of a member of the imperial family  besides the emperor himself  being integrated into the Egyptian pantheon.3114 Unlike the royal cult of the Ptolemaic dynasty whose festivals were celebrated according to the Egyptian calendar the imperial cult days such as the emperors birthdays Koin Greek   romanized hmrai sebasta lit.venerable days fell according to the Roman calendar.30438 Cult of Serapis and Isisedit Enthroned statue of the syncretic god Serapis with Cerberus from Pozzuoli National Archaeological Museum Naples Serapis was a syncretic god of abundance and the afterlife which united Hellenistic and Egyptian features and which had been instituted by Ptolemy I Soter r.305304282 BC at the beginning of the Ptolemaic period possibly related to the cult of OsirisApis.32439 Serapis assumed the role of Osiris in the Egyptian pantheon as god of the afterlife and regeneration the husband of the fertility goddess Isis and the father of the child Horus known to the Hellenistic world as Harpocrates.32439 Emperors were sometimes depicted as Serapis with their portraits bearing Serapiss distinguishing features who unlike most native Egyptian gods but in common with Osiris was never depicted in animal or partanimal form.32439 Caracalla took the title Philosarapis to indicate his devotion to the cult.32439 Serapis was distinguished by his Greekstyle clothes long hair and beard as well as by his flattopped crown known as a calathus.32439 The Mysteries of Isis a mystery cult developed outside Egypt and reimported to the country from Roman territories elsewhere were increasingly celebrated and Isis was the supreme female deity and creatorgoddess in the pantheon incorporating the Ptolemaic queenworship tradition.32439 As Isis lactans suckling Isis she was an image of motherhood feeding her infant Harpocrates as Isis myrionymos the myriadnamed she was a goddess of magic and mysteries.32439 In Roman Egypt the cult was superintended by the archiereus for Alexandria and All Egypt.299495 Temples of Serapis serapea were found throughout Egypt with the oldest serapeum at Memphis and the greatest the Serapeum of Alexandria.32439 The holy family of Serapis Isis and Harpocrates was worshipped throughout the empire by the 
4 th century the cult had become behind Christianity the most popular religion in the Roman world.32439 Templesedit The imperiallyappointed archiereus for Alexandria and All Egypt was responsible for the administrative management of the temples beyond those of the imperial cult dedicated to GraecoRoman deities and the ancient Egyptian gods.2995 He controlled access to the priesthoods of the Egyptian cults the ritual circumcision of candidates was subject to his approval and he mediated disputes involving temples wielding some judicial powers.2993 As sponsors of temple cults emperors appeared in traditional pharaonic regalia on carved temple reliefs.30435 Similarly Egyptian gods were sometimes shown wearing Roman military garb particularly Anubis and Horus.32439 The history of Egyptian temples in Roman times can be studied particularly well in some settlements at the edges of the Faiyum Archaeological evidence along with lots of written sources on the daily life of the priests are available from Bakchias Narmouthis Soknopaiou Nesos Tebtunis and Theadelphia. For instance temples can be seen supporting each other by asking colleagues to assist when there was a shortage of staff but also competing with each other for spheres of influence. When temples came into conflict with authorities then mainly with lower administrative officials who belonged to the local population themselves the Roman procurators intervened in these conflicts if at all then in a moderating manner.33 
4 thcentury relief of the god Horus as a Roman cavalryman killing the crocodile Setekh Louvre The JulioClaudian emperors Tiberius Caligula Claudius and Nero all sponsored religious monuments and institutions at Coptos and Dendera.3113 Tiberius is known to have patronized monuments at Armant Aswan Athribis Debod Diospolis Parva Edfu Karnak Kom Ombo Luxor Philae and at the Temple of Shenhur.3113 Claudiuss patronage is recorded at Aswan Athribis Esna Kom Ombo and at Philae.3113 Nero is recorded as having sponsored Egyptian elites at the Dakhla Oasis in the Western Desert and at Karanis and Akoris as well as at Aswan and Kom Ombo.3113 During the short reigns of Galba and of the contestants in the Year of the Four Emperors after the fall of Nero images of both Otho and Galba were carved in reliefs at Medinet Habu a Pharaonic temple dating from the Eighteenth Dynasty but no monuments to Vitellius are known.3113 The Flavian emperors Vespasian Titus and Domitian are all known to have been responsible for works at Esna.3114 Both Vespasian and his older son Titus sponsored work at the Dakhla Oasis with Vespasian also the sponsor of work at Medinet Habu.3114 Vespasian and his younger son Domitian were both credited with patronage of works at Kom Ombo and Silsila and Domitians sponsorship was also recorded at Akhmim Armant Dendera and Philae.3114 185 scenes in many temples show Domitian concentrated in the oases and in Upper Egypt his name was in some places removed as a result of his damnatio memoriae.34413

3 rd century aggravated the decline of the Egyptian temples the mtropoleis now given administrative control over the temples of their nomoi did not prioritize their upkeep.34413 Copperalloy statuettes of Egyptian gods Anubis left and Horus centre as Roman officers with contrapposto stances National Archaeological Museum Athens With a carved relief at Esna Septimius Severus was commemorated together with his son and coaugustus Caracalla his wife Julia Domna the augusta and their younger son Geta on the occasion of the imperial tour of Egypt in 1992

3 rd century.34413 After Philip the Arabs cartouche was added to the temple wall at Esna his successor Deciuss cartouche was carved into it the last known instance of this longestablished practice of usurping pharaohs erasure of their predecessors dynastic legacy.3121 Philip the Arabs reign saw the last Roman inscription found in the Temple of Kalabsha at some time thereafter the site was abandoned by the Romans.3122 At Tahta in Middle Egypt the cartouche of Maximinus Daza was added to a sinceruined temple along with other additions he is the last Roman emperor known to have been recorded in official hieroglyphic script.312526 The last Buchis bull of Hermonthis Armant was born in the reign of Licinius and died in the reign of Constantius II the cartouche on its funerary stela dedicated in 340 is the last of all.344133128 Under the Theodosian dynasty during the joint reigns of Theodosius the Great and his sons Arcadius and Honorius an inscription at Philaes Temple of Harendotes commemorated the birthday of Osiris in the 1

3 rdcentury Sextus Julius Africanuss chronology was probably the source of the 
4 thcentury bishop Eusebius of Caesareas narrative of Marks arrival in Egypt which conflicts with that of the Secret Gospel of Mark and is the earliest history of Alexandrian Christianity including the names of the ten bishops who supposedly succeeded Mark before the late 
2 ndcentury episcopate of Julian of Alexandria.36475 The drive to connect Alexandria with the lives of New Testament characters was part of a desire to establish continuity and apostolic succession with the churches supposed to have been founded by Saint Peter and the other apostles.36475 Christianity probably arrived in Egypt among the Hellenized Alexandrian Jews from Palestines communities of Jewish Christians.28665 A possible 
2 ndcentury papyrus fragment of the Gospel of Peter from the Oxyrhynchus Papyri P. Oxy. LX 4009 Sackler Library The earliest evidence of Christianity in Egypt is a letter written in the first half of the 
3 rd century and mentioning the gymnasiarch and the boul thereby indicating the author and recipient were of the upper class uses the Christian nomina sacra and the Biblical Greek   romanized en kyri lit.in the Lord drawn from the Pauline epistles.36480 Another papyrus from the same period records the names of candidates for liturgy service supervision of the watertower and fountains of the metropolis of Arsino Faiyum among the names is one Antonios Dioscoros son of Origen Alexandrian against whose name is noted in Koin Greek    romanized sti Diskoros chrstians lit.he is the Dioscoros who is a Christian.36480 With Alexandrian citizenship and a Roman nomen Antonios Latin Antonius was likely of higher social status than the other candidates on the list and is the first named Egyptian Christian for which evidence exists.36480 In the Chora beyond Alexandria there is no evidence at all for Christianity in the 
2 nd century excepting some ambiguous letters besides some papyrus fragments of scriptures among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri and among the papyri found at Antinopolis and Hipponon Qarara in the Heracleopolite nome around Heracleopolis Magna.36480 Many of these are in the form of codices rather than scrolls the codex being preferred by Christian scribes.36478 Among the

By 200 it is clear that Alexandria was one of the great Christian centres. The Christian apologists Clement of Alexandria and Origen both lived part or all of their lives in that city where they wrote taught and debated. With the Edict of Milan in 313 Constantine I ended the persecution of Christians. Over the course of the 
5 th century paganism was suppressed and lost its following as the poet Palladas pointedly noted. It lingered underground for many decades the final edict against paganism was issued in 435 but graffiti at Philae in Upper Egypt proves worship of Isis persisted at its temples into the 
6 th century. Many Egyptian Jews also became Christians but many others refused to do so leaving them as the only sizable religious minority in a Christian country. No sooner had the Egyptian Church achieved freedom and supremacy than it became subject to a schism and prolonged conflict which at times descended into civil war. Alexandria became the centre of the first great split in the Christian world between the Arians named for the Alexandrian priest Arius and their opponents represented by Athanasius who became Archbishop of Alexandria in 326 after the First Council of Nicaea rejected Ariuss views. The Arian controversy caused years of riots and rebellions throughout most of the 
4 th century. In the course of one of these the great temple of Serapis the stronghold of paganism was destroyed. Athanasius was alternately expelled from Alexandria and reinstated as its Archbishop between five and seven times. Coptic cross and chirho carved into older reliefs at the Temple of Isis at Philae Patristic authorship was dominated by Egyptian contributions Athanasius Didymus the Blind and Cyril and the power of the Alexandrian see embodied in Athanasius Theophilus his nephew Cyril and shortly by Dioscuros. Egypt had an ancient tradition of religious speculation enabling a variety of controversial religious views to thrive there. Not only did Arianism flourish but other doctrines such as Gnosticism and Manichaeism either native or imported found many followers. Another religious development in Egypt was the monasticism of the Desert Fathers who renounced the material world in order to live a life of poverty in devotion to the Church. Egyptian Christians took up monasticism with such enthusiasm that the Emperor Valens had to restrict the number of men who could become monks. Egypt exported monasticism to the rest of the Christian world. Another development of this period was the development of Coptic a form of the Ancient Egyptian language written with the Greek alphabet supplemented by several signs to represent sounds present in Egyptian which were not present in Greek. It was invented to ensure the correct pronunciation of magical words and names in pagan texts the socalled Greek Magical Papyri. Coptic was soon adopted by early Christians to spread the word of the gospel to native Egyptians and it became the liturgical language of Egyptian Christianity and remains so to this day. Christianity eventually spread out west to the Berbers. The Coptic Church was established in Egypt. Since Christianity blended with local traditions it never truly united the people against Arabian forces in the seventh and eight centuries.citation needed Later on in the seventh and eighth centuries Christianity spread out to Nubia.37 The fall of the Western Empire in the 
5 th century further isolated the Egyptian Romans from Romes culture and hastened the growth of Christianity. The success of Christianity led to a virtual abandonment of pharaonic traditions with the disappearance of the Egyptian priests and priestesses who officiated at the temples noone could read the hieroglyphs of Pharaonic Egypt and its temples were converted to churches or abandoned to the desert. Romanera Christianthemed woolandlinen Egyptian textile Louvre Cyril the patriarch of Alexandria convinced the citys governor to expel the Jews from the city in 415 with the aid of the mob in response to the Jews alleged nighttime massacre of many Christians. citation needed The murder of the philosopher Hypatia in March 415 marked a dramatic turn in classical Hellenic culture in Egypt but philosophy thrived in sixth century Alexandria.citation needed Another schism in the Church produced prolonged disturbances and may have alienated Egypt from the Empire. The countless papyrus finds mark the continuance of Greek culture and institutions at various levels. The new religious controversy was over the Christs human and divine nature. The issue was whether he had two natures human and divine or a combined one hypostatic union from his humanity and divinity. In an intensely religious age it was enough to divide an empire. The Miaphysite controversy arose after the First Council of Constantinople in 381 and continued until well after the Council of Chalcedon in 451 which ruled in favour of the position that Christ was one person in two natures as opposed to Monophysitism a single nature. Monophysite belief was not held by the miaphysites as they stated that Jesus was out of two natures in one nature called the Incarnate Logos of God. Many of the miaphysites claimed that they were misunderstood that there was really no difference between their position be the Chalcedonian position and that the Council of Chalcedon ruled against them because of political motivations alone. The Church of Alexandria split from the Churches of Rome and Constantinople over this issue creating what would become the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria which remains a major force in Egyptian religious life today.38 Egypt and Syria remained hotbeds of Miaphysite sentiment and organised resistance to the Chalcedonian view was not suppressed until the 5

Trilingual stela of G. Cornelius Gallus from Philae Egyptian Museum The first prefect of Aegyptus Gaius Cornelius Gallus brought Upper Egypt under Roman control by force of arms and established a protectorate over the southern frontier district which had been abandoned by the later Ptolemies. The second prefect Aelius Gallus made an unsuccessful expedition to conquer Arabia Petraea and even Arabia Felix. The Red Sea coast of Aegyptus was not brought under Roman control until the reign of Claudius. The third prefect Gaius Petronius cleared the neglected canals for irrigation stimulating a revival of agriculture. Petronius even led a campaign into presentday central Sudan against the Kingdom of Kush at Meroe whose queen Imanarenat had previously attacked Roman Egypt. Failing to acquire permanent gains in 22 BC he razed the city of Napata to the ground and retreated to the north. The reigns of Tiberius Caligula and Claudius were mainly peaceful in Egypt with intermittent civil strife between Greeks and Jews in Alexandria.3112 According to the Latin historian Tacitus Germanicus visited Egypt without the permission of Tiberius and caused a rift with his uncle the emperor.3112 Claudius refused Alexandrian demands for selfgovernment under their own senate and attempted to quell the unrest between Alexandrian Greek and Jews.3112 Under Nero perhaps influenced by Chaeremon of Alexandria  an Egyptian priest and the emperors Stoic tutor  an expedition to Mero was undertaken though possible plans for an invasion of the southern kingdom was forestalled by the military demands of the First JewishRoman War a revolt in Judaea.3113 The first praefectus Aegypti of Alexandrian origin was Tiberius Julius Alexander who was governor through the Year of the Four Emperors and who eventually proclaimed the general Vespasian victor in the Jewish War emperor at Alexandria in July 69 AD.3113 This prefect was himself of Hellenized Jewish descent and related to Philo of Alexandria.3113 The importance of the Egyptian grain harvest Latin claustra annonae lit.key to the grain supply to Rome helped Vespasian assert control over the whole empire.3113 From the reign of Nero onward Aegyptus enjoyed an era of prosperity which lasted a century. Much trouble was caused by religious conflicts between the Greeks and the Jews particularly in Alexandria which after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 became the world centre of Jewish religion and culture.citation needed Vespasian was the first emperor since Augustus to appear in Egypt.3113 At Alexandria he was hailed as pharaoh recalling the welcome of Alexander the Great at the Oracle of ZeusAmmon of the Siwa Oasis Vespasian was proclaimed the son of the creatordeity Amun ZeusAmmon in the style of the ancient pharaohs and an incarnation of Serapis in the manner of the Ptolemies.311314 As Pharaonic precedent demanded Vespasian demonstrated his divine election by the traditional methods of spitting on and trampling a blind and crippled man thereby miraculously healing him.3114 This Egyptian tradition of healing is related to the healing the man blind from birth one of the miracles of Jesus of Nazareth.3114 In 114 during the reign of Trajan r.98117 unrest among the Jews of Alexandria broke out after the coming of a Messiah was announced at Cyrene.3114 The uprising that year was defeated but between 115 and 117 a revolt continued in the countryside in the absence of the armies away on Trajans Parthian campaign.3114 This Kitos War meant that the Greeks and the Egyptian peasants took up arms in the fight against the Jews which culminated in their defeat and the effective destruction of the Alexandrian Jewish community which did not recover until the 
3 rd century.311415 The city of Oxyrhynchus by contrast celebrated their survival of the rebellion with annual festivals for at least eighty years.3115 Hadrian and Antinous GraecoRoman Museum Bronze portrait head of Hadrian Marble statue of OsirisAntinous In the reign of Trajans successor Hadrian r.117138 an Egyptian revolt was instigated on the occasion of a new Apis bulls identification in 122 this rebellion was soon suppressed.3115 Hadrian himself toured Egypt with his court for eight to ten months in 130131 embarking on a Nile cruise hunting lions in the desert and making the dawn visit to the Colossi of Memnon.3115 Hadrian founded the city of Antinopolis where his lover Antinous drowned in the river the polis joined the other three poleis as a city with Hellenic citizenship rights and he commissioned the Via Hadriana connecting Antinopolis with Berenice Troglodytica on the Red Sea.3115 In 139 at the start of the reign of Antoninus Pius r.138161 the Sothic cycle came to its end meaning that for the first time in 1460 years the heliacal rising of Sirius coincided with the Egyptian calendars New Year.3116 The emperors coinage commemorated the good fortune this was expected to portend with images of the millennial phoenix.3116 At some time during his reign Antoninus Pius visited Alexandria and had new gates and a new hippodrome built but in 153 a riot in Alexandria killed the praefectus Aegypti.3116 The destructive Antonine Plague epidemic affected Egypt from 165 to 180 evidence of mass graves from that time has been discovered by archaeological excavation in the Valley of the Queens.3117 A revolt of the native Egyptians from 171 was suppressed only in 175 after much fighting.3117 This Bucolic War named for the native herdsmen Greek  translit. Boukloi lit. cattlemen was led by one Isidorus and had defeated the Roman garrison of Egypt.3117 Control was reestablished by Avidius Cassius the governor of Roman Syria and son of an erstwhile praefectus Aegypti who then declared himself emperor in 175 being acknowledged by his own armies and the Army of Egypt amid rumours that the emperor Marcus Aurelius r.161180 was dead.3117 On the emperors approach Cassius was deposed and killed after three months rule and the clemency of Marcus Aurelius restored peace as he visited Alexandria in 1
76.3 117 Marcus Aureliuss successor Commodus r.176192 overturned his adoptive fathers pardon of Avidius Cassiuss family by having them all murdered at the beginning of his reign.3117 After Commoduss own murder Pertinax was appointed emperor on 1 January 193 but this was only officially noticed in Egypt in early March shortly before Pertinaxs murder news of this did not become known in parts of Egypt until late May.3118 Pescennius Niger r.193194 who had commanded a garrison at Aswan and the army in Syria was recognized as the reigning emperor of Egypt by June 193 with Egypt ignoring the claims made in the brief reign of Didius Julianus at Rome.3118 Granite statue of Caracalla wearing nemes and uraeus cobra headdress Alexandria National Museum Following Hadrians route Septimius Severus made a tour of Egypt in 199200 visiting the Colossi of Memnon and ordering the statues repaired which resulted in the natural singing phenomenon reported by visitors to the Colossi for centuries ceasing to be heard.3118 A series of administrative reforms probably intended to improve revenue collection included a new boul a local council or senate for Alexandria and for the mtropolis of each nome instituted in 2002
01.6 3118 Caracalla r.198217 granted Roman citizenship to all Egyptians in common with the other provincials with the 212 Constitutio Antoniniana. As a consequence many Egyptians adopted the emperors nomen gentilicium Aurelius after his imperial predecessor Marcus Aurelius as their name according to Roman naming conventions though citizenships entitlements were less valuable than in past centuries and carried a tax burden.3119 Caracalla murdered his brother and coaugustus Geta not long after their fathers death claiming selfdefence and imposing a damnatio memoriae this excuse and other defects of the emperors character were mocked by the Alexandrians as he approached Egypt in 215 angering Caracalla.3119 The emperor massacred Alexandrias welcoming delegation and allowed his army to sack the city afterwards he barred Egyptians from entering the place except where for religious or trade reasons and increased its security.3119 Macrinus r.217218 having assassinated Caracalla assumed power and dispatched a new praefectus Aegypti and breaking precedent a senator to govern Egypt. When the deaths of Macrinus and his coaugustus Diadumenian r.218 after the Battle of Antioch were announced in Alexandria the Alexandrians rose up killed the senator and forced out the prefect.3120 The victor in the civil war was Elagabalus r.218222 himself succeeded by Severus Alexander r.218222 after the formers murder but even though Severus Alexander may have visited Alexandria neither emperor is much recorded in Egyptian sources.3120 After Decius died Trebonianus Gallus r.251253 was recognized as emperor in 253 an embassy from Mero to the Romans is attested from a graffito carved at Philae.3122 Both Trebonianus Gallus and Aemilianus r.253 had coins issued in their names at Alexandria.3122 During the reigns of Valerian r.253260 and his son Gallienus r.253268 the empires instability was compounded by the Valerianic Persecution and the unprecedented total defeat and capture of Valerian by the Sasanian Empires Shapur I r.240270 at the 260 Battle of Edessa.3122 After this humiliation the army acclaimed the brothers Quietus and Macrianus r.260261 augusti they were the acknowledged emperors in Egypt.312223 When they were overthrown the Alexandrians acclaimed Lucius Mussius Aemilianus the praefectus Aegypti as their new emperor.3123 He enjoyed successes against the Blemmyes attacking the Thebaid but by August 262 Alexandria was devastated and had lost two thirds of its inhabitants amid street fighting between the loyalists of Aemilianus and Gallienus Aemilianus was defeated.3123 There was a series of revolts both military and civilian through the 
3 rd century. Under Decius in 250 the Christians again suffered from persecution but their religion continued to spread. The prefect of Aegyptus in 260 Mussius Aemilianus first supported the Macriani usurpers during the rule of Gallienus and later in 261 became a usurper himself but was defeated by Gallienus. During the existence of the breakaway Palmyrene Empire Egypt came under the rule of Zenobia.3123 Under her control the Palmyrene state went to war with Rome holding Egypt against Aurelian r.270275 his forces led by his eventual successor Probus r.276282 captured Egypt by the end of 2
71.3 123 In 272 however both Alexandria and Palmyra were again in revolt at the instigation of Firmus an Alexandrian with connections to the Blemmyes.3123 Aurelian besieged Alexandria and Firmus killed himself.3123 The reign of Aurelians successor Marcus Claudius Tacitus r.275276 left no known surviving mark on Egypt and his brother Florianus r.276 was overthrown by Probus with the support of the Army of Egypt.3123 The Blemmyes attacked Coptos and Ptolemais with incursions into Upper Egypt Probus defeated them.3123 Pompeys Pillar a monument erected by Diocletian r.284305 in the Serapeum of Alexandria represented in a mosaic from Sepphoris in Roman Palestine Later Roman Egypt

11.3 124 Diocletians reforms subdivided the empire into more numerous late Roman provinces these were grouped into thirteen Roman dioceses and these into four praetorian prefectures.3123 The old province of Aegyptus was divided with the Thebaid becoming its own province. Financial and tax reforms were implemented in Egypt in 297 and Egyptian currency was brought into line with the rest of the empires monetary reforms.312324 The role of the praefectus Aegypti was divided between a praeses  a civilian governor  and a military dux.3124 In 297 Domitius Domitianus led a revolt and made himself emperor assisted by Achilleus.3124 Diocletian captured Alexandria from them after an eightmonth siege and Pompeys Pillar was erected in his honour in the Serapeum of Alexandria.3124 Diocletian then travelled through Egypt as far as Philae where new gates were constructed for the occasion.3124 Diocletian is also known to have visited Panopolis in 2
98.3 124 He ceded the Dodekaschoinos upstream of the First Cataract in Lower Nubia to the Noba people who were subsidized by the Romans to defend the frontier now at Syene Aswan from attack by the Blemmyes.3124 Diocletians second visit to Egypt in 302 involved distributions of bread to the Alexandrians and actions taken against adherents of Manichaeism the following year Diocletian instituted the Diocletianic Persecution against Christianity.3124 The persecution was remembered as particularly intense under Satrius Arrianus and Sossianus Hierocles the praefecti between 304 and 307 and in 310 respectively.3124 The Edict of Serdica published by Galerius the senior emperor in 311 ended the Diocletianic Persecution.3124

13.3 126 Constantine may have planned a visit to Egypt in 325 since preparations were made for an imperial reception at Oxyrhynchus but these plans would have been forestalled by the convocation of the Christian First Council of Nicaea.3127 The Nicene Creed united most of the Christian Church against the Arianism promoted by the Egyptian bishop Arius and in favour of the doctrines of another Egyptian bishop Athanasius of Alexandria.3127 In 330 the Christian monastic Macarius of Egypt established his monastery at Scetis Wadi El Natrun in the Nitrian Desert.3127 On 24 February 391 the emperor Theodosius the Great r.379395 in the names of himself and his coaugusti his brotherinlaw Valentinian II r.375392 and his own son Arcadius r.383408 banned sacrifices and worship at temples throughout the empire in a decree addressed to Romes praefectus urbi.393129 On 16 June writing to the praefectus augustalis and the comes Aegypti Theodosius and his imperial colleagues reissued the ban on temple worship and sacrifices for Alexandria and Egypt specifically.393129 Folio 6 verso from the Golenischev papyrus of the Alexandrian World Chronicle showing Theophilus of Alexandria standing triumphantly on top of the Serapeum with its bust of Serapis Unrest was fomented against the pagan inhabitants by the bishop Theophilus of Alexandria who provoked riots by attempting to convert a temple into a church and staging the discovery of Christian relics.3129 These were processed through the streets and the pagans were forced to take refuge in the Serapeum with the philosopher Olympius at their head.3129 The Christian mob loyal to Theophilus sacked the Serapeum and ultimately it was rededicated as a church to John the Baptist.3129 The Serapeum of Canopus Abu Qir was looted at the same time becoming first a monastery and then a church dedicated to Cyrus and John.3129 Ammonius Grammaticus  a priest of Thoth  and the Alexandrian poet Claudian both subsequently fled Egypt for Constantinople and Rome respectively.403130 Arcadius son and successor Theodosius IIs long reign r.402450 saw the unrest generated by the bishop Cyril of Alexandria he was opposed to the doctrines of Nestorius bishop of Constantinople in relation to the title Mother of God Theotokos.3130 The faction of Cyril aided by Shenoute prevailed and Nestorius having been denounced at the 431 Council of Ephesus was banished in 435 to the Kharga Oasis in the Western Desert.3130 The see of Alexandrias bishop reached the zenith of its influence in 449 when under Dioscorus I r.444454458 it successfully defended the doctrines of Eutyches at the Second Council of Ephesus against the positions of Dioscorus rival bishops Leo I of Rome and Flavian of Constantinople.3130 The Blemmyes continued to attack Roman Egypt though they were romanticized by pagans for their resistance to the Christians. Olympiodorus of Thebes wrote a positive account of them after a visit in c.4
25.3 131 In 451 the emperor Marcian r.450457 arrived at a peace treaty with the Blemmyes which allowed them the use of the temple at Philae annually and permitted them to use and return the temples cult statues for oracular purposes.3131 Marcian however convened the 451 Council of Chalcedon overturning the conclusions of the Second Council of Ephesus condemning Dioscorus and sending him into exile.3131 The resultant and lasting schism between the Coptic Church and the state church of the Roman Empire dates from this time.3131 Proterius was appointed bishop in Dioscorus stead.3132 When the Alexandrians heard of the accession of Marcians successor Leo I they tore apart the hated Proterius and replaced him with their own nomination Timothy II whose election was not recognized by either Leo or his successor and soninlaw Zeno.3132 When Leos brotherinlaw Basiliscus seized Zenos throne in 475 his monophysitism enabled a thaw in relations between Alexandria and the eastern imperial capital but Zenos recovery of Constantinople the following year resumed the hostility.3132 Zenos attempt to repair relations between Rome Constantinople and Alexandria resulted in his own excommunication by the bishop of Rome Felix III and beginning the Acacian schism.3132 The Carmagnola an Egyptian porphyry head on Venices St Marks Basilica thought to represent Justinian I41 The Sasanian Empire invaded the Nile Delta in the reign of Anastasius I r.491518 though the Sasanian army retreated after they failed to capture Alexandria or make significant gains.3132 In the early 
6 th century and in the reign of Justin I r.518527 the Blemmyes again made attacks on Upper Egypt.3132 Justins successor Justinian I r.527565 and his wife the augusta Theodora both sought to convert the Noba to Christianity envoys of Justinian promoted dyophysitism but the Noba were persuaded to adopt the monophysitism of the Coptic Church by emissaries of the empress.3132 Newly converted they assisted the Roman army in its conquest of the pagan Blemmyes and the general Narses was in 543 sent to confiscate the cult statues of Philae which were sent to Constantinople close the temple and suppress its priesthood by imprisonment.3132 In 577 during the retirement of Justinians successor Justin II r.565574 and the start of Tiberius II Constantines reign r.574582 the defences at Philae had to be rebuilt to repel attacks by the Blemmyes.3133 This section does not cite any sources.

The reign of Constantine the Great also saw the founding of Constantinople as a new capital for the Roman Empire and in the course of the 
4 th century the Empire was divided in two with Egypt finding itself in the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. Latin never well established in Egypt would play a declining role with Greek continuing to be the dominant language of government and scholarship. During the 
5 th and 
6 th centuries the Eastern Roman Empire known historiographically as the Byzantine Empire gradually transformed itself into a thoroughly Christian state whose culture differed significantly from its pagan past. The Eastern Empire became increasingly oriental in style as its links with the old GrcoRoman world faded. The Greek system of local government by citizens had now entirely disappeared. Offices with new GreekByzantine names were almost hereditary in the wealthy landowning families. Alexandria the second city of the empire continued to be a centre of religious controversy and violence. Egypt nevertheless continued to be an important economic center for the Empire supplying much of its agriculture and manufacturing needs as well as continuing to be an important center of scholarship. It would supply the needs of the Byzantine Empire and the Mediterranean as a whole. The reign of Justinian 527565 saw the Empire recapture Rome and much of Italy from the barbarians but these successes left the empires eastern flank exposed. The Empires bread basket now lacked protection.

Main articles RomanPersian Wars and Sasanian Egypt The Sasanian conquest of Egypt beginning in AD 618 or 619 was one of the last Sassanid triumphs in the RomanPersian Wars against Roman Empire. From 619 to 628 they incorporated Egypt once again within their territories the previous longer time being under the Achaemenids. Khosrow II Parvz had begun this war on the pretext of retaliation for the assassination of Emperor Maurice 582602 and had achieved a series of early successes culminating in the conquests of Jerusalem 614 and Alexandria 619. A Byzantine counteroffensive launched by Emperor Heraclius in the spring of 622 shifted the advantage and the war was brought to an end by the fall of Khosrow on 25 February 6
28.4 3 The Egyptians had no love of the emperor in Constantinople and put up little resistance. Khosrows son and successor Kavadh II re ry who reigned until September concluded a peace treaty returning territories conquered by the Sassanids to the Eastern Roman Empire. The Sassanian conquest allowed Miaphysitism to resurface in the open in Egypt and when imperial rule was restored by Emperor Heraclius in 629 the Miaphysites were persecuted and their patriarch expelled. Egypt was thus in a state of both religious and political alienation from the Empire when a new invader appeared. Arab Islamic conquest 639646 ADedit The Mediterranean world in 650 after the Arabs had conquered Egypt and Syria from the Byzantines. Main article Muslim conquest of Egypt An army of 4000 Arabs led by Amr Ibn AlAas was sent by the Caliph Umar successor to Muhammad to spread Islamic rule to the west. Arabs crossed into Egypt from Palestine in December 63944 and advanced rapidly into the Nile Delta. The Imperial garrisons retreated into the walled towns where they successfully held out for a year or more. The Arabs sent for reinforcements and in April 641 they besieged and captured Alexandria. The Byzantines assembled a fleet with the aim of recapturing Egypt and won back Alexandria in 645. The Muslims retook the city in 646 completing the Muslim conquest of Egypt. 40000 civilians were evacuated to Constantinople with the imperial fleet thus ending 975 years of GrecoRoman rule over Egypt.
