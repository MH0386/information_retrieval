30 th Dynasty or Dynasty 30 is usually classified as the fifth Dynasty of the Late Period of ancient Egypt. It was founded after the overthrow of Nepherites II in 380 BC by Nectanebo I and was disestablished upon the invasion of Egypt by the Achaemenid king Artaxerxes III in 343 BC. This is the final native dynasty of ancient Egypt after the deposition of Nectanebo II Egypt fell under foreign domination. Historyedit A

In 365 BC Nectanebo made his son Teos coking and heir and until his death in 363 BC father and son reigned together. After his fathers death Teos invaded the Persian territories of modern Syria and Israel and was beginning to meet with some successes when he lost his throne due to the machinations of his own brother Tjahapimu.1377 Tjahepimu took advantage of Teos unpopularity within Egypt by declaring his sonand Teos nephew Nectanebo IIking. The Egyptian army rallied around Nectanebo II which forced Teos to flee to the court of the king of Persia.1379 Nectanebo IIs reign was dominated by the efforts of the Persian rulers to reconquer Egypt which they considered a satrapy in revolt. For the first ten years Nectanebo avoided the Persian reconquest because Artaxerxes III was forced to consolidate his control of the realm. Artaxerxes then attempted an unsuccessful invasion of Egypt in the winter of 351350 BC the repercussions of his defeat prompted revolts in Cyprus Phoenicia and Cilicia.1379380 Although Nectanebo gave support to these revolts Artaxerxes would eventually suppress these rebellions and was once again able to invade Egypt in 343 BC. This second invasion proved successful and Nectanebo was forced to withdraw from his defenses in the Nile Delta to Memphis where he saw that his cause was lost. He thereupon fled south to Nubia where he is assumed to have found refuge at the court of King Nastasen of Napata. Nectanebo however may have managed to maintain some form of independent rule in the south of Egypt for 2 more years since a document from Edfu is dated to his eighteenth year.1380381 Although a shadowy figure named Khababash proclaimed himself king and led a rebellion against the Persians from about 338 to 335 BC Nectanebo has been considered the last native pharaoh of Egypt. His flight marked the end of Egypt as an independent entity.1381 Pharaohs of the

The elder Nectanebo moved the capital of Egypt from Mendes to Sebennytos.2 He also engaged in many building projects across Egypt perhaps outdoing many of his predecessors Nectanebo is credited with beginning the construction of the Temple of Isis at Philae among other things.2 He respected religion and attempted to bring Egypt closer to the gods by restoring monuments and giving them gifts as well as defended Egypt from the aggressive Achaemenid Empire.2 Teos Djedhor 362360 BC Irmaatenre Khaemmaatseshemtawy Coregent with his father Nectanebo I from about 365 BC Teos became unpopular with the Egyptian people because he raised taxes to fund a military campaign to conquer Achaemenid Syria and Palestine including the satrapies of EberNari and Phoenicia.2 The kings brother Tjahapimu took advantage of this to install his own son Nectanebo II on the throne. Nectanebo II Nakhtnebef II 360343 BC Senedjemibra Setenpeninhur Merytawy The last native ruler of ancient Egypt his deposition marked the end of Egyptian hegemony until 1952. Nectanebo however was a very competent pharaoh perhaps the most energetic of the dynasty as he engaged in building and repairing monuments on a scale exceeding that of his grandfathers forged alliances with the Greek poleis and boosted the economy.3 He was overthrown by Artaxerxes III around 343 BC and fled to Nubia his subsequent fate is lost to history although some believe he died shortly after.4 Timeline of the
