26 th to 
25 th century BC for the Egyptian pharaoh Sahure of the Fifth Dynasty.
10 a It introduced a period of pyramid building by Sahures successors in Abusir on a location earlier used by Userkaf for his sun temple. The site was first thoroughly excavated by Ludwig Borchardt between March 1907 and 1908 who wrote the standard work Das Grabdenkmal des Knigs SahuRe English The Funerary Monument of King Sahure between 1910 and 1913. The pyramid complexs layout was adopted by succeeding kings of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties marking a milestone in pyramid complex construction. Compared to the preceding Fourth Dynasty the immensity of the constructions was dramatically reduced but in tandem the decorative programme proliferated and temples were augmented by enlarged storeroom complexes. The complex is estimated to have had 10000 m2 110000 sq ft of finely carved relief adorning its walls of which 150 m2 1600 sq ft has been preserved. Some of these reliefs are considered unparalleled in Egyptian art such as the 8 m 26 ft by 3 m

The complex is also remarkable for the array of valuable materials  such as granite alabaster and basalt  used extensively in its construction. The main pyramid was built from roughly hewn limestone blocks bound with mud mortar and encased with fine white Tura limestone. It had a base of about 
78.5  m 258 ft 1

50.2 9 cu long converging at either 501140 or 5030 towards the apex between 47 m 154 ft 90 cu and 48 m 157 ft 92 cu high. The architects made an error in demarcating the pyramid base extending it too far east. The pyramids internal chambers were devastated by stone thieves rendering an accurate reconstruction impossible. Stone fragments believed to belong to the kings basalt sarcophagus are the only remains of the burial that have been found. The mortuary temple adjacent to the pyramids east face comprises an entrance hall an open courtyard a fiveniche statue chapel an offering hall and storerooms. These elements had appeared in mortuary temples since the reign of Khafre. South of the temple is the enclosure with the cult pyramid employing the same construction method used in the main pyramid but on a reduced scale with a base length of

22.1  cu high. The complexs two temples are linked by a 235 m 771 ft 448 cu long intricately decorated and wellilluminated causeway. The valley temple is situated on Abusir lake and is unusual for having two entrances the main on its east side and a secondary one on its south. It remains unclear why a second entry point was built though it may have been connected to a pyramid town to its south. Sahures mortuary temple became the object of a cult of Sekhmet around the Eighteenth Dynasty. The cult was active through to the Ptolemaic Kingdom though its influence began to wane following the reign of Ramesses II. This period heralded the first wave of destruction on the Abusir monuments whilst Sahures escaped the dismantlement possibly as a result of the cults presence. The monuments stirred interest again in the TwentyFifth to TwentySixth Dynasties which is shown by the copying of reliefs from the mortuary temples of Sahure Nyuserre and Pepi II by the pharaoh Taharqa for the temple of Kawa in Nubia. A second wave of destruction of the Abusir monuments took place in the TwentySeventh Dynasty but Sahures temple was spared again the cult still being present. With the onset of the Roman period the Abusir monuments including Sahures were subjected to a third wave of destruction. At the beginning of the Christian era Sahures temple became the site of a Coptic shrine as evidenced by the recovery of pottery and graffiti dating to between the 
4 th and 
7 th century AD. Thereafter until the late 
19 th century the monuments were periodically quarried for limestone. Location and excavationedit A lithograph of the Abusir necropolis showing the locations of Sahures northernmost Nyuserres Neferirkares and Neferefres unfinished pyramids Sahure chose a site near Abusir for his funerary monument122 thus constructing the first pyramid in the region.23 Earlier Userkaf founder of the Fifth Dynasty chose Abusir for his sun temple.124 It is unclear why Userkaf sought such a remote site.25 It may have been significant for the nearby cult of Ra or in the opinion of the Egyptologist Werner Kaiser the southernmost point from which the gilded pyramidion of the pillarlike structure in the temple of Ra in Heliopolis could be seen.126 It is clear however that his decision influenced the history of Abusir27 including Sahures decision to build his monument there.28 Three of the Abusir pyramidsSahure Neferirkare and Neferefre are linked at the northwest corners by an imaginary line running to Heliopolis Iunu.2429 The diagonal was broken by Nyuserre who positioned his complex between those of Neferirkare and Sahure.24 Early excavators did not perform thorough investigations of Sahures monument perhaps discouraged by its ruined state.30 In 1838 John Shae Perring an engineer working under Colonel Howard Vyse31 cleared the entrances to the Sahure Neferirkare and Nyuserre pyramids.32 Perring was the first to enter the substructure of Sahures pyramid in modern times.30 Five years later Karl Richard Lepsius sponsored by King Frederick William IV of Prussia3334 explored the Abusir necropolis and catalogued Sahures pyramid as XVIII.32 The pyramid was also reentered by Jacques de Morgan but he too did not explore further. No further investigations were performed for the next fifty years until the Egyptologist Ludwig Borchardt visited the site.30 From 1902 to 1908 Borchardt working for the Deutsche OrientGesellschaft German Oriental Society had the Abusir pyramids resurveyed and their adjoining temples and causeways excavated.3235 From March 1907 to March 1908 Borchardt had Sahures pyramid thoroughly investigated and had trial digs conducted at nearby sites including Neferefres unfinished pyramid.36 He published his findings in the twovolume study Das Grabdenkmal des Knigs Sahure 191013 which remains the standard work on the complex.30 In 1994 the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities opened the Abusir necropolis to tourism. In preparation restorative works were conducted at Sahures pyramid.37 The archeologist Zahi Hawass had a segment of Sahures causeway cleaned and reconstructed during which large reliefdecorated limestone blocks that had been buried in the sand were uncovered.38 The reliefs found on these blocks were thematically and artistically unique38 and shed new light on the decorative programme of the complex.37 Mortuary complexedit Layoutedit Layout of the mortuary complex excluding the valley temple. In order A main pyramid B cult pyramid C enclosure wall D mortuary temple and E causeway39 Old Kingdom mortuary complexes typically consist of five main components 1 a valley temple 2 a causeway 3 a mortuary temple 4 a cult pyramid and 5 the main pyramid.40 Sahures eastwest oriented complex contains all of these elements.3 Its 47 m 154 ft 90 cu tall main pyramid comprised six ascending steps of stone encased in fine white limestone341 with a cult pyramid located at the southeast corner42 and a mortuary temple the standardbearer for future variants3 adjacent to its east face.43 These connected to the valley temple situated on Abusir lake2444 by a 235 m 771 ft 448 cu long limestone causeway.2445 From the outset of the Fifth Dynasty the main pyramids were dramatically reduced in size and adopted simplified construction techniques.4647 Meanwhile relief decoration advanced in wealth of subject matter and quality of workmanship2048 and temples were outfitted with expansive storeroom complexes.4950 Except for minor deviations the complex built by Sahure became the model for the remainder of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties51 and the arrangement of the apartments of his mortuary temple became the standard for subsequent temples of the type in the Old Kingdom.52 Thereby it marked a milestone in the development of pyramid complex construction.51 The complex is welldecorated containing thematically diverse reliefwork identified by the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner as the highest level of the genre found in the Old Kingdom.20 Across its entirety it is estimated that 10000 m2 110000 sq ft of finely carved relief adorned the walls.353 His mortuary temple alone contained 370 running metres 1214 running feet of relief decorations. By contrast Sneferus mortuary temple contained 64 running metres 210 running feet of relief decoration Khufus contained 100 running metres 328 running feet and the temple of Sahures direct predecessor Userkaf contained 120 running metres 394 running feet. The mortuary temple of Pepi II the last king of the Old Kingdom contained 200 running metres 656 running feet of relief decoration indicating a decline after Sahure too.4954 No more than 150 m2 1600 sq ft of fragmentary relief has been preserved from Sahures temple32 but this is considered wellpreserved.55 Additionally Sahure reserved 916 m2 9860 sq ft of the mortuary temples 4246 m2 45700 sq ft floorplan for storerooms accounting for 
21.6  of its total area. By comparison the 800 m2 8600 sq ft temple of Sneferus Red Pyramid at Dahshur and 2000 m2 22000 sq ft temple of Khufus Great Pyramid had no storerooms while the 1265 m2 13620 sq ft temple of Khafres pyramid reserved less than 200 m2 2200 sq ft of space for storerooms accounting for 
15.8  of its total area. This change represents a shift in priority towards the daily activities of the mortuary cult.56 Main pyramidedit Sahures pyramid is situated upon a hill elevated 20 m 66 ft above the Nile valley. Although the subsoil of the area has never been investigated evidence from the nearby mastaba of Ptahshepses suggests that the pyramid was not embedded into bedrock but on a platform constructed from at least two layers of limestone.37 The pyramid had a core comprising six ascending steps57 five of which remain.58 The steps were probably built from horizontally laid courses of limestone.
57 c The core consisted of lowgrade roughly cut limestone57 bound with mud mortar4 and was encased by fine white limestone.57 The pyramid was constructed in a drastically different manner to those of the preceding dynasty. Its outer faces were framed using massive roughly dressed grey limestone blocks well joined with mortar.62 The inner chambers were similarly framed but using considerably smaller blocks.62 The core of the pyramid between the two frames was then packed with a rubble fill of limestone chips pottery shards and sand with clay mortaring.626364 This method while less time and resourceconsuming was careless and unstable and meant that only the outer casing was constructed using highquality limestone.65 The pyramid from the end of the causeway Model of the complex from the Metropolitan Museum of Art Crumbling remains of the pyramid Owing to the poor condition of the monument information about its dimensions and appearance contains a degree of imprecision.66 The pyramid had a base length of about

1.5 8 m 
5.2  ft too far east. Consequently it is not square.57 A ditch was left in the pyramids north face during construction which allowed workers to build the inner corridor and chambers while the core was being erected around it before filling it in with rubble.2467 The pyramid is surrounded by a limestone paved courtyard except where the mortuary temple sits and is accessed from the temples north and south wings.68 Enclosing the courtyard is a tall rounded enclosure wall

Beige fine Tura limestone red red granite light grey lowgrade limestone medium grey limestone foundation dark grey bedrock.70 The substructure access is located slightly above ground on the pyramids north face.57 A short descending corridor  lined with granite24  leads into a vestibule beyond which the route is guarded by a pink granite portcullis57 with granitelined walls on either side.71 The corridor is 
4.2 5 m 14 ft long sloped at 24 48 with a passage

22.3  m 73 ft long with a slope of 5 while the horizontal section is 
3.1  m 10 ft long.74 Precise reconstruction of the substructure plan has been rendered impossible by the extensive damage that stone thieves wrought on the chambers.43 Until 2019 sources differed as to whether the funerary apartment  estimated to be 
12.6  m 41 ft eastwest by 
3.1 5 m 
10.3  ft northsouth3  consisted of a single2471 or twin chambers.43 Clearance of the substructure in 2019 confirmed that the funerary apartment consisted of two rooms with the burial chamber still to be investigated.75 The antechamber lies on the vertical axis of the pyramid occupying 
14.9  m2 160 sq ft of space with the burial chamber to its west.4375 The chambers had a ceiling constructed from three gabled layers of limestone blocks2443 which dispersed the weight from the superstructure onto either side of the passageway preventing collapse.76 Perring estimated the largest blocks to be 
10.6  m 35 ft 
20.2  cu long 3 m 
9.8  ft 
5.7  cu wide and 4 m 13 ft 
7.6  cu thick. Despite their size and weight all but two have been broken.71 Inside the apartments ruins Perring found stone fragments  the only discovered remains of the burial24  which he believed belonged to the kings basalt sarcophagus.43 Entryway into the pyramid substructure Limestone gable of the chamber ceiling Valley templeedit Sahures nowruined valley temple was situated on the shore of Abusir lake on the edge of the desert.244477 It had a rectangular ground plan 32 m 105 ft 61 cu long by 24 m 79 ft 46 cu wide and oriented on the northsouth axis.78 Its base is now around 5 m 16 ft below ground level79 which has risen over the millennia due to the accumulation of silt deposits during the annual Nile flood.44 The temples walls slope inwards as they rise their corners are formed into a convex torus mould up to a cavetto cornice with its own horizontal torus mould.80 The temple had two entrances.81 Its main entrance in the east consisted of a landing ramp leading to a columnadorned portico.244481 Its floor was paved with polished basalt its walls had a red granite dado above which was limestone decorated with basrelief and it had a limestone ceiling that had been painted blue and decorated with reliefcarved golden stars  representing the entrance into the Duat.248144 The columns were formed into date palms with leaves tied vertically to form capitals and each column bore the kings titulary and name carved into the stone and painted green.81 An alternative entrance was built on the south side accessed by a canal leading to a ramp up to another columned portico this time containing four red granite columns.2444 The columns in contrast were cylindrical in form and lacked any crown. This portico was also less deep and was paved with limestone.81 It remains unclear why this entrance was built.82 The wall may belong to Sahures pyramid town named The soul of Sahure comes forth in glory.24 Layout of the valley temple83 Ruined side entrance The entrances were connected by passages to a Tshaped hall equipped with two columns.4481 Borchardt describes the room as twotiered doppelt gestaffelt. It has a transverse space with a narrowed recess in its rear wall containing the two columns the top steps of the two tiers then an even narrower recess in the firsts rear wall the bottom steps of the two tiers.84 The room was originally adorned with polychromatic relief44 and contained a scene depicting the king as a sphinx or griffin trampling captive Near Eastern and Libyan enemies led to him by the gods.812484 The room connects to two more rooms a room with a staircase up to the roof terrace at the south end and causeway at its rearmost recess.2485 A relief depiction of troops from Sahures valley temple can be contrasted with similar imagery in Userkafs complex. In Sahures scene the soldiers are carved with near identical postures a stark contrast to Userkafs confused arrangement of overlapping figures. The latter has greater dynamism inducing more interest whilst the former is more readily understood. The monotony of Sahures scene was balanced by craftsmen introducing detail in the musculature and facial features of the figures.86 Causewayedit A 235 m 771 ft 448 cu long slightly inclined87 limestone causeway45 connected the valley temple to the mortuary temple.24 The causeway was roofed with narrow slits left in the ceiling slabs allowing light to enter illuminating its walls covered in polychromatic basrelief.88 These included scenes with seemingly apotropaic functions such as a scene of the king represented as a sphinx crushing Egypts enemies under his paw.44 Other scenes presented include offering bearers animal slaughter89 and the transport of the gilded pyramidion to the construction site.3843 Only the base of the causeway made of large limestone blocks has been preserved.44 Crosssection of the causeway The scene depicting emaciated nomads reduced through starvation to skin and bone  had important historical implications.38 The scene was thought only to exist in Unas causeway and was thus believed to be unique eyewitness testimony to the declining living standards of Saharan nomads brought about by the end of the Sahara wet phase in the middle of the 
3 rd millennium BC.3890 The discovery of an identical scene in Sahures causeway casts doubt onto this hypothesis.90 Instead Miroslav Verner suggests that the nomads might have been brought into the pyramid town to demonstrate the hardships faced by builders bringing higherquality stone from remote mountain areas.38 A second discovered scene has implications for Fifth Dynasty genealogy.d In this scene Sahure is surrounded by his family in the palace garden Extolled is Sahures beauty WtsnfrwShwr. The image confirms the identity of Sahures consort Meretnebty and his twin sons Ranefer and Netjerirenre. Ranefer who is depicted closer to Sahure and bears the titles kings son and chief lectorpriest may have been Sahures eldest son ascending to the throne as Neferirkare Kakai. Netjerirenre may be the ephemeral ruler Shepseskare who took the throne after Neferefres early death.1
01 e Causeway leading to the mortuary temple Captured enemies being marched to the temple Another important relief discovered depicts a procession of ships led by the king being moored at an unidentified location. The relief originated on the causeway south wall and although the location depicted cannot be identified a corresponding relief on the same wall depicts the king his mother and wife awaiting the arrival of ships carrying myriad goods from the land of Punt  particular emphasis was placed on the Commiphora myrrha trees nht n ntw.108 Sahures is the earliest recorded voyage taken by the Egyptians to Punt109 acquiring myrrh electrum and wood from there.110 Sahure is further depicted extracting myrrh with an adze from the tree in one scene and banqueting with his family including his sons and officials near the tree in another.111 The trees depicted may not be Commiphora myrrha as the use of an adze to extract resin was typically reserved for the Boswellia tree and moreover the colour of the resin in Sahures scene was identified by the Egyptologist Tarek ElAwady as yellowish brown like Boswellia frankincense and not red like myrrh.112 Mortuary templeedit Sahure depicted on a painted wall fragment from his mortuary temple Layout of Sahures mortuary temple. In order 1 entrance hall 2 corridor 3 courtyard 4 storage galleries 5 offering hall 6 main pyramid 7 cult pyramid enclosure 8 side entrance 9 statue chapel 10 transverse corridor39 The mortuary temple was an expansive rectangular building positioned along the eastwest axis45 and situated on a level surface built from two layers of limestone blocks in front of the main pyramids east face.43113 The outer faade was inclined at 82 up to a cavetto cornice with torus mould.114 In its layout Sahures mortuary temple represented the conceptual beginning of all subsequent such temples of the Old Kingdom.3115 It contained five basic elements exemplified in the temple of Khafre an entrance hall an open courtyard a fiveniche statue chapel an offering hall and storerooms.457781 The dominant building material used in its construction here as elsewhere was limestone but substantial valuable materials such as red and black granite alabaster and basalt were also incorporated.43 Entrance halledit The transition between causeway and temple was marked by a large granite gate leading into the mortuary temples entrance hall.58116 In the Fifth Dynasty it was of the standard size of 21 m 69 ft 40 cu long 
5.2 5 m 
17.2  ft 
10.0 2 cu wide and 
6.8  m 22 ft 
13.0  cu tall.117 The hall has suffered considerably rendering a precise reconstruction impracticable.118 It had a limestone floor its walls had red granite dado above which was probably limestone decorated with painted basrelief scenes43119 and it was covered by a stone barrel vault ceiling which had slits in its tympanum allowing the enclosure to be dimly lit.117 Contemporary sources identify this room as the prwrw meaning House of the Great Ones43117 and it may be a replica of the hall of the royal palace where nobles were received and certain rituals performed.89 At its end a granite doorway led to a closed corridor surrounding an open courtyard.3113 Corridor and courtyardedit South corridor  containing the hunting relief  in relation to the mortuary temple and main pyramid The corridor was paved with basalt and its walls had a 
1.5 7 m 
5.2  ft 
3.0 0 cu granite dado above which they were decorated with colourful relief.120 On its north wall scenes depict the king fishing and hunting wildfowl while on the south wall the king is depicted hunting  antelopes gazelles deer and other horned animals are shepherded into an enclosure for the king to shoot with his bow and arrow after which hound dogs seize and kill the animals elsewhere hyenas are observed poaching and hedgehogs and jerboa scatter into their holes121  whilst his courtiers observe.122 A masterful depth of detail has been incorporated into the latter scene which measured 8 m 26 ft long by 3 m 
9.8  ft high.19123 The sedate posture of the kings courtiers representing order is juxtaposed against the mass of wounded and frightened animals depicted in a variety of postures and facing various directions representing chaos.123 The imposing figure that is Sahure is unrivalled in any other example and the gruesome detail of the injured animals is unreplicated. The figure of a hyena pawing at an arrow in its jaw reappears frequently in the Middle and New Kingdom an homage to the relief from Sahures temple.19 Ptahhoteps tomb in Saqqara contains an abridged and slightly less skilfully executed copy of this hunting scene.124 Herded animals being slain by King Sahure or poached by predators The Egyptologist Mark Lehner suggests that the corridor represented the untamed wilderness surrounding a clearing  the open courtyard  of which the king was guarantor.76 From the reliefs depicting ships on the eastcorridor westwall and westcorridor transverse corridor eastwall the Egyptologist Dorothea Arnold contends that the courtyard and corridor form an architectural unit analogous to the Egyptian benben myth. The other reliefs present symbolize the kings role as guarantor of order and prosperity on the sacred island.125 Among the reliefs of this room an important discovery was made. One of the individuals present has been modified to include a brief inscription identifying them as Neferirkare King of Upper and Lower Egypt nswbt Nfrrkr. From this detail Kurt Sethe who was responsible for compiling and preparing the scenes for publication developed the hypothesis that Neferirkare Kakai and Sahure were brothers and that Neferirkare had had the relief corrected after ascending to the throne.126 The open courtyard was paved with polished basalt and lined with sixteen red granite columns supporting the roof of an ambulatory.119 Aside from an alabaster altar in the northwest corner decorated with scenes of sacrifice the open courtyard is bare119 though it originally had statues of the pharaoh placed between the columns127 and may once also have contained statues of kneeling captives.128 Eleven of the original sixteen granite columns were found in the temple.43129 Each was 
6.4  m 21 ft tall129 and carved into the form of date palms symbolising fertility and immortality upon which the kings name and titulary was inscribed43 and painted in green.130 The Two Ladies appear on these columns as well Nekhbet the vulture goddess in the south half representing Upper Egypt and Wadjet the cobra goddess in the north half representing Lower Egypt. Above a red granite architrave bore the royal titulary and further supported the limestone ceiling.131132 The ambulatorys blue painted ceiling was decorated with yellow stars whilst its limestone walls were decorated with polychrome basreliefs fragments of which have been preserved depicting the kings victory over his enemies  on the north wall Near Eastern peoples on the south Libyans  and the acquired spoils.119133 In a particular scene showing the capture of animals supplementary inscriptions identify the quantities seized 123440 head of cattle 223400 asses 232413 deer and 243688 sheep.77119 In another scene the family of a Libyan chief beg for his life to be spared whilst the king prepares to execute him.76119 Under the northern ambulatory a relief of exemplary craftsmanship depicting precious oil vases and Syrian brown bears was found. The figures were given rounded edges so that they simultaneously blend in with the background and stand out clearly. Much of the paint used has been preserved a dark redbrown colour was used for the vase and a yellowbrown for the bears fur.134 Up to a further eleven scenes remain too fragmentary to be reconstructed.119 Basalt paving of the courtyard Remnant of the massive granite architrave inscribed with Sahures titulary Depiction of Sahures mortuary temple as it appeared in the Old Kingdom Palmiform capital of a column Transverse corridor and storage galleriesedit Beyond the courtyard is a transverse northsouth corridor which separates the public outer from the private inner temple76 which only priests were allowed to access.128 The corridor further served as an intersection connecting the outer and inner temples the courtyard surrounding the pyramid and the cult pyramid. At its northern end was a staircase up to the roof terrace.135 Its floor was paved with basalt as the courtyard was and its walls had a granite dado above which was limestone decorated with basrelief.135 On the north half of the corridors east wall is a relief considered by the Egyptologist Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards to be amongst the most interesting in the temple that depicts the king and his court observing the departure of twelve seagoing vessels probably on expedition to Syria or Palestine.121 In the southhalf a similar scene depicts the king and his court awaiting the arrival of ships laden with cargo and several Near Eastern peoples who do not appear to be prisoners indicating either a commercial or perhaps diplomatic mission.121135 In the centre of the west wall of the corridor was an alabaster staircase that led into the fiveniche statue chapel.76135136 Flanking the staircase were two deep niches each containing two granite papyriform columns 
3.6 5 m 12 ft high. The columns supported an architrave a fragment of which has been found in the oil press of St. Jeremiah monastery in Saqqara.135 The niches walls were decorated with reliefs depicting processions of offering bearers and they had recessed side doors leading to twostory storage galleries.76136 The northern gallery consisted of ten rooms arranged in two rows each outfitted with its own staircase  cut directly into the limestone walls50  leading to the second story.136 These held cult objects used for the temple rituals.50 The southern gallery consisted of sixteen or seventeen rooms also arranged in two rows and outfitted with staircases that probably held sacrificial offerings.50136 Reliefs in the corridors leading to the galleries even included ritual instructions such as presentation of gold or sealing a box containing incense found in the north and south corridors respectively.137 Transverse corridor relief depicting a naval expedition The southern storage gallery where offerings were stored Carved stone steps of a twostory storage room Statue chapeledit The transverse corridor staircase leads into the fiveniche statue chapel136 a room with considerable religious importance.128 Accessed through a doubledoor it had a floor paved with white alabaster76 red granite sheathing in the niches and dado fine white limestone sheathed walls elsewhere which was lavishly decorated in relief and a limestone ceiling decorated with stars evoking the night sky of the Duat.135 A small staircase stood before each niche which was once occupied by a statue none of which have been preserved.135 It was originally assumed that each statue represented one of the kings five names but the Abusir Papyri discovered in the nearby pyramid of Neferirkare indicate otherwise. The papyri identify that the central statue represented the king as Osiris while the two outermost ones represented him as the king of Upper Egypt and the king of Lower Egypt.137138 The remaining two are not identified.128 Exiting the chapel to the south is a path leading through two rooms139  including a rectangular vestibule that appears to be a predecessor of the antichambre carre first found in Nyuserres mortuary temple140  passing around a great stone massif and into the westernmost room of the temple the offering hall.138141 Offering hall and auxiliary roomsedit The offering hall of the temple held the most significance for the royal mortuary cult.138 The sanctuary was 
13.7  m 45 ft 26 cu in length and 
4.6  m 15 ft 9 cu wide.136 It was entered through a black granite door that opened up to a white alabaster paved floor and walls with dado of black granite above which was fine white limestone decorated with polychromatic basrelief depicting divinities bringing offerings to the king and covered along its length by a vaulted ceiling with painted stars.138 A low alabaster altar stood at the west wall136 at the foot of a granite false door possibly covered in copper or gold through which the spirit of the king would enter the room to receive his meal before returning to his tomb.142 Unusually the false door has been crudely fashioned and bears none of the names titles or sacrificial formulas that are expected to be found. This led Borchardt to speculate that the door may have originally been sheathed with metal that was eventually stolen by thieves.143 The room also originally contained a black granite statue and an offering basin located in a recessed niche in its southwest corner with an outflow of copper piping.5876 In the north wall a granite doorway gives access to five auxiliary rooms76 which served the offering hall.50 Drainage systemedit Sahures temple had an elaborate drainage system144 including more than 380 m 1247 ft of copper piping.
50 f Rainfall captured on the roof was funnelled out through stone lionhead spouts fit onto the tops of the outer walls. The choice of the lionhead may relate to the ancient Egyptian belief that Set and other inimical deities could manifest themselves in rain. The lion a symbolic protector of sacred ground consumed the harmful spirits and ejected harmless water. Where no roof existed gaps around the base of the outer walls collected the water conducting it out using channels cut into the paving.77144 Water and other liquids used in rituals and ceremonies which had become impure and thus dangerous to touch were removed using the drainage system.5077144 Five stone and copperplated basins each with a lead plug to fit the vent were placed around the inner temple.144 The first was found in the offering hall two more were in the auxiliary rooms beyond it a fourth in the corridor leading up to the offering hall and the fifth in the northern magazine gallery.5076144 These were connected via an intricate network of copper pipes laid beneath the temple which led down the length of the causeway before terminating at an outlet on its southern side.146 Limestone channels through which water and other liquids were drained Lead plug of a copper basin from the mortuary temple Carved limestone channels departing the offering hall Cult pyramidedit By the main pyramids southeast corner confined to a separate enclosure lies a cult pyramid.42 The enclosure is accessed from either the southern end of the transverse corridor50 or through a portico  the side entrance to Sahures mortuary temple147  flanked by two granite columns bearing Sahures royal titulary.76 The portico floor was paved with basalt as were the dado of its walls above which the walls were built of limestone and decorated with polychromatic relief. The reliefs portrayed rows of deities nome and estate personifications and fertility figures  all clutching wassceptres and ankh signs  marching into the temple. An accompanying inscription bears their message to the king We give you all life stability and dominion all joy all offerings all perfect things that are in Upper Egypt since you have appeared as king of Upper and Lower Egypt alive forever.147 Beyond the portico a room with two exits gives access to the transverse corridor in the north or to an oblong room preceding the cult pyramid in the south.148 The cult pyramid had a core ascending in two or three steps50149 composed primarily of limestone block debris framed by yellow limestone blocks and then encased with white limestone blocks  the same method of construction as used in the main pyramid.150 It had a base length of 
15.7  m 52 ft 
30.0  cu converging at 56 towards the apex 
11.6  m 38 ft 
22.1  cu high.7 From the north face151 a bent corridor  initially descending then switching to an ascent  leads into the miniature pyramids sole chamber an eastwest oriented burial room slightly below ground level. The chamber was found void of any content and its walls had been severely damaged by stone thieves.42 The purpose of the cult pyramid remains unclear. Its burial chamber was not used for burials but instead appears to have been a purely symbolic structure.152 It may have hosted the pharaohs ka spirit153 or a miniature statue of the king.154 It may have been used for ritual performances centring on the burial and resurrection of the ka spirit during the Sed festival.154 Remains of the cult pyramid with the lowest course of white limestone still intact Remains of the mortuary temple the side entrance columns to the right of image Granite column of the side entrance reading Sahure given all life health and joy for eternity Deities nome and estate personages and fertility figures marching into the temple Necropolisedit There is a largely unexplored necropolis found through the sideentrance on the transverse corridors southern end. It is thought to be the burial ground of Sahures consort Meretnebty and son Netjerirenre.50 Later historyedit Funerary cultedit The funerary cults at Abusir remained active through the reign of Pepi II at the end of the Sixth Dynasty155 but their continuation beyond this time is a matter of dispute.156 Daily services including offerings made before the false door of the offering hall and at the statues of the chapel were held in the mortuary temple.157 Reliefs on the temples side entrance walls depict processions of individuals with offerings entering into the temple accompanied by detailed instructions for the butchers and porters.158 Sahures funerary domains were also depicted on the reliefs of the causeway. Portrayed are processions of offering bearers bringing foodstuffs and leading animals into the temple. More than 200 funerary domains of Lower Egypt are shown on these blocks accounting for the most extensive record of such funerary domains yet discovered.159 Priests who served Sahures funerary cult include Tepemankh II who also served numerous other kings from Sneferu to Userkaf160161162163 Nikare priest of the cult of Sahure and of the sun temple of Nyuserre164165 Senuankh and Nenkheftka priests of the cults of Userkaf and Sahure166167 Kaemnefret priest in Sahures pyramid and in Neferirkares pyramid and sun temple168 Kuyemsnewy and Kamesenu priests of the cults of Sahure Neferirkare and Nyuserre.169170 Cult of Sekhmetedit Relief fragment depicting the goddess Sekhmet From at least the reign of Thutmose III of the Eighteenth Dynasty171 the south corridor of Sahures mortuary temple121 became home to a cult of Sekhmet.126 The cults early history is unknown. Borchardt suggested that it originated in the Middle Kingdom but there is no evidence to support this conjecture. The earliest attested royal connection to the cult is Thutmose IV172173 of the Eighteenth Dynasty.174 Further attestations include Ay and Horemheb Amenhotep III through a faience object with his name and Seti I and Ramesses II through restoration inscriptions bearing their names.175176 The renewed attention had a negative consequence as it brought on the first wave of dismantlement of the Abusir monuments particularly for the acquisition of valuable Tura limestone. Sahures mortuary temple may have been spared at this time due to the presence of the cult.177 Its influence probably waned after the end of Ramesses IIs reign becoming a site of local worship only.178 The Abusir necropolis and Sahures cult garnered attention again in the TwentyFifth to TwentySixth Dynasties.179 Taharqa had various reliefs replicated  such as images of the king in the form of a sphinx crushing his enemies180  from the mortuary temples of Sahure Nyuserre and Pepi II for the restoration of the temple of Kawa in Nubia.181 The cult of Sekhmet is also mentioned in a graffito found in the temple from Ahmose IIs reign.179 In the late TwentySixth to the early TwentySeventh Dynasty another period of dismantlement appears to have been visited on the monuments. Sahures was again spared protected by the cult into the Ptolemaic Kingdom though it had very reduced influence at this time.182 A third wave of dismantlement of the Abusir monuments is attested in the Roman period by the abundant remains of millstones lime production facilities and worker shelters.183 At the beginning of the Christian era Copts founded a shrine in the temple126 as shown by pottery and Coptic graffiti dating to between the 
4 th and 
7 th centuries AD.184 Periodic farming of the monuments for limestone continued at least until the end of the 
19 th century.185 See alsoedit List of Egyptian pyramids Notesedit  Proposed dates for Sahures reign c.25062492 BC1011 c.24912477 BC12 c.24872475 BC1314 c.24582446 BC1516 c.23852373 BC.17 Radiocarbon dating conducted on shortlived plant remains from the Old Kingdom paired with historical information and Bayesian modelling positioned Sahures accession to between 2542 and 2460 BC with a 95 credible interval and between 2524 and 2482 BC with a 68 credible interval.18  A description by Dorothea Arnold former head of the Department of Egyptian Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art The remorseless precision with which these injuries are described was never equaled in Egyptian art. The kings striding figure seen on the blocks on the left towers over the victims not only in height but also by virtue of its aura of physical strength and royal bearing.19 A statement by Miroslav Verner director of the Czech archaeological excavations at Abusir At the same time the relief decoration ... is so rich in subject matter artistic conception and quality of workmanship that it represents the highest level of the genre that has yet been discovered from the Old Kingdom.20 The foremost excavator of Sahures pyramid Ludwig Borchardt concluded his remarks on the Jagd Hunt with Sowohl mit seiner Gesamtkomposition wie in der sicheren und gewandten Zeichnung der Einzeltypen steht also der Knstler des Jagdbildes aus dem SaureTempel jedenfalls an der Spitze. translated as Thus the artist of the hunting scene from the Sahure temple stands at the top of his profession due to the overall composition as well as due to the secure and elegant drawing of single types.21  Borchardt who conducted the excavations at Sahures pyramid described the pyramid core as composed of accretion layers.5960 This was challenged by Vito Maragioglio and Celeste Rinaldi who conducted careful examinations of pyramidal architecture in the Old Kingdom and failed to find blocks lying on a slant in any Fourth or Fifth Dynasty pyramid they studied. Rather they found that in each instance these blocks were always set horizontally leading them to reject the accretion layer hypothesis.59 The theory was effectively disproven by the Czech excavation team at Abusir led by Miroslav Verner5960 whereupon investigating Neferefres unfinished pyramid they discovered four or five horizontally layered courses of limestone blocks and an inner line of blocks framing the inner chambers.61  Deciphering the origins and genealogy of the Fifth Dynasty has been a complex problem for historians due to the dearth and ambiguity of available historical sources.91 In the Westcar Papyrus the first three kings of the Fifth Dynasty  Userkaf Sahure and Neferirkare  are described as brothers born of the union of Re and Redjedet the wife of a priest of Re in Sakhebu.919293 The relationship between the founder of the Fifth Dynasty Userkaf and his predecessors is unclear.94 He is traditionally viewed as the son of Neferhetepes9596 and thus a grandson of Djedefre.95 Userkafs wife is believed to be Khentkaus I daughter of Menkaure97 and mother of the two kings of Upper and Lower Egypt Sahure and Neferirkare.9899 Sahure thus appears to have been succeeded by his brother1493100 instead of his eldest son Netjerirenre.10 Neferirkare had two sons with Khentkaus II mother of two kings of Upper and Lower Egypt Neferefre and Nyuserre.98 The identity of an ephemeral ruler Shepseskare is unknown but his reign is placed between either Neferirkare and Neferefre93 or Neferefre and Nyuserre.10  Miroslav Verner and Miroslav Brta suggest the following lineage for the Fifth Dynasty Khentkaus I with an unknown partner has two sons Shepseskaf and Userkaf.102103 Userkaf with his consort Neferhetepes has a son Sahure.101104 Sahure with his consort Meretnebty has twin sons Ranefer probably Neferirkare and Netjerirenre.101103105 Neferirkare with his consort Khentkaus II has two sons Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini.103105 The identity of Shepseskare remains unclear though he may plausibly have been Netjerirenre101106 or a son of Neferefre with a wife Khentkaus III whose tomb was found south of Neferefres mortuary temple.107  A section of piping recovered during Borchardts investigations was tested by Dr. Rathgen. It had a composition of 
96.4 7 copper 
0.1 8 iron 
3.3 5 chlorine oxygen etc and traces of arsenic.145 Referencesedit  a b c d e Verner 20
