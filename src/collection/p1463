13 th century BC between the Egyptian Empire led by pharaoh Ramesses II and the Hittite Empire led by king Muwatalli II. Their armies engaged each other at the Orontes River just upstream of Lake Homs and near the archaeological site of Kadesh along what is today the LebanonSyria border.13 It is generally dated to May 1274 BC as accounted by Egyptian chronology14 and is the earliest pitched battle in recorded history for which details of tactics and formations are known. It is believed to be the largest battle ever fought involving chariots a total of 5000 to 60
00.1 51617 After being outmaneuvered ambushed and surrounded in the critical moment Ramesses personally led his body guard to charge the Hittite ranks and broke through to stem the tide of disaster. Backgroundedit After expelling the Hyksos 
15 th Dynasty around 1550 BC the Egyptian New Kingdom rulers became more aggressive in reclaiming control of their states borders. Thutmose I Thutmose III and his son and coregent Amenhotep II fought battles from Megiddo north to the Orontes River including conflict with Kadesh.citation needed Many of the Egyptian campaign accounts between c. 1400 and 1300 BC reflect the general destabilization of the Djahy region southern Canaan. The reigns of Thutmose IV and Amenhotep III were undistinguished except that Egypt continued to lose territory to the Mitanni in northern Syria.citation needed During the late Eighteenth Dynasty the Amarna letters tell the story of the decline of Egyptian influence in the region. The Egyptians showed flagging interest here until almost the end of the dynasty.18 Horemheb d. 1292 BC the last ruler of this dynasty campaigned in this region finally beginning to turn Egyptian interest back to the area.citation needed This process continued in the Nineteenth Dynasty. Like his father Ramesses I Seti I was a military commander who set out to restore Egypts empire to the days of the Tuthmosid kings almost a century before. Inscriptions on the Karnak walls record the details of his campaigns into Canaan and ancient Syria.19 He took 20000 men and reoccupied abandoned Egyptian posts and garrisoned cities. He made an informal peace with the Hittites took control of coastal areas along the Mediterranean Sea and continued to campaign in Canaan. A second campaign led to his capture of Kadesh where a stela commemorated his victory and the Amurru kingdom. His son and heir Ramesses II campaigned with him. There are historical records that record a large weapons order by Ramesses II in the year before the expedition he led to Kadesh in his fifth regnal year.citation needed However at some point both regions may have lapsed back under Hittite control. What exactly happened to Amurru is disputed. Hittitologist Trevor R. Bryce suggests that although it may have fallen once again under Hittite control it is more likely Amurru remained a Hittite vassal state.20 The immediate antecedents to the Battle of Kadesh were the early campaigns of Ramesses II into Canaan. In the fourth year of his reign he marched north into Syria either to recapture Amurru21 or as a probing effort to confirm his vassals loyalty and explore the terrain of possible battles.20 In the spring of the fifth year of his reign in May 1274 BC Ramesses II launched a campaign from his capital PiRamesses modern Qantir. The army moved beyond the fortress of Tjel and along the coast leading to Gaza.22 The recovery of Amurru was Muwatalli IIs stated motivation for marching south to confront the Egyptians. Contending forcesedit The Egyptian Empire under Ramesses II green bordering on the Hittite Empire red at the height of its power in c. 1279 BC. Ramesses led an army of four divisions Amun Re pRe Set and the apparently newlyformed Ptah division.23 There was also a poorly documented troop called the nrrn Nearin or Nearin possibly Canaanite military mercenaries with Egyptian allegiance24 or even Egyptians25 that Ramesses II had left in Amurru apparently in order to secure the port of Sumur.citation needed This division would come to play a critical role in the battle. Also significant was the presence of Sherden troops within the Egyptian army. This is the first time they appear as Egyptian mercenaries and they would play an increasingly significant role in Late Bronze Age history ultimately appearing among the Sea Peoples that ravaged the east Mediterranean at the end of the Bronze Age. Healy in Armies of the Pharaohs observes It is not possible to be precise about the size of the Egyptian chariot force at Kadesh though it could not have numbered less than 2000 vehicles spread through the corps of Amun PRe Ptah and Sutekh assuming that approx. 500 machines were allocated to each corps. To this we may need to add those of the Nearin for if they were not native Egyptian troops their number may not have been formed from chariots detached from the army corps.26 On the Hittite side King Muwatalli II had mustered several of his allies among them Rimisharrinaa the king of Aleppo. Ramesses II recorded a long list of 19 Hittite allies brought to Kadesh by Muwatalli. This list is of considerable interest to Hittitologists as it reflects the extent of Hittite influence at the time. Battleedit Rameses II in the Battle of Khadesh. Muwatalli had positioned his troops behind Old Kadesh but Ramesses was misled by two captured nomads who said the Hittite army was still far off at Aleppo16 but in fact the nomads were Hittite spies sent to mislead the pharoah. Remesses ordered his forces to set up camp and he marched hastily towards Kadesh completely unaware of the large enemy force waiting for him.27 Ramesses II describes his arrival on the battlefield in the two principal inscriptions concerning the battle the socalled Poem and the Bulletin From the Poem Now then his majesty had prepared his infantry his chariotry and the Sherden of his majestys capturing... in the Year 5 
2 nd month of the third season day 9 his majesty passed the fortress of Sile. and entered Canaan ... His infantry went on the narrow passes as if on the highways of Egypt. Now after days had passed after this then his majesty was in Ramses MeriAmon the town which is in the Valley of the Cedar. His majesty proceeded northward. After his majesty reached the mountain range of Kadesh then his majesty went forward... and he crossed the ford of the Orontes with the first division of Amon named He Gives Victory to UsermaatRe SetepenRe. His majesty reached the town of Kadesh... The division of Amon was on the march behind him the division of Re was crossing the ford in a district south of the town of Shabtuna at the distance of one iter from the place where his majesty was the division of Ptah was on the south of the town of Arnaim the division of Set was marching on the road. His majesty had formed the first ranks of battle of all the leaders of his army while they were still on the shore in the land of Amurru. From the Bulletin Year 5 
3 rd month of the third season day 9 under the majesty of Ramesses II... The lord proceeded northward and his majesty arrived at a vicinity south of the town of Shabtuna.28 Shasu spies shown being beaten by the Egyptians. As Ramesses and the Egyptian advance guard were about 11 kilometers from Kadesh south of Shabtuna he met two Shasu nomads who told him that the Hittite king was in the land of Aleppo on the north of Tunip 200 kilometers away where the Shasu said he was too much afraid of Pharaoh L.P.H. to come south.29 This was state the Egyptian texts a false report ordered by the Hittites with the aim of preventing the army of His Majesty from drawing up to combat with the foe of Hatti.29 An Egyptian scout then arrived at the camp bringing two Hittite prisoners. The prisoners revealed that the entire Hittite army and the Hittite king were actually close at hand When they had been brought before Pharaoh His Majesty asked Who are you They replied We belong to the king of Hatti. He has sent us to spy on you. Then His Majesty said to them Where is he the enemy from Hatti I had heard that he was in the land of Aleppo. They of Tunip replied to His Majesty Lo the king of Hatti has already arrived together with the many countries who are supporting him... They are armed with their infantry and their chariots. They have their weapons of war at the ready. They are more numerous than the grains of sand on the beach. Behold they stand equipped and ready for battle behind the old city of Kadesh.30 The Hittite chariots attack the Ra division. After this Ramesses II called his princes to meet with him and discuss the fault of his governors and officials in not informing the position of Muwatalli II and his army. As Ramesses was alone with his bodyguard and the Amun division the vizier was ordered to hasten the arrival of the Ptah and Seth divisions with the Re division having almost arrived at the camp.31 While Ramesses was talking with the princes and ordering the Amun division to prepare for battle the Hittite chariots crossed the river and charged the middle of the Ra division as they were making their way toward Ramesses position. The Ra division was caught in the open and scattered in all directions. Some fled northward to the Amun camp all the while being pursued by Hittite chariots. The Hittite chariotry then rounded north and attacked the Egyptian camp crashing through the Amun shield wall and creating panic among the Amun division. However the momentum of the Hittite attack was already starting to wane as the chariots were impeded by the obstacles of such a large camp some were killed in chariot crashes.32 In the Egyptian account Ramesses describes himself as being deserted and surrounded by enemies No officer was with me no charioteer no soldier of the army no shieldbearer.33 Ramesses was able to defeat his initial attackers and to return to the Egyptian lines I was before them like Set in his moment. I found the mass of chariots in whose midst I was scattering them before my horses. The pharaoh now facing a desperate fight for his life called upon his god Amun and faced the enemy. Ramesses personally led several charges into the Hittite ranks with his personal guard beside him some chariots from his Amun division and survivors from the routed Re division.32 Ramesses counterattacks. The Hittites who believed their enemies to be totally routed had stopped to plunder the Egyptian camp and so became easy targets for Ramessess counterattack. He drove the looters back towards the Orontes River and away from the Egyptian camp34 and in the ensuing pursuit the heavy Hittite chariots were easily overtaken and dispatched by the lighter faster Egyptian chariots.16 Final phase of the battle. Although he had suffered a significant reversal Muwatalli II still commanded a large force of reserve chariotry and infantry as well as the walls of the town. As the retreat reached the river he ordered another thousand chariots to counterattack led by the high nobles close to the king. As the Hittite forces approached the Egyptian camp again the Nearin troop contingent from Amurru suddenly arrived surprising the Hittites. Finally the Ptah division arrived from the south threatening the Hittite rear.35 After six charges the Hittite forces were almost surrounded and the survivors were pinned against the Orontes.36 The remaining Hittite elements which had not been overtaken in the withdrawal were forced to abandon their chariots and attempt to swim the river as fast as crocodiles according to Egyptian accounts and many drowned.37 There is no consensus about the overall outcome with views ranging from an Egyptian victory to a draw38 or in the view of Iranian Egyptologist Mehdi Yarahmadi an Egyptian defeat with the Egyptian accounts being simply propaganda.39 The Hittite army was ultimately forced to retreat but the Egyptians could not capture Kadesh.35 Battle scene from the Great Kadesh reliefs of Ramses II on the walls of the Ramesseum The original relief from the Ramesseum Aftermathedit Main article EgyptianHittite peace treaty The Siege of Dapur Logistically unable to support a long siege of the walled city of Kadesh3 Ramesses gathered his troops and retreated south towards Damascus and ultimately back to Egypt. Ramesses proclaimed he had routed his enemies but he had not even attempted to capture Kadesh.2 However the battle was a personal triumph for Ramesses since after blundering into the chariot ambush and facing defeat and death the young king had managed to rally his scattered troops and saved the day. His new lighter and faster twoman chariots had shown their superiority in catching the slower threeman Hittite chariots from behind.3 Hittite records from Hattusa however tell of a very different conclusion to the greater campaign in which a chastened Ramesses was forced to depart from Kadesh in defeat. Modern historians conclude that the battle ended in a draw from a practical point of view but was a turning point for the Egyptians who had developed new technologies and rearmed to pushing back against the years of incursions by the Hittites.3 The EgyptianHittite peace treaty on display at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum is believed to be the earliest example of any written international agreement of any kind.
3 unreliable source The Hittite king Muwatalli II continued to campaign as far south as the Egyptian province of Upi Apa which he captured and placed under the control of his brother Hattusili the future Hattusili III.40 Egypts sphere of influence in Asia was now restricted to Canaan.40 Even that was threatened for a time by revolts among Egypts vassal states in the Levant and Ramesses was compelled to embark on a series of campaigns to uphold his authority in Canaan before he could again attack the Hittites.citation needed In the eighth and ninth years of his reign Ramesses extended his military successes. This time he successfully captured the Hittiteruled cities of Dapur and Tunip41 where no Egyptian soldier had been seen since the time of Thutmose III almost 120 years earlier. Ramessess victory proved ephemeral however. The thin strip of territory pinched between Amurru and Kadesh was not a defensible possession. Within a year it had returned to Hittite control and Ramesses had to march against Dapur once more in his tenth year. His second success was just as meaningless since neither Egypt nor Hatti could decisively defeat the other in the region.36 An official peace treaty with the new Hittite king Hattusili III3 was signed some 15 years after the Battle of Kadesh in the 
21 st year of Ramesses IIs reign 1258 BC which finally concluded the borderland conflicts. The treaty was inscribed on a silver tablet of which a clay copy was found in the Hittite capital Hattusa now in Turkey and is on display at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum. A large replica hangs on a wall at the headquarters of the United Nations as the earliest international peace treaty known to historians.3 Its text in the Hittite version appears in the links below. An Egyptian version survives on papyrus.citation needed Documentationedit Main article Kadesh inscriptions There is more evidence in the form of texts and wall reliefs for this battle than for any other in the Ancient Near East but almost all of it is from an Egyptian perspective. Indeed the first scholarly report on the battle by James Henry Breasted in 1903 praised the sources that allowed the reconstruction of the battle with certainty.42 However some historians argue that the battle was a draw at best and that Egyptian influence over Amurru and Qadesh seems to have been lost forever.43 The main source of information is in the Egyptian record of the battle for which a general level of accuracy is assumed despite factual errors and propaganda.44 The bombastic nature of Ramesses version has long been recognized.45 The Egyptian version of the battle is recorded in two primary forms known as the Poem and the Bulletin. The Poem has been questioned as actual verse as opposed to a prose account similar to that recorded by other pharaohs. Likewise the Bulletin is simply a lengthy caption accompanying the reliefs.46 The inscriptions are repeated multiple times seven for the Bulletin and eight for the Poem in temples in Abydos Temple of Luxor Karnak Abu Simbel and the Ramesseum.47 In addition to these lengthy narratives numerous small captions point out elements of the battle. Besides the inscriptions there are textual occurrences preserved in Papyrus Raifet and Papyrus Sallier III48 and a letter from Ramesses to Hattusili III written in response to a scoffing complaint by Hattusili about the pharaohs claims of victory in the battle.49 Hittite references to the battle including the above letter have been found at Hattusa but no annals have been discovered that might describe it as part of a campaign. Instead there are various references made to it in the context of other events. That is especially true of Hattusili III for whom the battle marked an important milestone in his career.citation needed Hittite alliesedit Sources Goetze A.
