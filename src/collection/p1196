In the Aegyptiaca a history of Egypt written by the GrecoEgyptian priest and historian Manetho in the 
3 rd century BC the term Hyksos is used ethnically to designate people of probable West Semitic Levantine origin.19 While Manetho portrayed the Hyksos as invaders and oppressors this interpretation is questioned in modern Egyptology.10 Instead Hyksos rule might have been preceded by groups of Canaanite peoples who gradually settled in the Nile delta from the end of the Twelfth Dynasty onwards and who may have seceded from the crumbling and unstable Egyptian control at some point during the Thirteenth Dynasty.11 The Hyksos period marks the first in which Egypt was ruled by foreign rulers.12 Many details of their rule such as the true extent of their kingdom and even the names and order of their kings remain uncertain. The Hyksos practiced many Levantine or Canaanite customs as well as many Egyptian customs.13 They have been credited with introducing several technological innovations to Egypt such as the horse and chariot as well as the sickle sword and the composite bow a theory which is disputed.14 The Hyksos did not control all of Egypt. Instead they coexisted with the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Dynasties which were based in Thebes.15 Warfare between the Hyksos and the pharaohs of the late Seventeenth Dynasty eventually culminated in the defeat of the Hyksos by Ahmose I who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.16 In the following centuries the Egyptians would portray the Hyksos as bloodthirsty and oppressive foreign rulers. Nameedit Etymologyedit Hyksos in hieroglyphs qsw  qwswt1718 heqau khasut
4 b Hyksos Rulers of the foreign countries17 Greek Hyksos  Hykussos 21 Standard characters for Hyksos in the label for Abisha the Hyksos in the tomb of Khnumhotep II c. 1900 BC.22 The crook  q means ruler the hill  is a phonetic complement q to  while  stands for foreign country pronounced st plural swt. The sign  marks the plural.22 The term Hyksos is derived via the Greek  Hykss from the Egyptian expression  qswt or qwswt heqau khasut meaning rulers of foreign lands.1718 The Greek form is likely a textual corruption of an earlier  Hykousss.21 The first century AD Jewish historian Josephus gives the name as meaning shepherd kings or captive shepherds in his Contra Apion Against Apion where he describes the Hyksos as Jews as they appeared in the Hellenistic Egyptian historian Manetho.2324 This whole nation was styled Hycsos that is Shepherdkings for the first syllable Hyc according to the sacred dialect denotes a king as is Sos a shepherd. But this according to the ordinary dialect and of these is compounded Hycsos but some say that these people were Arabians.25 Josephuss rendition may arise from a later Egyptian pronunciation of qswt as qsw which was then understood to mean lord of shepherds.26 It is unclear if this translation was found in Manetho an Armenian translation of an epitome of Manetho given by the late antique historian Eusebius gives the correct translation of foreign kings.27 Useedit It is now commonly accepted in academic publications that the term qswt refers only to the individual foreign rulers of the late Second Intermediate Period28 especially of the Fifteenth Dynasty rather than a people. However it was used as an ethnic term by Josephus.c Its use to refer to the population still persists in some academic papers.31 In Ancient Egypt the term Hyksos qswt was also used to refer to various Nubian and especially Asiatic rulers both before and after the Fifteenth Dynasty.43233 It was used at least since the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt c. 23452181 BC to designate chieftains from the SyroPalestine area.22 One of its earliest recorded uses is found c. 1900 BC in the tomb of Khnumhotep II of the Twelfth Dynasty to label a nomad or Canaanite ruler named Abisha the Hyksos using the standard  qswt Heqakasut for Hyksos.334 Scarabs of Hyksos kings Semqen the Hyksos Khyan the Hyksos Scarabs of Hyksos kings with Hyksos highlighted.35 Based on the use of the name in a Hyksos inscription of SakirHar from Avaris the name was used by the Hyksos as a title for themselves.36 However Kim Ryholt argues that Hyksos was not an official title of the rulers of the Fifteenth Dynasty and is never encountered together with royal titulary only appearing as the title in the case of SakirHar. According to Ryholt Hyksos was rather a generic term which is encountered separately from royal titulary and in regnal lists after the end of the Fifteenth Dynasty itself.37 However Vera Mller writes Considering that Skrhr is also mentioned with three names of the traditional Egyptian titulary Horus name Golden Falcon name and Two Ladies name on the same monument this argument is somehow strange.38 Danielle Candelora and Manfred Bietak also argue that the Hyksos used the title officially.639 All other texts in the Egyptian language do not call the Hyksos by this name instead referring to them as Asiatics mw with the possible exception of the Turin King List in a hypothetical reconstruction from a fragment.40 The title is not attested for the Hyksos king Apepi possibly indicating an increased adoption of Egyptian decorum.41 The names of Hyksos rulers in the Turin list are without the royal cartouche and have the throwstick foreigners determinative.42 Scarabs also attest the use of this title for pharaohs usually assigned to the Fourteenth or Sixteenth Dynasty of Egypt who are sometimes called lesser Hyksos.38 The Theban Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt is also given the title in some versions of Manetho a fact which Bietak attributes to textual corruption.41 In the Twentyfifth Dynasty of Egypt and during the Ptolemaic Period the term Hyksos was adopted as a personal title and epithet by several pharaohs or high Egyptian officials including the Theban official Mentuemhat Philip III of Macedon4344 and Ptolemy XIII.44 It was also used on the tomb of Egyptian grand priest Petosiris at Tuna elGebel in 300 BC to designate the Persian ruler Artaxerxes III although it is unknown if Artaxerxes adopted this title for himself.44 Originsedit Ancient historiansedit Blue glazed steatite scarab in a gold mount with the cartouche of Hyksos ruler Khyan  Son of Ra Khyan living forever In his epitome of Manetho Josephus connected the Hyksos with the Jews45 but he also calls them Arabs.23 In their own epitomes of Manetho the Late antique historians Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius say that the Hyksos came from Phoenicia.23 Until the excavation and discovery of Tell ElDaba the site of the Hyksos capital Avaris in 1966 historians relied on these accounts for the Hyksos period.946 Modern historiansedit Material finds at Tell ElDaba indicate that the Hyksos originated in the Levant.9 The Hyksos personal names indicate that they spoke a Western Semitic language and may be called for convenience sake Canaanites.47 A Retjenu associated with the Hyksos in some Egyptian inscriptions.48 Kamose the last king of the Theban Seventeenth Dynasty refers to Apepi as a Chieftain of Retjenu in a stela that implies a Levantine background for this Hyksos king.48 According to AnnaLatifa Mourad the Egyptian application of the term mw to the Hyksos could indicate a range of backgrounds including newly arrived Levantines or people of mixed LevantineEgyptian origin.49 Due to the work of Manfred Bietak which found similarities in architecture ceramics and burial practices scholars currently favor a northern Levantine origin of the Hyksos.50 Based particularly on temple architecture Bietak argues for strong parallels between the religious practices of the Hyksos at Avaris with those of the area around Byblos Ugarit Alalakh and Tell Brak defining the spiritual home of the Hyksos as in northernmost Syria and northern Mesopotamia.51 The connection of the Hyksos to Retjenu also suggests a northern Levantine origin Theoretically it is feasible to deduce that the early Hyksos as the later Apophis were of elite ancestry from Rnw a toponym ... cautiously linked with the Northern Levant and the northern region of the Southern Levant.49 Earlier arguments that the Hyksos names might be Hurrian have been rejected52 while earlytwentiethcentury proposals that the Hyksos were IndoEuropeans fitted European dreams of IndoEuropean supremacy now discredited.53 Some have suggested that Hyksos or a part of them was of Maryannu origins as evident by their use and introduction of chariots and horses into Egypt.5455 However this theory has been too rejected by modern scholarship. A study of dental traits by Nina Maaranen and Sonia Zakrzewski in 2021 on 90 people of Avaris indicated that individuals defined as locals and nonlocals were not ancestrally different from one another. The results were said to be in line with the archaeological evidence suggesting Avaris was an important hub in the Middle Bronze Age eastern Mediterranean trade network welcoming people from beyond its borders.56 Historyedit Early contacts between Egypt and the Levantedit Procession of the Aamu A group of West Asiatic foreigners possibly Canaanites labelled as Aamu mw including the leading man with a Nubian ibex labelled as Abisha the Hyksos  qsw Heqakasut for Hyksos. Tomb of 
12 thdynasty official Khnumhotep II at Beni Hasan c. 1890 BC.122234 Historical records suggest that Semitic people and Egyptians had contacts at all periods of Egypts history.57 The MacGregor plaque an early Egyptian tablet dating to 3000 BC records The first occasion of striking the East with the picture of Pharaoh Den smiting a Western Asiatic enemy.58 During the reign of Senusret II c. 1890 BC parties of Western Asiatic foreigners visiting the Pharaoh with gifts are recorded as in the tomb paintings of 
12 thdynasty official Khnumhotep II. These foreigners possibly Canaanites or nomads are labelled as Aamu mw including the leading man with a Nubian ibex labelled as Abisha the Hyksos  qsw Heqakasut for Hyksos the first known instance of the name Hyksos.122234 Soon after the Sebekkhu Stele dated to the reign of Senusret III reign 18781839 BC records the earliest known Egyptian military campaign in the Levant. The text reads His Majesty proceeded northward to overthrow the Asiatics. His Majesty reached a foreign country of which the name was Sekmem ... Then Sekmem fell together with the wretched Retenu where Sekmem skmm is thought to be Shechem and Retenu or Retjenu are associated with ancient Syria.5960 Background and arrival in Egyptedit The only ancient account of the whole Hyksos period is by the Hellenistic Egyptian historian Manetho who however exists only as quoted by others.61 As recorded by Josephus Manetho describes the beginning of Hyksos rule thusly A people of ignoble origin from the east whose coming was unforeseen had the audacity to invade the country which they mastered by main force without difficulty or even battle. Having overpowered the chiefs they then savagely burnt the cities razed the temples of the gods to the ground and treated the whole native population with the utmost cruelty massacring some and carrying off the wives and children of others into slavery Contra Apion I.75

Inscriptions The perfect god the lord of the two lands Nebkhepeshre Apepi and Follower of his lord Nehemen found at a burial at Saqqara.63 Now at the Luxor Museum.6465 Manethos invasion narrative is nowadays rejected by most scholars.10 It is likely that he was influenced by more recent foreign invasions of Egypt.6 Instead it appears that the establishment of Hyksos rule was mostly peaceful and did not involve an invasion of an entirely foreign population.66 Archaeology shows a continuous Asiatic presence at Avaris for over 150 years before the beginning of Hyksos rule67 with gradual Canaanite settlement beginning there c.1800 BC during the Twelfth Dynasty.18 Strontium isotope analysis of the inhabitants of Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period Avaris also dismissed the invasion model in favor of a migration one. Contrary to the model of a foreign invasion the study didnt find more males moving into the region but instead found a sex bias towards females with a high proportion of 77 of females being nonlocals.6869 Manfred Bietak argues that Hyksos should be understood within a repetitive pattern of the attraction of Egypt for western Asiatic population groups that came in search of a living in the country especially the Delta since prehistoric times.67 He notes that Egypt had long depended on the Levant for expertise in areas of shipbuilding and seafaring with possible depictions of Asiatic shipbuilders being found from reliefs from the Sixth Dynasty ruler Sahure. The Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt is known to have had many Asiatic immigrants serving as soldiers household or temple serfs and various other jobs. Avaris in the Nile Delta attracted many Asiatic immigrants in its role as a hub of international trade and seafaring.70 The final powerful pharaoh of the Egyptian Thirteenth Dynasty was Sobekhotep IV who died around 1725 BC after which Egypt appears to have splintered into various kingdoms including one based at Avaris ruled by the Fourteenth Dynasty.11 Based on their names this dynasty was already primarily of West Asian origin.71 After an event in which their palace was burned71 the Fourteenth Dynasty would be replaced by the Hyksos Fifteenth Dynasty which would establish loose control over northern Egypt by intimidation or force72 thus greatly expanding the area under Avariss control.73 Kim Ryholt argues that the Fifteenth Dynasty invaded and displaced the Fourteenth however Alexander IlinTomich argues that this is not sufficiently substantiated.52 Bietak interprets a stela of Neferhotep III to indicate that Egypt was overrun by roving mercenaries around the time of the Hyksos ascension to power.74 Kingdomedit Main article Fifteenth Dynasty of Egypt Avaris Tjaru Tell elYahudiyeh Heliopolis Tell Basta Tell Farasha Inshas Tell elMaskhuta Tell erRetabeh Tell esSahaba Memphis Lisht Dahshur Beni Hasan classnotpageimage Key Sites of the Second Intermediate Period in Northern Egypt. West Semitic in red Egyptian in blue.citation needed The length of time the Hyksos ruled is unclear. The fragmentary Turin King List says that there were six Hyksos kings who collectively ruled 108 years75 however in 2018 Kim Ryholt proposed a new reading of as many as 149 years while Thomas Schneider proposed a length between 160 and 180 years.76 The rule of the Hyksos overlaps with that of the native Egyptian pharaohs of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Dynasties better known as the Second Intermediate Period. The area under direct control of the Hyksos was probably limited to the eastern Nile delta.15 Their capital city was Avaris at a fork on the nowdry Pelusiac branch of the Nile. Memphis may have also been an important administrative center77 although the nature of any Hyksos presence there remains unclear.15 According to AnnaLatifa Mourad other sites with likely Levantine populations or strong Levantine connections in the Delta include Tell Farasha and Tell elMaghud located between Tell Basta and Avaris78 ElKhatana southwest of Avaris and Inshas.79 The increased prosperity of Avaris may have attracted more Levantines to settle in the eastern Delta.66 Kom elHisn at the edge of the Western Delta shows NearEastern goods but individuals mostly buried in an Egyptian style which Mourad takes to mean that they were most likely Egyptians heavily influenced by Levantine traditions or more likely Egyptianized Levantines.80 The site of Tell Basta Bubastis at the confluence of the Pelusiac and Tanitic branches of the Nile contains monuments to the Hyksos kings Khyan and Apepi but little other evidence of Levantine habitation.81 Tell elHabwa Tjaru located on a branch of the Nile near the Sinai also shows evidence of nonEgyptian presence however the majority of the population appears to have been Egyptian or Egyptianized Levantines.82 Tell ElHabwa would have provided Avaris with grain and trade goods.83 Neareastern inspired diadem with heads of gazelles and a stag between stars or flowers belonging to an elite lady discovered at a tomb at Tell elDaba Avaris dating from the late Hyksos period 16481540 BC.8485 Now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.86 In the Wadi Tumilat Tell elMaskhuta shows a great deal of Levantine pottery and an occupation history closely correlated to the Fifteenth Dynasty87 nearby Tell elRataba and Tell elSahaba show possible Hyksosstyle burials and occupation88 Tell elYahudiyah located between Memphis and the Wadi Tumilat contains a large earthwork that may have been built by the Hyksos as well as evidence of Levantine burials from as early as the Thirteenth Dynasty.89 The Hyksos settlements in the Wadi Tumilat would have provided access to Sinai the southern Levant and possibly the Red Sea.66 The sites Tell elKabir Tell Yehud Tell Fawziya and Tell Geziret elFaras are noted by scholars other than Mourad to contain elements of Hyksos culture but there is no published archaeological material for them.90 The Hyksos claimed to be rulers of both Lower and Upper Egypt however their southern border was marked at Hermopolis and Cusae.13 Some objects might suggest a Hyksos presence in Upper Egypt but they may have been Theban war booty or attest simply to short term raids trade or diplomatic contact.91 The nature of Hyksos control over the region of Thebes remains unclear.15 Most likely Hyksos rule covered the area from Middle Egypt to southern Palestine.92 Older scholarship believed due to the distribution of Hyksos goods with the names of Hyksos rulers in places such as Baghdad and Knossos that Hyksos had ruled a vast empire but it seems more likely to have been the result of diplomatic gift exchange and farflung trade networks.9315 Wars with the Seventeenth Dynastyedit The conflict between Thebes and the Hyksos is known exclusively from proTheban sources and it is difficult to construct a chronology.16 These sources propagandistically portray the conflict as a war of national liberation. This perspective was formerly taken by scholars as well but is no longer thought to be accurate.9495 Hostilities between the Hyksos and the Theban Seventeenth Dynasty appear to have begun during the reign of Theban king Seqenenra Taa. Seqenenra Taas mummy shows that he was killed by several blows of an axe to the head apparently in battle with the Hyksos.96 It is unclear why hostilities may have started but the much later fragmentary New Kingdom tale The Quarrel of Apophis and Seqenenre blames the Hyksos ruler ApepiApophis for initiating the conflict by demanding that Seqenenra Taa remove a pool of hippopotamuses near Thebes.97 However this is a satire on the Egyptian storytelling genre of the kings novel rather than a historical text.96 A contemporary inscription at Wadi el Hl may also refer to hostilities between Seqenenra and Apepi.74 Mummified head of Seqenenra Taa bearing axe wounds. The common theory is that he died in a battle against the Hyksos.97 Three years later c. 1542 BC98 Seqenenra Taas successor Kamose initiated a campaign against several cities loyal to the Hyksos the account of which is preserved on three monumental stelae set up at Karnak.9974100 The first of the three Carnarvon Tablet includes a complaint by Kamose about the divided and occupied state of Egypt To what effect do I perceive it my might while a ruler is in Avaris and another in Kush I sitting joined with an Asiatic and a Nubian each man having his own portion of this Egypt sharing the land with me. There is no passing him as far as Memphis the water of Egypt. He has possession of Hermopolis and no man can rest being deprived by the levies of the Setiu. I shall engage in battle with him and I shall slit his body for my intention is to save Egypt striking the Asiatics.101 Following a common literary device Kamoses advisors are portrayed as trying to dissuade the king but the king attacks anyway.99 He recounts his destruction of the city of Nefrusy as well as several other cities loyal to the Hyksos. On a second stele Kamose claims to have captured Avaris but returned to Thebes after capturing a messenger between Apepi and the king of Kush.96 Kamose appears to have died soon afterward c. 1540 BC.98 Ahmose I continued the war against the Hyksos most likely conquering Memphis Tjaru and Heliopolis early in his reign the latter two of which are mentioned in an entry of the Rhind mathematical papyrus.96 Knowledge of Ahmose Is campaigns against the Hyksos mostly comes from the tomb of Ahmose son of Ebana who gives a first person account claiming that Ahmose I sacked Avaris102 Then there was fighting in Egypt to the south of this town Avaris and I carried off a man as a living captive. I went down into the waterfor he was captured on the city sideand crossed the water carrying him. ... Then Avaris was despoiled and I brought spoil from there.103 Pharaoh Ahmose I ruled c. 15491524 BC slaying a probable Hyksos. Detail of a ceremonial axe in the name of Ahmose I treasure of Queen Ahhotep II. Inscription Ahmose beloved of the War God Montu. Luxor Museum104105106107 Thomas Schneider places the conquest in year 18 of Ahmoses reign.108 However excavations of Tell ElDaba Avaris show no widespread destruction of the city which instead seems to have been abandoned by the Hyksos.96 Manetho as recorded in Josephus states that the Hyksos were allowed to leave after concluding a treaty109 Thoumosis ... invested the walls of Avaris with an army of 480000 men and endeavoured to reduce the Hyksos to submission by siege. Despairing of achieving his object he concluded a treaty under which the Hyksos were all to evacuate Egypt and go whither they would unmolested. Upon these terms no fewer than two hundred and forty thousand entire households with their possessions left Egypt and traversed the desert to Syria. Contra Apion I.8889110 Although Manetho indicates that the Hyksos population was expelled to the Levant there is no archaeological evidence for this and Manfred Bietak argues on the basis of archaeological finds throughout Egypt that it is likely that numerous Asiatics were resettled in other locations in Egypt as artisans and craftsmen.111 Many may have remained at Avaris as pottery and scarabs with typical Hyksos forms continued to be produced uninterrupted throughout the Eastern Delta.74 Canaanite cults also continued to be worshiped at Avaris.112 Following the capture of Avaris Ahmose son of Ebana records that Ahmose I captured Sharuhen possibly Tell elAjjul which some scholars argue was a city in Canaan under Hyksos control.113 Rule and administrationedit An official wearing the mushroomheaded hairstyle also seen in contemporary paintings of Western Asiatic foreigners such as in the tomb of Khnumhotep II at Beni Hasan.

Staatliche Sammlung fr gyptische Kunst.114115116117 Administrationedit The Hyksos show a mix of Egyptian and Levantine cultural traits.13 Their rulers adopted the full Ancient Egyptian royal titulary and employed Egyptian scribes and officials.118 They also used NearEastern forms of administration such as employing a chancellor imyr khetemet as the head of their administration.119 Rulersedit The names the order length of rule and even the total number of the Fifteenth Dynasty rulers are not known with full certainty. After the end of their rule the Hyksos kings were not considered to have been legitimate rulers of Egypt and were therefore omitted from most king lists.120 The fragmentary Turin King List included six Hyksos kings however only the name of the last Khamudi is preserved.121 Six names are also preserved in the various epitomes of Manetho however it is difficult to reconcile the Turin King List and other sources with names known from Manetho122 largely due to the corrupted name forms in Manetho.6 The name ApepiApophis appears in multiple sources however.123 Various other archaeological sources also provide names of rulers with the Hyksos title124 however the majority of kings from the second intermediate period are attested once on a single object with only three exceptions.125 Ryholt associates two other rulers known from inscriptions with the dynasty Khyan and SakirHar.126 The name of Khyans son Yanassi is also preserved from Tell ElDaba.73 The two best attested kings are Khyan and Apepi.127 Scholars generally agree that Apepi and Khamudi are the last two kings of the dynasty128 and Apepi is attested as a contemporary of SeventeenthDynasty pharaohs Kamose and Ahmose I.129 Ryholt has proposed that Yanassi did not rule and that Khyan directly preceded Apepi130 but most scholars agree that the order of kings is Khyan Yanassi Apepi Khamudi.131 There is less agreement on the early rulers. SakirHar is proposed by Schneider Ryholt and Bietak to have been the first king.70132133 Recently archaeological finds have suggested that Khyan may actually have been a contemporary of ThirteenthDynasty pharaoh Sobekhotep IV potentially making him an early rather than a late Hyksos ruler.134 This has prompted attempts to reconsider the entire chronology of the Hyksos period which as of 2018 had not yet reached any consensus.135 Some kings are attested from either fragments of the Turin King List or from other sources who may have been Hyksos rulers. According to Ryholt kings Semqen and Aperanat known from the Turin King List may have been early Hyksos rulers136 however Jrgen von Beckerath assigns these kings to the Sixteenth Dynasty of Egypt.137 Another king known from scarabs Sheshi122 is believed by many scholars to be a Hyksos king138 however Ryholt assigns this king to the Fourteenth Dynasty of Egypt.139 Manfred Bietak proposes that a king recorded as YaqubHar may also have been a Hyksos king of the Fifteenth Dynasty.41 Bietak suggests that many of the other kings attested on scarabs may have been vassal kings of the Hyksos.140 Hyksos rulers in various sources70132141 Manetho142 Turin King List Genealogy of Ankhefensekhmet Identification by Redford 1992143 Identification by Ryholt 1997144 Identification by Bietak 201270 Identification by Schneider 2006 reconstructed Semitic name in parentheses1411

Hyksos diplomacy with Crete and ancient Near East is also confirmed by the presence of gifts from the Hyksos court in those places.70 Khyan one of the Hyksos rulers is known for his wideranging contacts as objects in his name have been found at Knossos and Hattusha indicating diplomatic contacts with Crete and the Hittites and a sphinx with his name was bought on the art market at Baghdad and might demonstrate diplomatic contacts with Babylon possibly with the first Kassites ruler Gandash.150151 The Theban rulers of the Seventeenth Dynasty are known to have imitated the Hyksos both in their architecture and regnal names.152 There is evidence of friendly relations between the Hyksos and Thebes including possibly a marriage alliance prior to the reign of the Theban pharaoh Seqenenra Taa.97 An intercepted letter between Apepi and the Nubian King of Kerma also called Kush to the south of Egypt recorded on the Carnarvon Tablet has been interpreted as evidence of an alliance between the Hyksos and Kermans.113 Intensive contacts between Kerma and the Hyksos are further attested by seals with the names of Asiatic rulers or with designs known from Avaris at Kerma.153 The troops of Kerma are known to have raided as far north as Elkab according to an inscription of Sobeknakht II.96 According to his second stele Kamose was effectively caught between the campaign for the siege of Avaris in the north and the offensive of Kerma in the south it is unknown whether or not the Kermans and Hyksos were able to combine forces against him.99 Kamose reports returning in triumph to Thebes but Lutz Popko suggests that this was perhaps a mere tactical retreat to prevent a war on two fronts.96 Ahmose I was also forced to confront a threat from the Nubians during his own siege of Avaris he was able to stop the forces of Kerma by sending a strong fleet killing their ruler named Aata.154155 Ahmose I boasts about these successes on his tomb at Thebes.154 The Kermans also appear to have provided mercenaries to the Hyksos.70 Vassalageedit Many scholars have described the Egyptian dynasties contemporary to the Hyksos as vassal dynasties an idea partially derived from the NineteenthDynasty literary text The Quarrel of Apophis and Seqenenre156 in which it is said the entire land paid tribute to him Apepi delivering their taxes in full as well as bringing all good produce of Egypt.157 The belief in Hyksos vassalage was challenged by Ryholt as a baseless assumption.158 Roxana Flammini suggests instead that Hyksos exerted influence through sometimes imposed personal relationships and giftgiving.159 Manfred Bietak continues to refer to Hyksos vassals including minor dynasties of West Semitic rulers in Egypt.160 Society and cultureedit Royal construction and patronageedit The socalled Hyksos Sphinxes The socalled Hyksos Sphinxes are peculiar sphinxes of Amenemhat III which were reinscribed by several Hyksos rulers including Apepi. Earlier Egyptologists thought these were the faces of actual Hyksos rulers.161 Remains of a statue of the Twelfth Dynasty reappropriated by Hyksos ruler Khyan with his name inscribed on the sides over an erasure.162 The Hyksos do not appear to have produced any court art163 instead appropriating monuments from earlier dynasties by writing their names on them. Many of these are inscribed with the name of King Khyan.164 A large palace at Avaris has been uncovered built in the Levantine rather than the Egyptian style most likely by Khyan.165 King Apepi is known to have patronized Egyptian scribal culture commissioning the copying of the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.166 The stories preserved in the Westcar Papyrus may also date from his reign.167 The socalled Hyksos sphinxes or Tanite sphinxes are a group of royal sphinxes depicting the earlier pharaoh Amenemhat III Twelfth Dynasty with some unusual traits compared to conventional statuary for example prominent cheekbones and the thick mane of a lion instead of the traditional nemes headcloth. The name Hyksos sphinxes was given due to the fact that these were later reinscribed by several of the Hyksos kings and were initially thought to represent the Hyksos kings themselves. Nineteenthcentury scholars attempted to use the statues features to assign a racial origin to the Hyksos.168 These Sphinxes were seized by the Hyksos from cities of the Middle Kingdom and then transported to their capital Avaris where they were reinscribed with the names of their new owners and adorned their palace.161 Seven of those sphinxes are known all from Tanis and now mostly located in the Cairo Museum.161169 Other statues of Amenehat III were found in Tanis and are associated with the Hyksos in the same manner. Burial practicesedit Evidence for distinct Hyksos burial practices in the archaeological record include burying their dead within settlements rather than outside them like the Egyptians.170 While some of the tombs include Egyptianstyle chapels they also include burials of young females probably sacrifices placed in front of the tomb chamber.165 There are also no surviving Hyksos funeral monuments in the desert in the Egyptian style though these may have been destroyed.77 The Hyksos also interred infants who died in imported Canaanite amphorae.171 The Hyksos also practiced the burial of horses and other equids likely a composite custom of the Egyptian association of the god Set with the donkey and neareastern notions of equids as representing status.172 Technologyedit The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus was copied for the Hyksos king Apepi. The Hyksos use of horse burials suggest that the Hyksos introduced both the horse and the chariot to Egypt173 however no archaeological pictorial or textual evidence exists that the Hyksos possessed chariots which are first mentioned as ridden by the Egyptians in warfare against them by Ahmose son of Ebana at the close of Hyksos rule.174 In any case it does not appear that chariots played any large role in the Hyksos rise to power or their expulsion.175 Josef Wegner further argues that horseriding may have been present in Egypt as early as the late Middle Kingdom prior to the adoption of chariot technology.176 Traditionally the Hyksos have also been credited with introducing a number of other military innovations such as the sicklesword and composite bow however to what extent the kingdom of Avaris should be credited for these innovations is debatable with scholarly opinion currently divided.14 It is also possible that the Hyksos introduced more advanced bronze working techniques though this is inconclusive. They may have worn fullbody armor177 whereas the Egyptians did not wear armor or helmets until the New Kingdom.178 The Hyksos also introduced better weaving techniques and new musical instruments to Egypt.177 They introduced improvements in viniculture as well.74 Egyptian duckbillshaped axe blade of SyroPalestinian type a lethal technology probably introduced by the Hyksos 19811550 BC.178 A bronze Hyksosperiod spearhead found in Lachish 17801580 BC.179 The horse was probably introduced to Egypt by the Hyksos and became a favourite subject of Egyptian art as in this whip handle from the reign of Amenhotep III 13901353 BC.180 The twowheeled horse chariot here found in the tomb of Tutankhamun may have been introduced to Egypt by the Hyksos.173 Trade and economyedit An example of Egyptian Tell elYahudiyeh Ware a Levantineinfluenced style. The early period of Hyksos period established their capital of Avaris as the commercial capital of the Delta.181 The trading relations of the Hyksos were mainly with Canaan and Cyprus.13182 Trade with Canaan is said to have been intensive especially with many imports of Canaanite wares and may have reflected the Canaanite origins of the dynasty.183 Trade was mostly with the cities of the northern Levant but connections with the southern Levant also developed.49 Additionally trade was conducted with Faiyum Memphis oases in Egypt Nubia and Mesopotamia.181 Trade relations with Cyprus were also very important particularly at the end of the Hyksos period.13184 Aaron Burke has interpreted the equid burials in Avaris of evidence that the people buried with them were involved in the caravan trade.185 AnnaLatifa Mourad argues that Hyksos were particularly interested in opening new avenues of trade securing strategic posts in the eastern Delta that could give access to landbased and seabased trade routes.181 These include the apparent Hyksos settlements of Tell elHabwa I and Tell elMaskhuta in the eastern Delta.83 According to the Kamose stelae the Hyksos imported chariots and horses ships timber gold lapis lazuli silver turquoise bronze axes without number oil incense fat and honey.13 The Hyksos also exported large quantities of material looted from southern Egypt especially Egyptian sculptures to the areas of Canaan and Syria.183 These transfers of Egyptian artifacts to the Near East may especially be attributed to king Apepi.183 The Hyksos also produced local Levantineinfluenced industries such as Tell elYahudiyeh Ware.181 There is little evidence of trade between Upper and Lower Egypt during the Hyksos period and Manfred Bietak proposes that there was a mutual trade boycott. Bietak proposes that this decreased the Hyksos ability to trade with the Mediterranean and weakened their economy.74 Religionedit Drawing of a Hyksosera scarab found at Tell elDaba depicting the pharaoh as the NearEastern weather god Baal or vice versa.186 The aim appears to be to present the Hyksos ruler as a divine figure.12 Original privately owned kept at the University of Fribourg.187 Temples in Avaris existed both in Egyptian and Levantine style the latter presumably for Levantine gods.188 The Hyksos are known to have worshiped the Canaanite storm god Baal who was associated with the Egyptian god Set.189 Set appears to have been the patron god of Avaris as early as the Fourteenth Dynasty.190 Hyksos iconography of their kings on some scarabs shows a mixture of Egyptian pharaonic dress with a raised club the iconography of Baal.12 Despite later sources claiming the Hyksos were opposed to the worship of other gods votive objects given by Hyksos rulers to gods such as Ra Hathor Sobek and Wadjet have also survived.191 Potential biblical connectionsedit In the ManethonianJosephus traditionedit Josephus and most of the writers of antiquity associated the Hyksos with the Jews.192 Quoting from Manethos Aegyptiaca Josephus states that when the Hyksos were expelled from Egypt they founded Jerusalem Contra Apion I.
90.1 93 It is unclear if this is original to Manetho or Josephuss own addition as Manetho does not mention Jews or Hebrews in his preserved account of the expulsion.194 Josephuss account of Manetho connects the expulsion of the Hyksos to another event two hundred years later in which a group of lepers led by the priest Osarseph were expelled from Egypt to the abandoned Avaris. There they ally with the Hyksos and rule over Egypt for thirteen years before being driven out during which time they oppress the Egyptians and destroy their temples. After the expulsion Osarseph changes his name to Moses Contra Apion I.2272
50.1 95 Assmann argues that this second account is largely a mixture of the experiences of the later Amarna period with the Hyksos invasion with Osarseph likely standing in for Akhenaten.196197 The final mention of Osarseph in which he changes his name to Moses may be a later interpolation.198 The second account is sometimes held not to have been written by Manetho at all.199 In modern scholarshipedit See also The Exodus and Sources and parallels of the Exodus The majority of modern scholars do not believe that the Egyptian story elements in the Bible can be demonstrated with historical methods. However some scholars have attempted to tie the narratives of the Hyksos period to the exodus period.200 Scholars such as Jan Assmann and Donald Redford for instance have suggested that the story of the biblical exodus may have been wholly or partially inspired by the expulsion of the Hyksos.201202203 An identification with the Hyksos would only depart minimally from accepted biblical chronology and their expulsion is the only known largescale expulsion of Asiatics from Egypt.204 Other scholars such with Manfred Bietak have pointed out several problems with such theories including the conflict between the portrayal of the Hyksos as a ruling elite with a background in trade and seafaring and the biblical portrayal of the Israelites as oppressed in Egypt.205 Semitic visitors to Egypt in the Tomb of Khnumhotep II c. 1900 BC John Bright states that Egyptian and Biblical records both suggest that Semitic people maintained access to Egypt at all periods of Egypts history and he suggested that it is tempting to suppose that Joseph who according to the Old Testament Genesis 3950 was in favour at the Egyptian court and held high administrative positions next to the ruler of the land was associated to the Hyksos rule in Egypt during the Fifteenth Dynasty. Such a connection might have been facilitated by their shared Semitic ethnicity. He also wrote that there is no proof for these events.57 Howard Vos has suggested that the coat of many colors said to have been worn by Joseph could be similar to the colorful garments seen in the painting of foreigners in the tomb of Khnumhotep II.206 Ronald B. Geobey notes a number of problems with identifying the narrative of Joseph with events either prior to or during the Hyksos rule such as the detail that the Egyptians abhorred Josephs people shepherds Gen. 4631 and numerous anachronisms.207 Manfred Bietak suggests that the story fits better with the ambience of the later Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt in particular with the xenophobic policy of pharaoh Setnakhte 11891186 BC.208 And Donald Redford argues that to read the Joseph story as history is quite wrongheaded209 while Megan Bishop Moore and Brad E. Kelle note the lack of any extrabiblical evidence for the events of Genesis including the Joseph story or Exodus.210 A number of scholars do not believe that the exodus has any historical basis at all while only scholars on the fundamentalist fringe accept the entire biblical account unless it can be absolutely disproved.211 The current consensus among archaeologists is that if an Israelite exodus from Egypt occurred it must have happened instead in the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt 
13 th century BC given the first appearance of a distinctive Israelite culture in the archaeological record.212 The potential connection of the Hyksos to the exodus is no longer a central focus of scholarly study of the Hyksos46 but this supposed connection to the Exodus has continued to inspire popular interest.53 Legacyedit Four Foreign Chieftains from tomb TT39 Metropolitan Museum of Art MET DT10871. Ca. 14791458 BC Egyptian relief depicting a battle against West Asiatics. Reign of Amenhotep II Eighteenth Dynasty c. 14271400 BC. The Hyksos rule continued to be condemned by New Kingdom pharaohs such as Hatshepsut who 80 years after their defeat claimed to rebuild many shrines and temples which they had neglected.163 Ramses II moved Egypts capital to the Delta building PiRamesses on the site of Avaris213 where he set up a stela marking the 4
00 th anniversary of the cult of Set. Scholars used to suggest that this marked 400 years since the Hyksos had established their rule however the lists of Ramesses ancestors continued to omit the Hyksos and there is no evidence that they were honored during his reign.214 The Turin King List which includes the Hyksos and all other disputed or disgraced former rulers of Egypt appears to date from the reign of Ramesses or one of his successors.215 The Hyksos are marked as foreign kings via a throwstick determinative rather than a divine determinative after their names and the use of the title qswt rather than the usual royal title.216 Kim Ryholt notes that these measures are unique to the Hyksos rulers and may therefore have been a direct result of what seems to have been deliberate attempt to obliterate the memory of their kingship after their defeat.217 Egyptian presence in the Levantedit It is often accepted that Egypt established an empire in Canaan at the end of the wars against the Hyksos.218 Campaigns against locations in Canaan and Syria were conducted by Ahmose I and Thutmose I at the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty as recorded in the tombs of Ahmose son of Ebana and Ahmose penNekhebet Thutmose I is also mentioned as having hunted elephants in Syria in inscriptions at the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir elBahari.219 Thutmose III is known to have campaigned widely conquering the Shasu Bedouins of northern Canaan and the land of Retjenu as far as Syria and Mittani in numerous military campaigns circa 1450 BC.220221 However Felix Hflmayer argues that there is little evidence of other campaigns and that there is no evidence that would suggest such a scenario as an Egyptian empire during the Eighteenth Dynasty.222 As regards claims that the campaigns in the Near East were spurred on by Hyksos rule Thomas Schneider argues that the empire building started with a delay of two generations and seeing a direct nexus may be as much a historical fallacy as it would be to link the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989 to the end of the Second World War in 1945 two generations earlier.223 Retjenu Syrians bringing tribute to Tuthmosis III in the tomb of Rekhmire c. 1450 BC actual painting and interpretive drawing.

Cairo Museum.226 The NineteenthDynasty story The Quarrel of Apophis and Seqenenre claimed that the Hyksos worshiped no god but Set making the conflict into one between Ra the patron of Thebes and Set as patron of Avaris.227 Furthermore the battle with the Hyksos was interpreted in light of the mythical battle between the gods Horus and Set transforming Set into an Asiatic deity while also allowing for the integration of Asiatics into Egyptian society.228 Manethos portrayal of the Hyksos written nearly 1300 years after the end of Hyksos rule and found in Josephus is even more negative than the New Kingdom sources.163 This account portrayed the Hyksos as violent conquerors and oppressors of Egypt has been highly influential for perceptions of the Hyksos until modern times.229 Marc van de Mieroop argues that Josephuss portrayal of the initial Hyksos invasion is no more trustworthy than his later claims that they were related to the Exodus supposedly portrayed in Manetho as performed by a band of lepers.230 Early modern depictionsedit The discovery of the Hyksos in the

Bietak gives c. 16401532 BC6 Schneider gives c. 16391521 BC7 and Stiebing gives c. 16301530 BC.8  Spelling of the hieroglyphs in sources describing the archaeological record of the historical Hyksos first set of characters is the singular as appearing in Abisha the Hyksos in the tomb of Khnumhotep II c.1900 BC.19 The second set is in the plural as appears in the inscriptions of known Hyksos rulers SakirHar Semqen Khyan and Aperanat.20  Two separate misconceptions persist both in the scholarship and more popular works surrounding the word Hyksos. The first is that this term is the name of a defined and relatively large population group see below when in fact it is only a royal title held exclusively by individual rulers. Any standalone use of the word Hyksos in the following article refers specifically to the foreign kings of the 
15 th Dynasty.29 Josephus also misrepresents the Hyksos as a population group ethnos as opposed to a dynasty.6 Flavius Josephus used the designation Hyksos incorrectly as a kind of ethnic term for people of foreign origin who seized power in Egypt for a certain period. In this sense for the sake of convenience it is also used in the title and section headings of the present article. One should never forget however that strictly spoken the Hyksos were only the kings of the Fifteenth Dynasty and of simultaneous minor dynasties who took the title qwswt.30  While Schneider identifies each of the names in Menatho with a pharaoh he does not hold to Manethos order of the reigns. So for instance he identifies SakirHar with ArchlesAssis the sixth king in Manetho but proposes he reigned first.146  Identified with Salitis by Bietak.70  This name appears as a separate individual preceding Apepi but it appears to mean brave ass and may be a disparaging reference to Apepi.147  In Eusebius and Africanuss epitomes of Manetho Apopis appears in final position while Archles appears as the fifth ruler. In Josephus Assis is the final ruler and Apophis the fifth ruler. The association of the names Archles and Assis with one another is a modern reconstruction.142  Redford argues that the name suits neither Assis nor Apophis.147  In the epitome of Manetho by Eusebius the total instead comes to 284 years.132  This reading is based on a partially damaged section of the papyrus. Reconstructions of the damaged Turin King List proposed in 2018 would change the reading of years to up to 149 years Ryholt or between 160 and 180 years Schneider.76 Citationsedit  a b c d Van de Mieroop 2011 p. 131.  a b c Bard 2015 p. 188.  a b Willems 2010 p. 96.  a b c Bourriau 2000 p. 174.
