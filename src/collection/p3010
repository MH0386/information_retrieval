It is generally understood to mean the period and territory ruled by the Romans following Octavians assumption of sole rule under the Principate in 27 BC. It included territories in Europe North Africa and Western Asia and was ruled by emperors. The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD conventionally marks the end of classical antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Rome had expanded its rule to most of the Mediterranean and beyond. However it was severely destabilized in civil wars and political conflicts which culminated in the victory of Octavian over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt. In 27 BC the Roman Senate granted Octavian overarching power imperium and the new title of Augustus marking his accession as the first Roman emperor of a monarchy with Rome as its sole capital. The vast Roman territories were organized in senatorial and imperial provinces. The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana lit.Roman Peace. Rome reached its greatest territorial expanse under Trajan r.98117 AD a period of increasing trouble and decline began under Commodus 180192. In the 
3 rd century the Empire underwent a crisis that threatened its existence as the Gallic and Palmyrene Empires broke away from the Roman state and a series of shortlived emperors led the Empire. It was reunified under Aurelian r.270275. Diocletian set up two different imperial courts in the Greek East and Latin West in 286 Christians rose to power in the 
4 th century after the Edict of Milan. The imperial seat moved from Rome to Byzantium in 330 renamed Constantinople after Constantine the Great. The Migration Period involving large invasions by Germanic peoples and by the Huns of Attila led to the decline of the Western Roman Empire. With the fall of Ravenna to the Germanic Herulians and the deposition of Romulus Augustus in 476 AD by Odoacer the Western Roman Empire finally collapsed. The Eastern Roman Empire survived for another millennium with Constantinople as its sole capital until the citys fall in 1453.f Due to the Empires extent and endurance its institutions and culture had a lasting influence on the development of language religion art architecture literature philosophy law and forms of government across its territories. Latin evolved into the Romance languages while Medieval Greek became the language of the East. The Empires adoption of Christianity resulted in the formation of medieval Christendom. Roman and Greek art had a profound impact on the Italian Renaissance. Romes architectural tradition served as the basis for Romanesque Renaissance and Neoclassical architecture influencing Islamic architecture. The rediscovery of classical science and technology which formed the basis for Islamic science in medieval Europe contributed to the Scientific Renaissance and Scientific Revolution. Many modern legal systems such as the Napoleonic Code descend from Roman law. Romes republican institutions have influenced the Italian citystate republics of the medieval period the early United States and modern democratic republics. History Main article History of the Roman Empire For a chronological guide see Timeline of Roman history. See also Campaign history of the Roman military and Roman Kingdom Animated overview of the Roman territorial history from the Roman Republic until the fall of its last remnant the Byzantine Empire in 1453 Transition from Republic to Empire Further information Roman Republic Augustus of Prima Porta Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Roman Republic in the 
6 th century BC though not outside the Italian peninsula until the 
3 rd century BC. Thus it was an empire a great power long before it had an emperor.20 The Republic was not a nationstate in the modern sense but a network of selfruled towns with varying degrees of independence from the Senate and provinces administered by military commanders. It was governed by annually elected magistrates Roman consuls above all in conjunction with the Senate.21 The 
1 st century BC was a time of political and military upheaval which ultimately led to rule by emperors.222324 The consuls military power rested in the Roman legal concept of imperium meaning command though typically in a military sense.25 Occasionally successful consuls were given the honorary title imperator commander this is the origin of the word emperor since this title was always bestowed to the early emperors.26 Rome suffered a long series of internal conflicts conspiracies and civil wars from the late second century BC see Crisis of the Roman Republic while greatly extending its power beyond Italy. In 44 BC Julius Caesar was briefly dictator before being assassinated. The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC by Mark Antony and Caesars adopted son Octavian. Antony and Octavians division of the Roman world did not last and Octavians forces defeated those of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. In 27 BC the Senate made Octavian princeps first citizen with proconsular imperium thus beginning the Principate the first epoch of Roman imperial history usually dated from 27 BC to 284 AD and gave him the title Augustus the venerated. Although the republic stood in name Augustus had all meaningful authority.27 Since his rule began an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity he was so loved that he came to hold the power of a monarch de facto if not de jure. During the years of his rule a new constitutional order emerged in part organically and in part by design so that upon his death this new constitutional order operated as before when Tiberius was accepted as the new emperor.citation needed Pax Romana Main article Pax Romana The socalled Five Good Emperors of 96180 AD Nerva r.9698 Trajan r.98117 Hadrian r.117138 Antoninus Pius r.138161 Marcus Aurelius r.161180 The 200 years that began with Augustuss rule is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana Roman Peace. The cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced. Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent and put down mercilessly and swiftly.28 The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs. The JulioClaudian dynasty lasted for four more emperorsTiberius Caligula Claudius and Nerobefore it yielded in 69 AD to the strifetorn Year of the Four Emperors from which Vespasian emerged as victor. Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty followed by the NervaAntonine dynasty which produced the Five Good Emperors Nerva Trajan Hadrian Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius.citation needed Transition from Classical to Late Antiquity Main articles Later Roman Empire and Fall of the Western Roman Empire See also Barbarian kingdoms and Byzantine Empire The Barbarian Invasions consisted of the movement of mainly ancient Germanic peoples into Roman territory. Historically this event marked the transition between classical antiquity and the Middle Ages. In the view of contemporary Greek historian Cassius Dio the accession of Commodus in 180 marked the descent from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron29 a comment which has led some historians notably Edward Gibbon to take Commodus reign as the beginning of the Empires decline.3031 In 212 during the reign of Caracalla Roman citizenship was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. The Severan dynasty was tumultuous an emperors reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution and following its collapse the Empire was engulfed by the Crisis of the Third Century a period of invasions civil strife economic disorder and plague.32 In defining historical epochs this crisis sometimes marks the transition from Classical to Late Antiquity. Aurelian r.270275 stabilised the empire militarily and Diocletian reorganised and restored much of it in 2
85.3 3 Diocletians reign brought the empires most concerted effort against the perceived threat of Christianity the Great Persecution.citation needed Diocletian divided the empire into four regions each ruled by a separate tetrarch.34 Confident that he fixed the disorder plaguing Rome he abdicated along with his coemperor but the Tetrarchy collapsed shortly after. Order was eventually restored by Constantine the Great who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity and who established Constantinople as the new capital of the Eastern Empire. During the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties the empire was divided along an eastwest axis with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome. Julian who under the influence of his adviser Mardonius attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Theodosius I the last emperor to rule over both East and West died in 395 after making Christianity the state religion.35 The Roman Empire by 476 noting western and eastern divisions The administrative divisions of the Roman Empire in 395 AD Fall in the West and survival in the East The Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate in the early 
5 th century. The Romans were successful in fighting off all invaders most famously Attila36 but the empire had assimilated so many Germanic peoples of dubious loyalty to Rome that the empire started to dismember itself.37 Most chronologies place the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476 when Romulus Augustulus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer.383940 Odoacer ended the Western Empire by declaring Zeno sole emperor and placing himself as Zenos nominal subordinate. In reality Italy was ruled by Odoacer alone.383941 The Eastern Roman Empire called the Byzantine Empire by later historians continued until the reign of Constantine XI Palaiologos. The last Roman emperor died in battle in 1453 against Mehmed II and his Ottoman forces during the siege of Constantinople. Mehmed II adopted the title of caesar in an attempt to claim a connection to the Empire.42 Geography and demography Main articles Demography of the Roman Empire and Borders of the Roman Empire Further information Classical demography The Roman Empire was one of the largest in history with contiguous territories throughout Europe North Africa and the Middle East.43 The Latin phrase imperium sine fine empire without end44 expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire. In Virgils Aeneid limitless empire is said to be granted to the Romans by Jupiter.45 This claim of universal dominion was renewed when the Empire came under Christian rule in the 
4 th century.g In addition to annexing large regions the Romans directly altered their geography for example cutting down entire forests.47 Roman expansion was mostly accomplished under the Republic though parts of northern Europe were conquered in the 
1 st century when Roman control in Europe Africa and Asia was strengthened. Under Augustus a global map of the known world was displayed for the first time in public at Rome coinciding with the creation of the most comprehensive political geography that survives from antiquity the Geography of Strabo.48 When Augustus died the account of his achievements Res Gestae prominently featured the geographical cataloguing of the Empire.49 Geography alongside meticulous written records were central concerns of Roman Imperial administration.50 A segment of the ruins of Hadrians Wall in northern England overlooking Crag Lough The Empire reached its largest expanse under Trajan r.9811751 encompassing 5 million square kilometres.1516 The traditional population estimate of 5560 million inhabitants52 accounted for between onesixth and onefourth of the worlds total population53 and made it the most populous unified political entity in the West until the mid
19 th century.54 Recent demographic studies have argued for a population peak from 70 million to more than 100 million.55 Each of the three largest cities in the Empire  Rome Alexandria and Antioch  was almost twice the size of any European city at the beginning of the 
17 th century.56 As the historian Christopher Kelly described it Then the empire stretched from Hadrians Wall in drizzlesoaked northern England to the sunbaked banks of the Euphrates in Syria from the great RhineDanube river system which snaked across the fertile flat lands of Europe from the Low Countries to the Black Sea to the rich plains of the North African coast and the luxuriant gash of the Nile Valley in Egypt. The empire completely circled the Mediterranean ... referred to by its conquerors as mare nostrumour sea.52 Trajans successor Hadrian adopted a policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders fines were marked and the frontiers limites patrolled.51 The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable.23 Hadrians Wall which separated the Roman world from what was perceived as an everpresent barbarian threat is the primary surviving monument of this effort.57 Languages Main article Languages of the Roman Empire See also Jireek Line Latin and Greek were the main languages of the Empireh but the Empire was deliberately multilingual.62 Andrew WallaceHadrill says The main desire of the Roman government was to make itself understood.63 At the start of the Empire knowledge of Greek was useful to pass as educated nobility and knowledge of Latin was useful for a career in the military government or law.64 Bilingual inscriptions indicate the everyday interpenetration of the two languages.65 Latin and Greeks mutual linguistic and cultural influence is a complex topic.66 Latin words incorporated into Greek were very common by the early imperial era especially for military administration and trade and commerce matters.67 Greek grammar literature poetry and philosophy shaped Latin language and culture.6869 A 
5 thcentury papyrus showing a parallel LatinGreek text of a speech by Cicero70 There was never a legal requirement for Latin in the Empire but it represented a certain status.71 High standards of Latin Latinitas started with the advent of Latin literature.72 Due to the flexible language policy of the Empire a natural competition of language emerged that spurred Latinitas to defend Latin against the stronger cultural influence of Greek.73 Over time Latin usage was used to project power and a higher social class.7475 Most of the emperors were bilingual but had a preference for Latin in the public sphere for political reasons a rule that first started during the Punic Wars.76 Different emperors up until Justinian would attempt to require the use of Latin in various sections of the administration but there is no evidence that a linguistic imperialism existed during the early Empire.77 After all freeborn inhabitants were universally enfranchised in 212 many Roman citizens would have lacked a knowledge of Latin.78 The wide use of Koine Greek was what enabled the spread of Christianity and reflects its role as the lingua franca of the Mediterranean during the time of the Empire.79 Following Diocletians reforms in the 
3 rd century CE there was a decline in the knowledge of Greek in the west.80 Spoken Latin later fragmented into the incipient romance languages in the 
7 th century CE following the collapse of the Empires west.81 The dominance of Latin and Greek among the literate elite obscure the continuity of other spoken languages within the Empire.82 Latin referred to in its spoken form as Vulgar Latin gradually replaced Celtic and Italic languages.8384 References to interpreters indicate the continuing use of local languages particularly in Egypt with Coptic and in military settings along the Rhine and Danube. Roman jurists also show a concern for local languages such as Punic Gaulish and Aramaic in assuring the correct understanding of laws and oaths.85 In Africa LibycoBerber and Punic were used in inscriptions into the 
2 nd century.82 In Syria Palmyrene soldiers used their dialect of Aramaic for inscriptions an exception to the rule that Latin was the language of the military.86 The last reference to Gaulish was between 560 and 5
75.8 788 The emergent GalloRomance languages would then be shaped by Gaulish.89 ProtoBasque or Aquitanian evolved with Latin loan words to modern Basque.90 The Thracian language as were several nowextinct languages in Anatolia are attested in Imperialera inscriptions.7982 Gate of Domitian and Trajan at the northern entrance of the Temple of Hathor and Roman emperor Domitian as Pharaoh of Egypt on the same gate together with Egyptian hieroglyphs.91 Society Further information Ancient Roman society A multigenerational banquet depicted on a wall painting from Pompeii 
1 st century AD The Empire was remarkably multicultural with astonishing cohesive capacity to create shared identity while encompassing diverse peoples.92 Public monuments and communal spaces open to allsuch as forums amphitheatres racetracks and bathshelped foster a sense of Romanness.93 Roman society had multiple overlapping social hierarchies.94 The civil war preceding Augustus caused upheaval95 but did not effect an immediate redistribution of wealth and social power. From the perspective of the lower classes a peak was merely added to the social pyramid.96 Personal relationshipspatronage friendship amicitia family marriagecontinued to influence politics.97 By the time of Nero however it was not unusual to find a former slave who was richer than a freeborn citizen or an equestrian who exercised greater power than a senator.98 The blurring of the Republics more rigid hierarchies led to increased social mobility99 both upward and downward to a greater extent than all other welldocumented ancient societies.100 Women freedmen and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence in ways previously less available to them.101 Social life particularly for those whose personal resources were limited was further fostered by a proliferation of voluntary associations and confraternities collegia and sodalitates professional and trade guilds veterans groups religious sodalities drinking and dining clubs102 performing troupes103 and burial societies.104 Legal status Main articles Status in Roman legal system and Roman citizenship According to the jurist Gaius the essential distinction in the Roman law of persons was that all humans were either free liberi or slaves servi.105 The legal status of free persons was further defined by their citizenship. Most citizens held limited rights such as the ius Latinum Latin right but were entitled to legal protections and privileges not enjoyed by noncitizens. Free people not considered citizens but living within the Roman world were peregrini nonRomans.106 In 212 the Constitutio Antoniniana extended citizenship to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. This legal egalitarianism required a farreaching revision of existing laws that distinguished between citizens and noncitizens.107 Women in Roman law Main article Women in ancient Rome Left Fresco of an auburn maiden reading a text Pompeian Fourth Style 6079 AD Pompeii Italy Right Bronze statuette 
1 st century AD of a young woman reading based on a Hellenistic original Freeborn Roman women were considered citizens but did not vote hold political office or serve in the military. A mothers citizen status determined that of her children as indicated by the phrase ex duobus civibus Romanis natos children born of two Roman citizens.i A Roman woman kept her own family name nomen for life. Children most often took the fathers name with some exceptions.110 Women could own property enter contracts and engage in business.111 Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works an indication they could hold considerable fortunes.112 The archaic manus marriage in which the woman was subject to her husbands authority was largely abandoned by the Imperial era and a married woman retained ownership of any property she brought into the marriage. Technically she remained under her fathers legal authority even though she moved into her husbands home but when her father died she became legally emancipated.113 This arrangement was a factor in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed compared to many other cultures up to the modern period114 although she had to answer to her father in legal matters she was free of his direct scrutiny in daily life115 and her husband had no legal power over her.116 Although it was a point of pride to be a oneman woman univira who had married only once there was little stigma attached to divorce nor to speedy remarriage after being widowed or divorced.117 Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will.118 A mothers right to own and dispose of property including setting the terms of her will gave her enormous influence over her sons into adulthood.119 Dressing of a priestess or bride Roman fresco from Herculaneum Italy 3040 AD As part of the Augustan programme to restore traditional morality and social order moral legislation attempted to regulate conduct as a means of promoting family values. Adultery was criminalized120 and defined broadly as an illicit sex act stuprum between a male citizen and a married woman or between a married woman and any man other than her husband. That is a double standard was in place a married woman could have sex only with her husband but a married man did not commit adultery if he had sex with a prostitute or person of marginalized status.121 Childbearing was encouraged a woman who had given birth to three children was granted symbolic honours and greater legal freedom the ius trium liberorum.122 Slaves and the law Main article Slavery in ancient Rome At the time of Augustus as many as 35 of the people in Roman Italy were slaves123 making Rome one of five historical slave societies in which slaves constituted at least a fifth of the population and played a major role in the economy.j123 Slavery was a complex institution that supported traditional Roman social structures as well as contributing economic utility.124 In urban settings slaves might be professionals such as teachers physicians chefs and accountants the majority of slaves provided trained or unskilled labour. Agriculture and industry such as milling and mining relied on the exploitation of slaves. Outside Italy slaves were on average an estimated 10 to 20 of the population sparse in Roman Egypt but more concentrated in some Greek areas. Expanding Roman ownership of arable land and industries affected preexisting practices of slavery in the provinces.125 Although slavery has often been regarded as waning in the 
3 rd and 
4 th centuries it remained an integral part of Roman society until gradually ceasing in the 
6 th and 
7 th centuries with the disintegration of the complex Imperial economy.126 Slave holding writing tablets for his master relief from a 
4 thcentury sarcophagus Laws pertaining to slavery were extremely intricate.127 Slaves were considered property and had no legal personhood. They could be subjected to forms of corporal punishment not normally exercised on citizens sexual exploitation torture and summary execution. A slave could not as a matter of law be raped a slaves rapist had to be prosecuted by the owner for property damage under the Aquilian Law.128 Slaves had no right to the form of legal marriage called conubium but their unions were sometimes recognized.129 Technically a slave could not own property130 but a slave who conducted business might be given access to an individual fund peculium that he could use depending on the degree of trust and cooperation between owner and slave.131 Within a household or workplace a hierarchy of slaves might exist with one slave acting as the master of others.132 Talented slaves might accumulate a large enough peculium to justify their freedom or be manumitted for services rendered. Manumission had become frequent enough that in 2 BC a law Lex Fufia Caninia limited the number of slaves an owner was allowed to free in his will.133 Following the Servile Wars of the Republic legislation under Augustus and his successors shows a driving concern for controlling the threat of rebellions through limiting the size of work groups and for hunting down fugitive slaves.134 Over time slaves gained increased legal protection including the right to file complaints against their masters. A bill of sale might contain a clause stipulating that the slave could not be employed for prostitution as prostitutes in ancient Rome were often slaves.135 The burgeoning trade in eunuchs in the late 
1 st century prompted legislation that prohibited the castration of a slave against his will for lust or gain.136 Roman slavery was not based on race.137 Generally slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians138 with a minority of foreigners including both slaves and freedmen estimated at 5 of the total in the capital at its peak where their number was largest. Foreign slaves had higher mortality and lower birth rates than natives and were sometimes even subjected to mass expulsions.139 The average recorded age at death for the slaves of the city of Rome was seventeen and a half years 
17.2  for males 
17.9  for females.140 During the period of republican expansionism when slavery had become pervasive war captives were a main source of slaves. The range of ethnicities among slaves to some extent reflected that of the armies Rome defeated in war and the conquest of Greece brought a number of highly skilled and educated slaves. Slaves were also traded in markets and sometimes sold by pirates. Infant abandonment and selfenslavement among the poor were other sources.141 Vernae by contrast were homegrown slaves born to female slaves within the household estate or farm. Although they had no special legal status an owner who mistreated or failed to care for his vernae faced social disapproval as they were considered part of the family household and in some cases might actually be the children of free males in the family.142 Freedmen Cinerary urn for the freedman Tiberius Claudius Chryseros and two women probably his wife and daughter Rome differed from Greek citystates in allowing freed slaves to become citizens any future children of a freedman were born free with full rights of citizenship. After manumission a slave who had belonged to a Roman citizen enjoyed active political freedom libertas including the right to vote.143 His former master became his patron patronus the two continued to have customary and legal obligations to each other.144145 A freedman was not entitled to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods but could play a priestly role. He could not marry a woman from a senatorial family nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself but during the early Empire freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy so much so that Hadrian limited their participation by law.145 The rise of successful freedmenthrough political influence or wealthis a characteristic of early Imperial society. The prosperity of a highachieving group of freedmen is attested by inscriptions throughout the Empire and by their ownership of some of the most lavish houses at Pompeii.citation needed Census rank See also Senate of the Roman Empire Equestrian order and Decurion administrative The Latin word ordo plural ordines is translated variously and inexactly into English as class order rank. One purpose of the Roman census was to determine the ordo to which an individual belonged. The two highest ordines in Rome were the senatorial and equestrian.citation needed Outside Rome the decurions also known as curiales were the top governing ordo of an individual city.citation needed Fragment of a sarcophagus depicting Gordian III and senators 
3 rd century Senator was not itself an elected office in ancient Rome an individual gained admission to the Senate after he had been elected to and served at least one term as an executive magistrate. A senator also had to meet a minimum property requirement of 1 million sestertii.146 Not all men who qualified for the ordo senatorius chose to take a Senate seat which required legal domicile at Rome. Emperors often filled vacancies in the 6
00 member body by appointment.147 A senators son belonged to the ordo senatorius but he had to qualify on his own merits for admission to the Senate. A senator could be removed for violating moral standards.148 In the time of Nero senators were still primarily from Italy with some from the Iberian peninsula and southern France men from the Greekspeaking provinces of the East began to be added under Vespasian.149 The first senator from the easternmost province Cappadocia was admitted under Marcus Aurelius.k By the Severan dynasty 193235 Italians made up less than half the Senate.151 During the 
3 rd century domicile at Rome became impractical and inscriptions attest to senators who were active in politics and munificence in their homeland patria.148 Senators were the traditional governing class who rose through the cursus honorum the political career track but equestrians often possessed greater wealth and political power. Membership in the equestrian order was based on property in Romes early days equites or knights had been distinguished by their ability to serve as mounted warriors but cavalry service was a separate function in the Empire.l A census valuation of 400000 sesterces and three generations of free birth qualified a man as an equestrian.153 The census of 28 BC uncovered large numbers of men who qualified and in 14 AD a thousand equestrians were registered at Cdiz and Padua alone.m155 Equestrians rose through a military career track tres militiae to become highly placed prefects and procurators within the Imperial administration.156 The rise of provincial men to the senatorial and equestrian orders is an aspect of social mobility in the early Empire. Roman aristocracy was based on competition and unlike later European nobility a Roman family could not maintain its position merely through hereditary succession or having title to lands.157 Admission to the higher ordines brought distinction and privileges but also responsibilities. In antiquity a city depended on its leading citizens to fund public works events and services munera. Maintaining ones rank required massive personal expenditures.158 Decurions were so vital for the functioning of cities that in the later Empire as the ranks of the town councils became depleted those who had risen to the Senate were encouraged to return to their hometowns in an effort to sustain civic life.159 In the later Empire the dignitas worth esteem that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with titles such as vir illustris illustrious man.160 The appellation clarissimus Greek lamprotatos was used to designate the dignitas of certain senators and their immediate family including women.161 Grades of equestrian status proliferated.162 Unequal justice Condemned man attacked by a leopard in the arena 
3 rdcentury mosaic from Tunisia As the republican principle of citizens equality under the law faded the symbolic and social privileges of the upper classes led to an informal division of Roman society into those who had acquired greater honours honestiores and humbler folk humiliores. In general honestiores were the members of the three higher orders along with certain military officers.163 The granting of universal citizenship in 212 seems to have increased the competitive urge among the upper classes to have their superiority affirmed particularly within the justice system.164 Sentencing depended on the judgment of the presiding official as to the relative worth dignitas of the defendant an honestior could pay a fine for a crime for which an humilior might receive a scourging.165 Execution which was an infrequent legal penalty for free men under the Republic166 could be quick and relatively painless for honestiores while humiliores might suffer the kinds of torturous death previously reserved for slaves such as crucifixion and condemnation to the beasts.167 In the early Empire those who converted to Christianity could lose their standing as honestiores especially if they declined to fulfil religious responsibilities and thus became subject to punishments that created the conditions of martyrdom.168 Government and military Main article Constitution of the Roman Empire Forum of Gerasa Jerash in presentday Jordan with columns marking a covered walkway stoa for vendor stalls and a semicircular space for public speaking The three major elements of the Imperial state were the central government the military and the provincial government.169 The military established control of a territory through war but after a city or people was brought under treaty the mission turned to policing protecting Roman citizens agricultural fields and religious sites.170 The Romans lacked sufficient manpower or resources to rule through force alone. Cooperation with local elites was necessary to maintain order collect information and extract revenue. The Romans often exploited internal political divisions.171 Communities with demonstrated loyalty to Rome retained their own laws could collect their own taxes locally and in exceptional cases were exempt from Roman taxation. Legal privileges and relative independence incentivized compliance.172 Roman government was thus limited but efficient in its use of available resources.173 Central government See also Roman emperor and Senate of the Roman Empire Antoninus Pius r.138161 wearing a toga Hermitage Museum The Imperial cult of ancient Rome identified emperors and some members of their families with divinely sanctioned authority auctoritas. The rite of apotheosis also called consecratio signified the deceased emperors deification.174 The dominance of the emperor was based on the consolidation of powers from several republican offices.175 The emperor made himself the central religious authority as pontifex maximus and centralized the right to declare war ratify treaties and negotiate with foreign leaders.176 While these functions were clearly defined during the Principate the emperors powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical culminating in the Dominate.177 The emperor was the ultimate authority in policy and decisionmaking but in the early Principate he was expected to be accessible and deal personally with official business and petitions. A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually.178 The JulioClaudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians but trusted slaves and freedmen.179 After Nero the influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion and the emperors council consilium became subject to official appointment for greater transparency.180 Though the Senate took a lead in policy discussions until the end of the Antonine dynasty equestrians played an increasingly important role in the consilium.181 The women of the emperors family often intervened directly in his decisions.182 Access to the emperor might be gained at the daily reception salutatio a development of the traditional homage a client paid to his patron public banquets hosted at the palace and religious ceremonies. The common people who lacked this access could manifest their approval or displeasure as a group at games.183 By the 
4 th century the Christian emperors became remote figureheads who issued general rulings no longer responding to individual petitions.184 Although the Senate could do little short of assassination and open rebellion to contravene the will of the emperor it retained its symbolic political centrality.185 The Senate legitimated the emperors rule and the emperor employed senators as legates legati generals diplomats and administrators.186 The practical source of an emperors power and authority was the military. The legionaries were paid by the Imperial treasury and swore an annual oath of loyalty to the emperor.187 Most emperors chose a successor usually a close family member or adopted heir. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor could hope to survive without the allegiance of the Praetorian Guard and the legions. To secure their loyalty several emperors paid the donativum a monetary reward. In theory the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians.188 Military Winged Victory ancient Roman fresco of the Neronian era from Pompeii The Roman empire under Hadrian ruled 117138 showing the location of the Roman legions deployed in 125 AD Main articles Imperial Roman army Late Roman army and Structural history of the Roman military After the Punic Wars the Roman army comprised professional soldiers who volunteered for 20 years of active duty and five as reserves. The transition to a professional military began during the late Republic and was one of the many profound shifts away from republicanism under which an army of conscript citizens defended the homeland against a specific threat. The Romans expanded their war machine by organizing the communities that they conquered in Italy into a system that generated huge reservoirs of manpower for their army.189 By Imperial times military service was a fulltime career.190 The pervasiveness of military garrisons throughout the Empire was a major influence in the process of Romanization.191 The primary mission of the military of the early empire was to preserve the Pax Romana.192 The three major divisions of the military were the garrison at Rome comprising the Praetorian Guard the cohortes urbanae and the vigiles who functioned as police and firefighters the provincial army comprising the Roman legions and the auxiliaries provided by the provinces auxilia the navy. Relief panel from Trajans Column in Rome showing the building of a fort and the reception of a Dacian embassy Through his military reforms which included consolidating or disbanding units of questionable loyalty Augustus regularized the legion. A legion was organized into ten cohorts each of which comprised six centuries with a century further made up of ten squads contubernia the exact size of the Imperial legion which was likely determined by logistics has been estimated to range from 4800 to 52
80.1 93 After Germanic tribes wiped out three legions in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD the number of legions was increased from 25 to around 
30.1 94 The army had about 300000 soldiers in the 
1 st century and under 400000 in the 
2 nd significantly smaller than the collective armed forces of the conquered territories. No more than 2 of adult males living in the Empire served in the Imperial army.195 Augustus also created the Praetorian Guard nine cohorts ostensibly to maintain the public peace which were garrisoned in Italy. Better paid than the legionaries the Praetorians served only sixteen years.196 The auxilia were recruited from among the noncitizens. Organized in smaller units of roughly cohort strength they were paid less than the legionaries and after 25 years of service were rewarded with Roman citizenship also extended to their sons. According to Tacitus197 there were roughly as many auxiliaries as there were legionariesthus around 125000 men implying approximately 250 auxiliary regiments.198 The Roman cavalry of the earliest Empire were primarily from Celtic Hispanic or Germanic areas. Several aspects of training and equipment derived from the Celts.199 The Roman navy not only aided in the supply and transport of the legions but also in the protection of the frontiers along the rivers Rhine and Danube. Another duty was protecting maritime trade against pirates. It patrolled the Mediterranean parts of the North Atlantic coasts and the Black Sea. Nevertheless the army was considered the senior and more prestigious branch.200 Provincial government An annexed territory became a Roman province in three steps making a register of cities taking a census and surveying the land.201 Further government recordkeeping included births and deaths real estate transactions taxes and juridical proceedings.202 In the 
1 st and 
2 nd centuries the central government sent out around 160 officials annually to govern outside Italy.21 Among these officials were the Roman governors magistrates elected at Rome who in the name of the Roman people governed senatorial provinces or governors usually of equestrian rank who held their imperium on behalf of the emperor in imperial provinces most notably Roman Egypt.203 A governor had to make himself accessible to the people he governed but he could delegate various duties.204 His staff however was minimal his official attendants apparitores including lictors heralds messengers scribes and bodyguards legates both civil and military usually of equestrian rank and friends who accompanied him unofficially.204 Other officials were appointed as supervisors of government finances.21 Separating fiscal responsibility from justice and administration was a reform of the Imperial era to avoid provincial governors and tax farmers exploiting local populations for personal gain.205 Equestrian procurators whose authority was originally extrajudicial and extraconstitutional managed both stateowned property and the personal property of the emperor res privata.204 Because Roman government officials were few a provincial who needed help with a legal dispute or criminal case might seek out any Roman perceived to have some official capacity.206 Law Main article Roman law Roman portraiture frescos from Pompeii 
1 st century AD depicting two different men wearing laurel wreaths one holding the rotulus blondish figure left the other a volumen brunet figure right both made of papyrus Roman courts held original jurisdiction over cases involving Roman citizens throughout the empire but there were too few judicial functionaries to impose Roman law uniformly in the provinces. Most parts of the Eastern Empire already had wellestablished law codes and juridical procedures.95 Generally it was Roman policy to respect the mos regionis regional tradition or law of the land and to regard local laws as a source of legal precedent and social stability.95207 The compatibility of Roman and local law was thought to reflect an underlying ius gentium the law of nations or international law regarded as common and customary.208 If provincial law conflicted with Roman law or custom Roman courts heard appeals and the emperor held final decisionmaking authority.952
07 n In the West law had been administered on a highly localized or tribal basis and private property rights may have been a novelty of the Roman era particularly among Celts. Roman law facilitated the acquisition of wealth by a proRoman elite.95 The extension of universal citizenship to all free inhabitants of the Empire in 212 required the uniform application of Roman law replacing local law codes that had applied to noncitizens. Diocletians efforts to stabilize the Empire after the Crisis of the Third Century included two major compilations of law in four years the Codex Gregorianus and the Codex Hermogenianus to guide provincial administrators in setting consistent legal standards.209 The pervasiveness of Roman law throughout Western Europe enormously influenced the Western legal tradition reflected by continued use of Latin legal terminology in modern law.citation needed Taxation Further information Taxation in ancient Rome The Temple of Saturn a religious monument that housed the treasury in ancient Rome Taxation under the Empire amounted to about 5 of its gross product.210 The typical tax rate for individuals ranged from 2 to 
5.2 11 The tax code was bewildering in its complicated system of direct and indirect taxes some paid in cash and some in kind. Taxes might be specific to a province or kinds of properties such as fisheries they might be temporary.212 Tax collection was justified by the need to maintain the military213 and taxpayers sometimes got a refund if the army captured a surplus of booty.214 Inkind taxes were accepted from lessmonetized areas particularly those who could supply grain or goods to army camps.215 The primary source of direct tax revenue was individuals who paid a poll tax and a tax on their land construed as a tax on its produce or productive capacity.211 Tax obligations were determined by the census each head of household provided a headcount of his household as well as an accounting of his property.216 A major source of indirecttax revenue was the portoria customs and tolls on trade including among provinces.211 Towards the end of his reign Augustus instituted a 4 tax on the sale of slaves217 which Nero shifted from the purchaser to the dealers who responded by raising their prices.218 An owner who manumitted a slave paid a freedom tax calculated at 5 of value.o An inheritance tax of 5 was assessed when Roman citizens above a certain net worth left property to anyone outside their immediate family. Revenues from the estate tax and from an auction tax went towards the veterans pension fund aerarium militare.211 Low taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth which equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government. An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates of the superrich but in the later period the resistance of the wealthy to paying taxes was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of the Empire.53 Economy Main article Roman economy A green Roman glass cup unearthed from an Eastern Han dynasty 25220 AD tomb in Guangxi China The Empire is best thought of as a network of regional economies based on a form of political capitalism in which the state regulated commerce to assure its own revenues.219 Economic growth though not comparable to modern economies was greater than that of most other societies prior to industrialization.220 Territorial conquests permitted a largescale reorganization of land use that resulted in agricultural surplus and specialization particularly in north Africa.221 Some cities were known for particular industries. The scale of urban building indicates a significant construction industry.221 Papyri preserve complex accounting methods that suggest elements of economic rationalism221 and the Empire was highly monetized.222 Although the means of communication and transport were limited in antiquity transportation in the 
1 st and 
2 nd centuries expanded greatly and trade routes connected regional economies.223 The supply contracts for the army drew on local suppliers near the base castrum throughout the province and across provincial borders.224 Economic historians vary in their calculations of the gross domestic product during the Principate.225 In the sample years of 14 100 and 150 AD estimates of per capita GDP range from 166 to 380 HS. The GDP per capita of Italy is estimated as 40226 to 66227 higher than in the rest of the Empire due to tax transfers from the provinces and the concentration of elite income. Economic dynamism resulted in social mobility. Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society wealth requirements for rank indicate a strong tendency towards plutocracy. Prestige could be obtained through investing ones wealth in grand estates or townhouses luxury items public entertainments funerary monuments and religious dedications. Guilds collegia and corporations corpora provided support for individuals to succeed through networking.163 There can be little doubt that the lower classes of ... provincial towns of the Roman Empire enjoyed a high standard of living not equaled again in Western Europe until the 
19 th century.228 Households in the top 
1.5  of income distribution captured about 20 of income. The vast majority produced more than half of the total income but lived near subsistence.229 Currency and banking See also Roman currency and Roman finance Sestertius issued under Hadrian circa AD 134138 Solidus issued under Constantine II and on the reverse Victoria one of the last deities to appear on Roman coins gradually transforming into an angel under Christian rule230 The early Empire was monetized to a nearuniversal extent using money as a way to express prices and debts.231 The sestertius English sesterces symbolized as HS was the basic unit of reckoning value into the 
4 th century232 though the silver denarius worth four sesterces was also used beginning in the Severan dynasty.233 The smallest coin commonly circulated was the bronze as onetenth denarius.234 Bullion and ingots seem not to have counted as pecunia money and were used only on the frontiers. Romans in the first and second centuries counted coins rather than weighing theman indication that the coin was valued on its face. This tendency towards fiat money led to the debasement of Roman coinage in the later Empire.235 The standardization of money throughout the Empire promoted trade and market integration.231 The high amount of metal coinage in circulation increased the money supply for trading or saving.236 Rome had no central bank and regulation of the banking system was minimal. Banks of classical antiquity typically kept less in reserves than the full total of customers deposits. A typical bank had fairly limited capital and often only one principal. Seneca assumes that anyone involved in Roman commerce needs access to credit.235 A professional deposit banker received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term and lent money to third parties. The senatorial elite were involved heavily in private lending both as creditors and borrowers.237 The holder of a debt could use it as a means of payment by transferring it to another party without cash changing hands. Although it has sometimes been thought that ancient Rome lacked documentary transactions the system of banks throughout the Empire permitted the exchange of large sums without physically transferring coins in part because of the risks of moving large amounts of cash. Only one serious credit shortage is known to have occurred in the early Empire in 33 AD238 generally available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers.235 The central government itself did not borrow money and without public debt had to fund deficits from cash reserves.239 Emperors of the Antonine and Severan dynasties debased the currency particularly the denarius under the pressures of meeting military payrolls.232 Sudden inflation under Commodus damaged the credit market.235 In the mid2
00 s the supply of specie contracted sharply.232 Conditions during the Crisis of the Third Centurysuch as reductions in longdistance trade disruption of mining operations and the physical transfer of gold coinage outside the empire by invading enemiesgreatly diminished the money supply and the banking sector.232235 Although Roman coinage had long been fiat money or fiduciary currency general economic anxieties came to a head under Aurelian and bankers lost confidence in coins. Despite Diocletians introduction of the gold solidus and monetary reforms the credit market of the Empire never recovered its former robustness.235 Mining and metallurgy Main articles Mining in ancient Rome and Roman metallurgy Landscape resulting from the ruina montium mining technique at Las Mdulas Spain one of the most important gold mines in the Roman Empire The main mining regions of the Empire were the Iberian Peninsula gold silver copper tin lead Gaul gold silver iron Britain mainly iron lead tin the Danubian provinces gold iron Macedonia and Thrace gold silver and Asia Minor gold silver iron tin.citation needed Intensive largescale miningof alluvial deposits and by means of opencast mining and underground miningtook place from the reign of Augustus up to the early 
3 rd century when the instability of the Empire disrupted production.citation needed Hydraulic mining allowed base and precious metals to be extracted on a protoindustrial scale.240 The total annual iron output is estimated at 82500 tonnes.241 Copper and lead production levels were unmatched until the Industrial Revolution.242243244245 At its peak around the mid
2 nd century the Roman silver stock is estimated at 10000 t five to ten times larger than the combined silver mass of medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800 AD.244246 As an indication of the scale of Roman metal production lead pollution in the Greenland ice sheet quadrupled over prehistoric levels during the Imperial era and dropped thereafter.247 Transportation and communication Further information Cursus publicus The Tabula Peutingeriana Latin for The Peutinger Map an Itinerarium often assumed to be based on the Roman cursus publicus The Empire completely encircled the Mediterranean which they called our sea Mare Nostrum.248 Roman sailing vessels navigated the Mediterranean as well as major rivers.56 Transport by water was preferred where possible as moving commodities by land was more difficult.249 Vehicles wheels and ships indicate the existence of a great number of skilled woodworkers.250 Land transport utilized the advanced system of Roman roads called viae. These roads were primarily built for military purposes251 but also served commercial ends. The inkind taxes paid by communities included the provision of personnel animals or vehicles for the cursus publicus the state mail and transport service established by Augustus.215 Relay stations were located along the roads every seven to twelve Roman miles and tended to grow into villages or trading posts.252 A mansio plural mansiones was a privately run service station franchised by the imperial bureaucracy for the cursus publicus. The distance between mansiones was determined by how far a wagon could travel in a day.252 Carts were usually pulled by mules travelling about 4 mph.253 Trade and commodities See also Roman commerce IndoRoman trade relations and SinoRoman relations Roman provinces traded among themselves but trade extended outside the frontiers to regions as far away as China and India.254 Chinese trade was mostly conducted overland through middle men along the Silk Road Indian trade also occurred by sea from Egyptian ports. The main commodity was grain.255 Also traded were olive oil foodstuffs garum fish sauce slaves ore and manufactured metal objects fibres and textiles timber pottery glassware marble papyrus spices and materia medica ivory pearls and gemstones.256 Though most provinces could produce wine regional varietals were desirable and wine was a central trade good.257 Labour and occupations Workers at a clothprocessing shop in a painting from the fullonica of Veranius Hypsaeus in Pompeii Inscriptions record 268 different occupations in Rome and 85 in Pompeii.195 Professional associations or trade guilds collegia are attested for a wide range of occupations some quite specialized.163 Work performed by slaves falls into five general categories domestic with epitaphs recording at least 55 different household jobs imperial or public service urban crafts and services agriculture and mining. Convicts provided much of the labour in the mines or quarries where conditions were notoriously brutal.258 In practice there was little division of labour between slave and free95 and most workers were illiterate and without special skills.259 The greatest number of common labourers were employed in agriculture in Italian industrial farming latifundia these may have been mostly slaves but elsewhere slave farm labour was probably less important.95 Textile and clothing production was a major source of employment. Both textiles and finished garments were traded and products were often named for peoples or towns like a fashion label.260 Better readytowear was exported by local businessmen negotiatores or mercatores.261 Finished garments might be retailed by their sales agents by vestiarii clothing dealers or peddled by itinerant merchants.261 The fullers fullones and dye workers coloratores had their own guilds.262 Centonarii were guild workers who specialized in textile production and the recycling of old clothes into pieced goods.p Recreation of a deer hunt inspired by hunting scenes represented in Roman art. Architecture and engineering Main articles Ancient Roman architecture Roman engineering and Roman technology The Flavian Amphitheatre more commonly known as the Colosseum The chief Roman contributions to architecture were the arch vault and dome. Some Roman structures still stand today due in part to sophisticated methods of making cements and concrete.265 Roman temples developed Etruscan and Greek forms with some distinctive elements. Roman roads are considered the most advanced built until the early 
19 th century. The system of roadways facilitated military policing communications and trade and were resistant to floods and other environmental hazards. Some remained usable for over a thousand years.citation needed Roman bridges were among the first large and lasting bridges built from stone and in most cases concrete with the arch as the basic structure. The largest Roman bridge was Trajans bridge over the lower Danube constructed by Apollodorus of Damascus which remained for over a millennium the longest bridge to have been built.266 The Romans built many dams and reservoirs for water collection such as the Subiaco Dams two of which fed the Anio Novus one of the largest aqueducts of Rome.267 The Pont du Gard aqueduct which crosses the river Gardon in southern France is on UNESCOs list of World Heritage Sites. The Romans constructed numerous aqueducts. De aquaeductu a treatise by Frontinus who served as water commissioner reflects the administrative importance placed on the water supply. Masonry channels carried water along a precise gradient using gravity alone. It was then collected in tanks and fed through pipes to public fountains baths toilets or industrial sites.268 The main aqueducts in Rome were the Aqua Claudia and the Aqua Marcia.269 The complex system built to supply Constantinople had its most distant supply drawn from over 120 km away along a route of more than 336 km.270 Roman aqueducts were built to remarkably fine tolerance and to a technological standard not equalled until modern times.271 The Romans also used aqueducts in their extensive mining operations across the empire.272 Insulated glazing or double glazing was used in the construction of public baths. Elite housing in cooler climates might have hypocausts a form of central heating. The Romans were the first culture to assemble all essential components of the much later steam engine the crank and connecting rod system Heros aeolipile generating steam power the cylinder and piston in metal force pumps nonreturn valves in water pumps and gearing in water mills and clocks.273 Daily life Main article Culture of ancient Rome Cityscape from the Villa Boscoreale 
60 s AD City and country The city was viewed as fostering civilization by being properly designed ordered and adorned.274 Augustus undertook a vast building programme in Rome supported public displays of art that expressed imperial ideology and reorganized the city into neighbourhoods vici administered at the local level with police and firefighting services.275 A focus of Augustan monumental architecture was the Campus Martius an open area outside the city centre the Altar of Augustan Peace Ara Pacis Augustae was located there as was an obelisk imported from Egypt that formed the pointer gnomon of a horologium. With its public gardens the Campus was among the most attractive places in Rome to visit.275 City planning and urban lifestyles was influenced by the Greeks early on276 and in the Eastern Empire Roman rule shaped the development of cities that already had a strong Hellenistic character. Cities such as Athens Aphrodisias Ephesus and Gerasa tailored city planning and architecture to imperial ideals while expressing their individual identity and regional preeminence.277 In areas inhabited by Celticspeaking peoples Rome encouraged the development of urban centres with stone temples forums monumental fountains and amphitheatres often on or near the sites of preexisting walled settlements known as oppida.2782
79 q Urbanization in Roman Africa expanded on Greek and Punic coastal cities.252 Aquae Sulis in Bath England architectural features above the level of the pillar bases are a later reconstruction. The network of cities coloniae municipia civitates or in Greek terms poleis was a primary cohesive force during the Pax Romana.184 Romans of the 
1 st and 
2 nd centuries were encouraged to inculcate the habits of peacetime.281 As the classicist Clifford Ando noted Most of the cultural appurtenances popularly associated with imperial culturepublic cult and its games and civic banquets competitions for artists speakers and athletes as well as the funding of the great majority of public buildings and public display of artwere financed by private individuals whose expenditures in this regard helped to justify their economic power and legal and provincial privileges.282 Public toilets latrinae from Ostia Antica In the city of Rome most people lived in multistory apartment buildings insulae that were often squalid firetraps. Public facilitiessuch as baths thermae toilets with running water latrinae basins or elaborate fountains nymphea delivering fresh water279 and largescale entertainments such as chariot races and gladiator combatwere aimed primarily at the common people.283 Similar facilities were constructed in cities throughout the Empire and some of the bestpreserved Roman structures are in Spain southern France and northern Africa.citation needed The public baths served hygienic social and cultural functions.284 Bathing was the focus of daily socializing.285 Roman baths were distinguished by a series of rooms that offered communal bathing in three temperatures with amenities that might include an exercise room sauna exfoliation spa ball court or outdoor swimming pool. Baths had hypocaust heating the floors were suspended over hotair channels.286 Public baths were part of urban culture throughout the provinces but in the late 
4 th century individual tubs began to replace communal bathing. Christians were advised to go to the baths only for hygiene.287 Reconstructed peristyle garden based on the House of the Vettii Rich families from Rome usually had two or more houses a townhouse domus and at least one luxury home villa outside the city. The domus was a privately owned singlefamily house and might be furnished with a private bath balneum286 but it was not a place to retreat from public life.288 Although some neighbourhoods show a higher concentration of such houses they were not segregated enclaves. The domus was meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the paterfamilias head of household met with clients every morning.275 It was a centre of family religious rites containing a shrine and images of family ancestors.289 The houses were located on busy public roads and groundlevel spaces were often rented out as shops tabernae.290 In addition to a kitchen gardenwindowboxes might substitute in the insulaetownhouses typically enclosed a peristyle garden.291 The villa by contrast was an escape from the city and in literature represents a lifestyle that balances intellectual and artistic interests otium with an appreciation of nature and agriculture.292 Ideally a villa commanded a view or vista carefully framed by the architectural design.293 It might be located on a working estate or in a resort town on the seacoast.citation needed Augustus programme of urban renewal and the growth of Romes population to as many as one million was accompanied by nostalgia for rural life. Poetry idealized the lives of farmers and shepherds. Interior decorating often featured painted gardens fountains landscapes vegetative ornament293 and animals rendered accurately enough to be identified by species.294 On a more practical level the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture.295 Producing food was the priority of land use.296 Larger farms latifundia achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life.295 Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire and new crops were introduced from one province to another.297 Bread stall from a Pompeiian wall painting Maintaining an affordable food supply to the city of Rome had become a major political issue in the late Republic when the state began to provide a grain dole Cura Annonae to citizens who registered for it295 about 200000250000 adult males in Rome.298 The dole cost at least 15 of state revenues295 but improved living conditions among the lower classes299 and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on estates.295 The grain dole also had symbolic value it affirmed the emperors position as universal benefactor and the right of citizens to share in the fruits of conquest.295 The annona public facilities and spectacular entertainments mitigated the otherwise dreary living conditions of lowerclass Romans and kept social unrest in check. The satirist Juvenal however saw bread and circuses panem et circenses as emblematic of the loss of republican political liberty300 The public has long since cast off its cares the people that once bestowed commands consulships legions and all else now meddles no more and longs eagerly for just two things bread and circuses.301 Health and disease Further information Disease in Imperial Rome Antonine plague and Plague of Cyprian Epidemics were common in the ancient world and occasional pandemics in the Empire killed millions. The Roman population was unhealthy. About 20 percenta large percentage by ancient standardslived in cities Rome being the largest. The cities were a demographic sink the death rate exceeded the birth rate and constant immigration was necessary to maintain the population. Average lifespan is estimated at the midtwenties and perhaps more than half of children died before reaching adulthood. Dense urban populations and poor sanitation contributed to disease. Land and sea connections facilitated and sped the transfer of infectious diseases across the empires territories. The rich were not immune only two of emperor Marcus Aureliuss fourteen children are known to have reached adulthood.302 The importance of a good diet to health was recognized by medical writers such as Galen 
2 nd century. Views on nutrition were influenced by beliefs like humoral theory.303 A good indicator of nutrition and disease burden is average height the average Roman was shorter in stature than the population of preRoman Italian societies and medieval Europe.304 Food and dining Main article Food and dining in the Roman Empire See also Ancient Roman cuisine and Ancient Rome and wine Still life on a 
2 ndcentury Roman mosaic Most apartments in Rome lacked kitchens though a charcoal brazier could be used for rudimentary cookery.305 Prepared food was sold at pubs and bars inns and food stalls tabernae cauponae popinae thermopolia.306 Carryout and restaurants were for the lower classes fine dining appeared only at dinner parties in wealthy homes with a chef archimagirus and kitchen staff307 or banquets hosted by social clubs collegia.308 Most Romans consumed at least 70 of their daily calories in the form of cereals and legumes.309 Puls pottage was considered the food of the Romans310 and could be elaborated to produce dishes similar to polenta or risotto.311 Urban populations and the military preferred bread.309 By the reign of Aurelian the state had begun to distribute the annona as a daily ration of bread baked in state factories and added olive oil wine and pork to the dole.312 Roman literature focuses on the dining habits of the upper classes313 for whom the evening meal cena had important social functions.314 Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room triclinium furnished with couches. By the late Republic women dined reclined and drank wine along with men.315 The poet Martial describes a dinner beginning with the gustatio tasting or appetizer salad. The main course was kid beans greens a chicken and leftover ham followed by a dessert of fruit and wine.316 Roman foodies indulged in wild game fowl such as peacock and flamingo large fish mullet was especially prized and shellfish. Luxury ingredients were imported from the far reaches of empire.317 A booklength collection of Roman recipes is attributed to Apicius a name for several figures in antiquity that became synonymous with gourmet.318 Refined cuisine could be moralized as a sign of either civilized progress or decadent decline.319 Most often because of the importance of landowning in Roman culture producecereals legumes vegetables and fruitwere considered more civilized foods than meat. The Mediterranean staples of bread wine and oil were sacralized by Roman Christianity while Germanic meat consumption became a mark of paganism.320 Some philosophers and Christians resisted the demands of the body and the pleasures of food and adopted fasting as an ideal.321 Food became simpler in general as urban life in the West diminished and trade routes were disrupted322 the Church formally discouraged gluttony323 and hunting and pastoralism were seen as simple and virtuous.322 Spectacles See also Ludi Chariot racing and Recitationes A victor in his fourhorse chariot When Juvenal complained that the Roman people had exchanged their political liberty for bread and circuses he was referring to the stateprovided grain dole and the circenses events held in the entertainment venue called a circus. The largest such venue in Rome was the Circus Maximus the setting of horse races chariot races the equestrian Troy Game staged beast hunts venationes athletic contests gladiator combat and historical reenactments. From earliest times several religious festivals had featured games ludi primarily horse and chariot races ludi circenses.324 The races retained religious significance in connection with agriculture initiation and the cycle of birth and death.r Under Augustus public entertainments were presented on 77 days of the year by the reign of Marcus Aurelius this had expanded to 1
35.3 26 Circus games were preceded by an elaborate parade pompa circensis that ended at the venue.327 Competitive events were held also in smaller venues such as the amphitheatre which became the characteristic Roman spectacle venue and stadium. Greekstyle athletics included footraces boxing wrestling and the pancratium.328 Aquatic displays such as the mock sea battle naumachia and a form of water ballet were presented in engineered pools.329 Statesupported theatrical events ludi scaenici took place on temple steps or in grand stone theatres or in the smaller enclosed theatre called an odeon.330 Circuses were the largest structure regularly built in the Roman world.331 The Flavian Amphitheatre better known as the Colosseum became the regular arena for blood sports in Rome.332 Many Roman amphitheatres circuses and theatres built in cities outside Italy are visible as ruins today.332 The local ruling elite were responsible for sponsoring spectacles and arena events which both enhanced their status and drained their resources.167 The physical arrangement of the amphitheatre represented the order of Roman society the emperor in his opulent box senators and equestrians in reserved advantageous seats women seated at a remove from the action slaves given the worst places and everybody else inbetween.333 The crowd could call for an outcome by booing or cheering but the emperor had the final say. Spectacles could quickly become sites of social and political protest and emperors sometimes had to deploy force to put down crowd unrest most notoriously at the Nika riots in 5

Fan loyalty was fierce and at times erupted into sports riots.336 Racing was perilous but charioteers were among the most celebrated and wellcompensated athletes.337 Circuses were designed to ensure that no team had an unfair advantage and to minimize collisions naufragia338 which were nonetheless frequent and satisfying to the crowd.339 The races retained a magical aura through their early association with chthonic rituals circus images were considered protective or lucky curse tablets have been found buried at the site of racetracks and charioteers were often suspected of sorcery.340 Chariot racing continued into the Byzantine period under imperial sponsorship but the decline of cities in the 
6 th and 
7 th centuries led to its eventual demise.331 The Romans thought gladiator contests had originated with funeral games and sacrifices. Some of the earliest styles of gladiator fighting had ethnic designations such as Thracian or Gallic.341 The staged combats were considered munera services offerings benefactions initially distinct from the festival games ludi.342 To mark the opening of the Colosseum Titus presented 100 days of arena events with 3000 gladiators competing on a single day.343 Roman fascination with gladiators is indicated by how widely they are depicted on mosaics wall paintings lamps and in graffiti.344 Gladiators were trained combatants who might be slaves convicts or free volunteers.345 Death was not a necessary or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters whose training was costly and timeconsuming.346 By contrast noxii were convicts sentenced to the arena with little or no training often unarmed and with no expectation of survival physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice.167 These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as reenactments of myths and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects.167347 Modern scholars have found the pleasure Romans took in the theatre of life and death348 difficult to understand.349 Pliny the Younger rationalized gladiator spectacles as good for the people to inspire them to face honourable wounds and despise death by exhibiting love of glory and desire for victory.350 Some Romans such as Seneca were critical of the brutal spectacles but found virtue in the courage and dignity of the defeated fighter3
51 an attitude that finds its fullest expression with the Christians martyred in the arena. Tertullian considered deaths in the arena to be nothing more than a dressedup form of human sacrifice.352 Even martyr literature however offers detailed indeed luxuriant descriptions of bodily suffering353 and became a popular genre at times indistinguishable from fiction.354 Recreation Socalled Bikini Girls mosaic from the Villa del Casale Roman Sicily 
4 th century The singular ludus play game sport training had a wide range of meanings such as word play theatrical performance board game primary school and even gladiator training school as in Ludus Magnus.355 Activities for children and young people in the Empire included hoop rolling and knucklebones astragali or jacks. Girls had dolls made of wood terracotta and especially bone and ivory.356 Ball games include trigon and harpastum.357 People of all ages played board games including latrunculi Raiders and XII scripta Twelve Marks.358 A game referred to as alea dice or tabula the board may have been similar to backgammon.359 Dicing as a form of gambling was disapproved of but was a popular pastime during the festival of the Saturnalia.citation needed After adolescence most physical training for males was of a military nature. The Campus Martius originally was an exercise field where young men learned horsemanship and warfare. Hunting was also considered an appropriate pastime. According to Plutarch conservative Romans disapproved of Greekstyle athletics that promoted a fine body for its own sake and condemned Neros efforts to encourage Greekstyle athletic games.360 Some women trained as gymnasts and dancers and a rare few as female gladiators. The Bikini Girls mosaic shows young women engaging in routines comparable to rhythmic gymnastics.s362 Women were encouraged to maintain health through activities such as playing ball swimming walking or reading aloud as a breathing exercise.363 Clothing Main article Clothing in ancient Rome Further information Roman hairstyles Roman jewelry and Cosmetics in ancient Rome Togate statue in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale dAbruzzo In a statusconscious society like that of the Romans clothing and personal adornment indicated the etiquette of interacting with the wearer.364 Wearing the correct clothing reflected a society in good order.365 There is little direct evidence of how Romans dressed in daily life since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value and surviving textiles are rare.366367 The toga was the distinctive national garment of the male citizen but it was heavy and impractical worn mainly for conducting political or court business and religious rites.368366 It was a vast expanse of semicircular white wool that could not be put on and draped correctly without assistance.368 The drapery became more intricate and structured over time.369 The toga praetexta with a purple or purplishred stripe representing inviolability was worn by children who had not come of age curule magistrates and state priests. Only the emperor could wear an allpurple toga toga picta.370 Ordinary clothing was dark or colourful. The basic garment for all Romans regardless of gender or wealth was the simple sleeved tunic with length differing by wearer.371 The tunics of poor people and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural dull shades finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man of the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes clavi woven vertically the wider the stripe the higher the wearers status.371 Other garments could be layered over the tunic. Common male attire also included cloaks and in some regions trousers.372 In the 
2 nd century emperors and elite men are often portrayed wearing the pallium an originally Greek mantle women are also portrayed in the pallium. Tertullian considered the pallium an appropriate garment both for Christians in contrast to the toga and for educated people.365366373 Roman clothing styles changed over time.374 In the Dominate clothing worn by both soldiers and bureaucrats became highly decorated with geometrical patterns stylized plant motifs and in more elaborate examples human or animal figures.375 Courtiers of the later Empire wore elaborate silk robes. The militarization of Roman society and the waning of urban life affected fashion heavy militarystyle belts were worn by bureaucrats as well as soldiers and the toga was abandoned376 replaced by the pallium as a garment embodying social unity.377 Arts Main articles Roman art and Art collection in ancient Rome Greek art had a profound influence on Roman art.378 Public artincluding sculpture monuments such as victory columns or triumphal arches and the iconography on coinsis often analysed for historical or ideological significance.379 In the private sphere artistic objects were made for religious dedications funerary commemoration domestic use and commerce.380 The wealthy advertised their appreciation of culture through artwork and decorative arts in their homes.381 Despite the value placed on art even famous artists were of low social status partly as they worked with their hands.382 Portraiture Main article Roman portraiture Two portraits c.130 AD the empress Vibia Sabina left and the Antinous Mondragone Portraiture which survives mainly in sculpture was the most copious form of imperial art. Portraits during the Augustan period utilize classical proportions evolving later into a mixture of realism and idealism.383 Republican portraits were characterized by verism but as early as the 
2 nd century BC Greek heroic nudity was adopted for conquering generals.384 Imperial portrait sculptures may model a mature head atop a youthful nude or seminude body with perfect musculature.385 Clothed in the toga or military regalia the body communicates rank or role not individual characteristics.386 Women of the emperors family were often depicted as goddesses or divine personifications.citation needed Portraiture in painting is represented primarily by the Fayum mummy portraits which evoke Egyptian and Roman traditions of commemorating the dead with realistic painting. Marble portrait sculpture were painted but traces have rarely survived.387 Sculpture and sarcophagi Main articles Roman sculpture and Ancient Roman sarcophagi On the Ludovisi sarcophagus Examples of Roman sculpture survive abundantly though often in damaged or fragmentary condition including freestanding statuary in marble bronze and terracotta and reliefs from public buildings and monuments. Niches in amphitheatres were originally filled with statues388389 as were formal gardens.390 Temples housed cult images of deities often by famed sculptors.391 Elaborately carved marble and limestone sarcophagi are characteristic of the 
2 nd to 
4 th centuries.392 Sarcophagus relief has been called the richest single source of Roman iconography393 depicting mythological scenes394 or JewishChristian imagery395 as well as the deceaseds life. Painting Main article Painting in ancient Rome The Wedding of Zephyrus and Chloris 5468 AD Pompeian Fourth Style within painted architectural panels from the Casa del Naviglio Initial Roman painting drew from Etruscan and Greek models and techniques. Examples of Roman paintings can be found in palaces catacombs and villas. Much of what is known of Roman painting is from the interior decoration of private homes particularly as preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius. In addition to decorative borders and panels with geometric or vegetative motifs wall painting depicts scenes from mythology and theatre landscapes and gardens spectacles everyday life and erotic art.citation needed Mosaic Main article Roman mosaic The Triumph of Neptune floor mosaic from Africa Proconsularis presentday Tunisia396 Mosaics are among the most enduring of Roman decorative arts and are found on floors and other architectural features. The most common is the tessellated mosaic formed from uniform pieces tesserae of materials such as stone and glass.397 Opus sectile is a related technique in which flat stone usually coloured marble is cut precisely into shapes from which geometric or figurative patterns are formed. This more difficult technique became especially popular for luxury surfaces in the 
4 th century e.g. the Basilica of Junius Bassus.398 Figurative mosaics share many themes with painting and in some cases use almost identical compositions. Geometric patterns and mythological scenes occur throughout the Empire. In North Africa a particularly rich source of mosaics homeowners often chose scenes of life on their estates hunting agriculture and local wildlife.396 Plentiful and major examples of Roman mosaics come also from presentday Turkey particularly the Antioch mosaics399 Italy southern France Spain and Portugal. Decorative arts Further information Ancient Roman pottery and Roman glass Decorative arts for luxury consumers included fine pottery silver and bronze vessels and implements and glassware. Pottery manufacturing was economically important as were the glass and metalworking industries. Imports stimulated new regional centres of production.

4 th century Performing arts Main articles Theatre of ancient Rome and Music of ancient Rome Allmale theatrical troupe preparing for a masked performance on a mosaic from the House of the Tragic Poet In Roman tradition borrowed from the Greeks literary theatre was performed by allmale troupes that used face masks with exaggerated facial expressions to portray emotion. Female roles were played by men in drag travesti. Roman literary theatre tradition is particularly well represented in Latin literature by the tragedies of Seneca.citation needed More popular than literary theatre was the genredefying mimus theatre which featured scripted scenarios with free improvisation risqu language and sex scenes action sequences and political satire along with dance juggling acrobatics tightrope walking striptease and dancing bears.402 Unlike literary theatre mimus was played without masks and encouraged stylistic realism. Female roles were performed by women.403 Mimus was related to pantomimus an early form of story ballet that contained no spoken dialogue but rather a sung libretto often mythological either tragic or comic.404 Trio of musicians playing an aulos cymbala and tympanum mosaic from Pompeii Although sometimes regarded as foreign music and dance existed in Rome from earliest times.405 Music was customary at funerals and the tibia a woodwind instrument was played at sacrifices.406 Song carmen was integral to almost every social occasion. Music was thought to reflect the orderliness of the cosmos.407 Various woodwinds and brass instruments were played as were stringed instruments such as the cithara and percussion.406 The cornu a long tubular metal wind instrument was used for military signals and on parade.406 These instruments spread throughout the provinces and are widely depicted in Roman art.408 The hydraulic pipe organ hydraulis was one of the most significant technical and musical achievements of antiquity and accompanied gladiator games and events in the amphitheatre.406 Although certain dances were seen at times as nonRoman or unmanly dancing was embedded in religious rituals of archaic Rome.409 Ecstatic dancing was a feature of the mystery religions particularly the cults of Cybele410 and Isis. In the secular realm dancing girls from Syria and Cadiz were extremely popular.411 Like gladiators entertainers were legally infames technically free but little better than slaves. Stars however could enjoy considerable wealth and celebrity and mingled socially and often sexually with the elite.412 Performers supported each other by forming guilds and several memorials for theatre members survive.413 Theatre and dance were often condemned by Christian polemicists in the later Empire.405414 Literacy books and education Pride in literacy was displayed through emblems of reading and writing as in this portrait of Terentius Neo and his wife c. 20 AD Estimates of the average literacy rate range from 5 to over 
30.4 15416417 The Roman obsession with documents and inscriptions indicates the value placed on the written word.4184
19 t Laws and edicts were posted as well as read out. Illiterate Roman subjects could have a government scribe scriba read or write their official documents for them.416421 The military produced extensive written records.422 The Babylonian Talmud declared if all seas were ink all reeds were pen all skies parchment and all men scribes they would be unable to set down the full scope of the Roman governments concerns.423 Numeracy was necessary for commerce.419424 Slaves were numerate and literate in significant numbers some were highly educated.425 Graffiti and lowquality inscriptions with misspellings and solecisms indicate casual literacy among nonelites.4
26 u84 The Romans had an extensive priestly archive and inscriptions appear throughout the Empire in connection with votives dedicated by ordinary people as well as magic spells e.g. the Greek Magical Papyri.427 Books were expensive since each copy had to be written out on a papyrus roll volumen by scribes.428 The codexpages bound to a spinewas still a novelty in the 
1 st century429 but by the end of the 
3 rd century was replacing the volumen.430 Commercial book production was established by the late Republic431 and by the 
1 st century certain neighbourhoods of Rome and Western provincial cities were known for their bookshops.432 The quality of editing varied wildly433 and plagiarism or forgery were common since there was no copyright law.431 Reconstruction of a wax writing tablet Collectors amassed personal libraries434 and a fine library was part of the cultivated leisure otium associated with the villa lifestyle.435 Significant collections might attract inhouse scholars436 and an individual benefactor might endow a community with a library as Pliny the Younger did in Comum.437 Imperial libraries were open to users on a limited basis and represented a literary canon.438 Books considered subversive might be publicly burned439 and Domitian crucified copyists for reproducing works deemed treasonous.440 Literary texts were often shared aloud at meals or with reading groups.441 Public readings recitationes expanded from the 
1 st through the 
3 rd century giving rise to consumer literature for entertainment.442 Illustrated books including erotica were popular but are poorly represented by extant fragments.443 Literacy began to decline during the Crisis of the Third Century.444 The emperor Julian banned Christians from teaching the classical curriculum445 but the Church Fathers and other Christians adopted Latin and Greek literature philosophy and science in biblical interpretation.446 As the Western Roman Empire declined reading became rarer even for those within the Church hierarchy447 although it continued in the Byzantine Empire.448 Education Main article Education in ancient Rome A teacher with two students as a third arrives with his loculus a writing case449 Traditional Roman education was moral and practical. Stories were meant to instil Roman values mores maiorum. Parents were expected to act as role models and working parents passed their skills to their children who might also enter apprenticeships.450 Young children were attended by a pedagogue usually a Greek slave or former slave451 who kept the child safe taught selfdiscipline and public behaviour attended class and helped with tutoring.452 Formal education was available only to families who could pay for it lack of state support contributed to low literacy.453 Primary education in reading writing and arithmetic might take place at home if parents hired or bought a teacher.454 Other children attended public schools organized by a schoolmaster ludimagister paid by parents.455 Vernae homeborn slave children might share inhome or public schooling.456 Boys and girls received primary education generally from ages 7 to 12 but classes were not segregated by grade or age.457 Most schools employed corporal punishment.458 For the socially ambitious education in Greek as well as Latin was necessary.459 Schools became more numerous during the Empire increasing educational opportunities.459 Mosaic from Pompeii depicting the Academy of Plato At the age of 14 upperclass males made their rite of passage into adulthood and began to learn leadership roles through mentoring from a senior family member or family friend.460 Higher education was provided by grammatici or rhetores.461 The grammaticus or grammarian taught mainly Greek and Latin literature with history geography philosophy or mathematics treated as explications of the text.462 With the rise of Augustus contemporary Latin authors such as Virgil and Livy also became part of the curriculum.463 The rhetor was a teacher of oratory or public speaking. The art of speaking ars dicendi was highly prized and eloquentia speaking ability eloquence was considered the glue of civilized society.464 Rhetoric was not so much a body of knowledge though it required a command of the literary canon465 as it was a mode of expression that distinguished those who held social power.466 The ancient model of rhetorical trainingrestraint coolness under pressure modesty and good humour4
67 endured into the 
18 th century as a Western educational ideal.468 In Latin illiteratus could mean both unable to read and write and lacking in cultural awareness or sophistication.469 Higher education promoted career advancement.470 Urban elites throughout the Empire shared a literary culture imbued with Greek educational ideals paideia.471 Hellenistic cities sponsored schools of higher learning to express cultural achievement.472 Young Roman men often went abroad to study rhetoric and philosophy mostly to Athens. The curriculum in the East was more likely to include music and physical training.473 On the Hellenistic model Vespasian endowed chairs of grammar Latin and Greek rhetoric and philosophy at Rome and gave secondary teachers special exemptions from taxes and legal penalties.474 In the Eastern Empire Berytus presentday Beirut was unusual in offering a Latin education and became famous for its school of Roman law.475 The cultural movement known as the Second Sophistic 
1 st
3 rd century AD promoted the assimilation of Greek and Roman social educational and esthetic values.476 Literate women ranged from cultured aristocrats to girls trained to be calligraphers and scribes.477478 The ideal woman in Augustan love poetry was educated and wellversed in the arts.479 Education seems to have been standard for daughters of the senatorial and equestrian orders.456 An educated wife was an asset for the socially ambitious household.477 Literature Main article Latin literature See also Latin poetry Statue in Constana Romania the ancient colony Tomis commemorating Ovids exile Literature under Augustus along with that of the Republic has been viewed as the Golden Age of Latin literature embodying classical ideals.480 The three most influential Classical Latin poetsVirgil Horace and Ovidbelong to this period. Virgils Aeneid was a national epic in the manner of the Homeric epics of Greece. Horace perfected the use of Greek lyric metres in Latin verse. Ovids erotic poetry was enormously popular but ran afoul of Augustan morality contributing to his exile. Ovids Metamorphoses wove together GrecoRoman mythology his versions of Greek myths became a primary source of later classical mythology and his work was hugely influential on medieval literature.481 Latin writers were immersed in Greek literary traditions and adapted its forms and content but Romans regarded satire as a genre in which they surpassed the Greeks. The early Principate produced the satirists Persius and Juvenal.citation needed The mid
1 st through mid
2 nd century has conventionally been called the Silver Age of Latin literature. The three leading writersSeneca Lucan and Petroniuscommitted suicide after incurring Neros displeasure. Epigrammatist and social observer Martial and the epic poet Statius whose poetry collection Silvae influenced Renaissance literature482 wrote during the reign of Domitian. Other authors of the Silver Age included Pliny the Elder author of the encyclopedic Natural History his nephew Pliny the Younger and the historian Tacitus. The principal Latin prose author of the Augustan age is the historian Livy whose account of Romes founding became the most familiar version in modernera literature. The Twelve Caesars by Suetonius is a primary source for imperial biography. Among Imperial historians who wrote in Greek are Dionysius of Halicarnassus Josephus and Cassius Dio. Other major Greek authors of the Empire include the biographer Plutarch the geographer Strabo and the rhetorician and satirist Lucian.citation needed From the 
2 nd to the 
4 th centuries Christian authors were in active dialogue with the classical tradition. Tertullian was one of the earliest prose authors with a distinctly Christian voice. After the conversion of Constantine Latin literature is dominated by the Christian perspective.483 In the late 
4 th century Jerome produced the Latin translation of the Bible that became authoritative as the Vulgate. Augustine in The City of God against the Pagans builds a vision of an eternal spiritual Rome a new imperium sine fine that will outlast the collapsing Empire.citation needed In contrast to the unity of Classical Latin the literary esthetic of late antiquity has a tessellated quality.484 A continuing interest in the religious traditions of Rome prior to Christian dominion is found into the 
5 th century with the Saturnalia of Macrobius and The Marriage of Philology and Mercury of Martianus Capella. Prominent Latin poets of late antiquity include Ausonius Prudentius Claudian and Sidonius Apollinaris.citation needed Religion Main articles Religion in ancient Rome and Roman imperial cult See also History of the Jews in the Roman Empire Early Christianity Religious persecution in the Roman Empire and Christianization of the Roman Empire as diffusion of innovation A Roman priest his head ritually covered with a fold of his toga extends a patera in a gesture of libation

3 rd century The emperor Marcus Aurelius sacrificing at the Temple of Jupiter The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious and attributed their success to their collective piety pietas and good relations with the gods pax deorum. The archaic religion believed to have come from the earliest kings of Rome was the foundation of the mos maiorum the way of the ancestors central to Roman identity.485 The priesthoods of the state religion were filled from the same pool of men who held public office and the Pontifex Maximus was the emperor.citation needed Roman religion was practical and contractual based on the principle of do ut des I give that you might give. Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer ritual and sacrifice not on faith or dogma although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine. For ordinary Romans religion was a part of daily life.486 Each home had a household shrine to offer prayers and libations to the familys domestic deities. Neighbourhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances as many as 135 days were devoted to religious festivals and games ludi.487 In the wake of the Republics collapse state religion adapted to support the new regime. Augustus justified oneman rule with a vast programme of religious revivalism and reform. Public vows now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor. Socalled emperor worship expanded on a grand scale the traditional veneration of the ancestral dead and of the Genius the divine tutelary of every individual. Upon death an emperor could be made a state divinity divus by vote of the Senate. The Roman imperial cult influenced by Hellenistic ruler cult became one of the major ways Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity. Cultural precedent in the Eastern provinces facilitated a rapid dissemination of Imperial cult extending as far as Najran in presentday Saudi Arabia.v Rejection of the state religion became tantamount to treason. This was the context for Romes conflict with Christianity which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and superstitio.citation needed The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honoured. As the Romans extended their territories their general policy was to promote stability among diverse peoples by absorbing local deities and cults rather than eradicating themw building temples that framed local theology within Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the sidebyside worship of local and Roman deities including dedications made by Romans to local gods.489 By the height of the Empire numerous syncretic or reinterpreted gods were cultivated among them cults of Cybele Isis Epona and of solar gods such as Mithras and Sol Invictus found as far north as Roman Britain. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or cult only religious tolerance was not an issue.490 Mystery religions which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife were a matter of personal choice practiced in addition to ones family rites and public religion. The mysteries however involved exclusive oaths and secrecy which conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of magic conspiracy coniuratio and subversive activity. Thus sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists. In Gaul the power of the druids was checked first by forbidding Roman citizens to belong to the order and then by banning druidism altogether. However Celtic traditions were reinterpreted within the context of Imperial theology and a new GalloRoman religion coalesced its capital at the Sanctuary of the Three Gauls established precedent for Western cult as a form of Romanprovincial identity.491 The monotheistic rigour of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and granting of special exemptions. Tertullian noted that Judaism unlike Christianity was considered a religio licita legitimate religion. The JewishRoman wars resulted from political as well as religious conflicts the siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD led to the sacking of the temple and the dispersal of Jewish political power see Jewish diaspora. A 
3 rdcentury funerary stele is among the earliest Christian inscriptions written in both Greek and Latin. Christianity emerged in Roman Judaea as a Jewish religious sect in the 
1 st century and gradually spread out of Jerusalem throughout the Empire and beyond. Imperially authorized persecutions were limited and sporadic with martyrdoms occurring most often under the authority of local officials.492 Tacitus reports that after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64 the emperor attempted to deflect blame from himself onto the Christians.493 A major persecution occurred under the emperor Domitian494 and a persecution in 177 took place at Lugdunum the GalloRoman religious capital. A letter from Pliny the Younger governor of Bithynia describes his persecution and executions of Christians.495 The Decian persecution of 246251 seriously threatened the Christian Church but ultimately strengthened Christian defiance.496 Diocletian undertook the most severe persecution of Christians from 303 to 311.citation needed From the 
2 nd century onward the Church Fathers condemned the diverse religions practiced throughout the Empire as pagan.497 In the early 
4 th century Constantine I became the first emperor to convert to Christianity. He supported the Church financially and made laws that favored it but the new religion was already successful having moved from less than 50000 to over a million adherents between 150 and 2
50.4 98 Constantine and his successors banned public sacrifice while tolerating other traditional practices. Constantine never engaged in a purge499 there were no pagan martyrs during his reign500 and people who had not converted to Christianity remained in important positions at court.499302 Julian attempted to revive traditional public sacrifice and Hellenistic religion but met Christian resistance and lack of popular support.501 The Pantheon in Rome a Roman temple originally built under Augustus later converted into a Catholic church in the 
7 th century502 Christians of the 
4 th century believed the conversion of Constantine showed that Christianity had triumphed over paganism in Heaven and little further action besides such rhetoric was necessary.503 Thus their focus was heresy.504505 According to Peter Brown In most areas polytheists were not molested and apart from a few ugly incidents of local violence Jewish communities also enjoyed a century of stable even privileged existence.505641643506 There were antipagan laws but they were not generally enforced through the 
6 th century centers of paganism existed in Athens Gaza Alexandria and elsewhere.507 According to recent Jewish scholarship toleration of the Jews was maintained under Christian emperors.508 This did not extend to heretics508 Theodosius I made multiple laws and acted against alternate forms of Christianity509 and heretics were persecuted and killed by both the government and the church throughout Late Antiquity. NonChristians were not persecuted until the 
6 th century. Romes original religious hierarchy and ritual influenced Christian forms510511 and many preChristian practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions. Legacy Main article Legacy of the Roman Empire The Virginia State Capitol left built in the late 17
00 s was modelled after the Maison Carre right in Nmes France a GalloRoman temple built around 16 BC under Augustus. Several states claimed to be the Roman Empires successor. The Holy Roman Empire was established in 800 when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as Roman emperor. The Russian Tsardom as inheritor of the Byzantine Empires Orthodox Christian tradition counted itself the Third Rome Constantinople having been the second in accordance with the concept of translatio imperii.512 The last Eastern Roman titular Andreas Palaiologos sold the title of Emperor of Constantinople to Charles VIII of France upon Charles death Palaiologos reclaimed the title and on his death granted it to Ferdinand and Isabella and their successors who never used it. When the Ottomans who based their state on the Byzantine model took Constantinople in 1453 Mehmed II established his capital there and claimed to sit on the throne of the Roman Empire.513 He even launched an invasion of Otranto with the purpose of reuniting the Empire which was aborted by his death. In the medieval West Roman came to mean the church and the Catholic Pope. The Greek form Romaioi remained attached to the Greekspeaking Christian population of the Byzantine Empire and is still used by Greeks.514 The Roman Empires control of the Italian peninsula influenced Italian nationalism and the unification of Italy Risorgimento in 18

Res publica means Roman commonwealth and can refer to both the Republican and the Imperial eras. Imperium Romanum or Romanorum refers to the territorial extent of Roman authority. Populus Romanus the Roman people wasis often used to indicate the Roman state in matters involving other nations. The term Romania initially a colloquial term for the empires territory as well as a collective name for its inhabitants appears in Greek and Latin sources from the 
4 th century onward and was eventually carried over to the Eastern Roman Empire18  Fig. 1. Regions east of the Euphrates river were held only in the years 116117.  In 286 Emperor Diocletian divided the Roman Empire into two administrative unitsEast and Westan arrangement that periodically returned until the two halves were permanently divided in 3
95.3  Although the halves were independent in practice the Romans continued to consider the Roman Empire to be a single undivided state with two coequal emperors until the fall of the western half in 4764
80.3  Although emperors at times governed from other cities notably Mediolanum and Ravenna in the West and Nicomedia in the East Rome remained the de jure capital of the entire Roman Empire. In 330 Emperor Constantine I made Constantinople a second and new capital of the empire Second Rome or New Rome.456789 For a time mostly over the course of the later decades of the fourth century Rome continued to hold greater symbolic status on account of its greater antiquity as imperial capital.10 From at least 361 onwards senators belonging to the new senate in Constantinople enjoyed the same status and privileges as senators of the Roman Senate to which the new senate was largely identical.11 By 450 Constantinople was much grander in size and adornment than Rome and unquestionably senior in status.12  In 1204 the crusaders of the Fourth Crusade captured Constantinople and established the Latin Empire. The city remained under foreign rule until 1261 when it was captured by the Empire of Nicaea a ByzantineRoman successor state. Nicaea is usually considered the legitimate continuation of the Roman Empire during the interregnum 12041261 over its rivals in Trebizond and Thessalonica since it managed to retake Constantinople.13 Whether there was an interregnum at all is debatable given that the crusaders envisioned the Latin Empire to be the same empire as its predecessor and not a new state.14  Abbreviated HS.
