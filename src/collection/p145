WikiProject Ancient Egypt todo list edit history watch purge Needed articles. We should have an article on every pyramid and every nome in Ancient Egypt. Im sure the rest of us can think of other articles we should have. Cleanup. To start with most of the general history articles badly need attention. And Im told that at least some of the dynasty articles need work. Any other candidates Standardize the Chronology. A boring task but the benefit of doing it is that you can set the dates e.g. why say Khufu lived 25892566 As long as you keep the length of his reign correct or cite a respected source you can date it 25902567 or 25852563 Stub sorting Anyone I consider this probably the most unimportant of tasks on Wikipedia but if you believe it needs to be done . . . Data sorting. This is a project Id like to take on some day  could be applied to more of Wikipedia than just Ancient Egypt. Take one of the standard authorities of history or culture  Herotodus the Elder Pliny the writings of Breasted or Kenneth Kitchen  see if you cant smoothly merge quotations or information into relevant articles. Probably a good exercise for someone who owns one of those impressive texts yet cant get access to a research library.

Pepiedit How accurate are the years and lengths listed for the reigns and lives of these pharoahs How can we be sure Pepi II lived 100 years and reigned for 94 I find it doubtful that in the ancient world someone could live to 100 years old not sayin impossible just saying doubtful. It seems likely that there could have been some exaggeration on the part of the people who created these lists if indeed it was one group of people. How many sources show him to have lived and reigned this long and do those sources each stem from an original source that can confirm without question his reign If Im taking this information wrongly then forgive me. I dont whether this information is all presumptive and therefore flexible or whether it is intended to be accurate. Could someone straighten the issue out or at least source it maybe Although it does seem odd that someone could live for 100 years in the ancient world the three longest reigning kings in recorded history all ruled in the third millenium BC and that added to some other textual references to extremely old age means that somthing is likely up. However you are partially right there is another thesis saying he lived for only 64 years or so. However many if not most egyptologists consistantly give him 94 years of reign and as long as we have the citations for it it can stand in wikipedia. Thanatosimii 2256 6 January 2007 UTCreply We could say that he is said to have lived for 100 years.TutthothAnkhre talk 1956 9 May 2008 UTCreply Spellingsedit Im not sure where the spellings for the names in this list came from ancient Egyptian names are transliterated into Engish according to several methods. I compiled a list of the names of Pharaohs  some of the major variants at WikipediaWikiProject Ancient EgyptTemp. Any interest or objections to importing them into this list My methodology is detailed at the Talk page to that article.  llywrch 0343 31 Oct 2004 UTC I just took the names that were historically in Pharaoh. Please feel free to amend. I intended to compare and copy across alternative names from WikipediaWikiProject Ancient EgyptTemp anyway particularly Greek  Egyptian alternatives. There are also the chronology articles and the individual pharaoh and dynasty pages to crosscheck. But if you want to get on with it be my guest   ALoan Talk  I know its going to be a lot of work  Ill probably attack it dynasty by dynasty but I wanted to give everyone who cares a headsup that I was going to start on this  see what objections this might bring first. If no one else speaks up within a week Ill start on this.  llywrch 2110 1 Nov 2004 UTC Tentative nature of reconstructed namesedit Similar to the approximate dates and incompleteness of the list a paragraph should be added to warn the audience that the older the names the more likely their modern readings diverge from their presumed original pronunciation to the point that conventional readings might be completely different from what the names originally sounded like at least for the first dynasties. compare how in chinese the character  has values niao and diao  wu has reconstructed value kan etc Protodynastic Dynasty 
0 edit A few questions  Are there gaps in the separate kinglists of protodynastic Upper and Lower Egypt or do we have complete lists  The Conventional Egyptian chronology page lists more protodynastic kings than this page. Are there disagreements as to whether or not certain names represent the same king  Are Narmer and HorAha the same person It has been said that Narmer is Menes a name he took when he created the Pharaoh in Year 350. The Scorpion king may easily be Ptah as the planet Mars is Damuzi and turns back into the Scorpion on the day Venus is reborn. This poem is from Gilgamesh who talked to Noah before Noah died and before the Pharoah was created. Gilgamesh is not Nimrod as some say because Gilgamesh fears death from old age like Peleg does and Nimrod does not fear it Moslems say Nimrod ruledlived 500. Yet the TauPtahDamuziTamuz which is the planet Mars has been equated with Nimrod and so the poem by Gilgamesh is wrongly claimed to equate Nimrod and Gilgamesh both as The Scorpion King. Acknowledging the scorpion coming from Gilgameshs poem as being MarsDamuziTamuz then allows Narmer to exist and become Menes but another Scorpion Mars at venus rebirth does not occur until king Amizaduga long after the death of NarmerMenes. Not surprisingly then Amizaduga has also been claimed to be Nimrod. Narmer died in Abydos Egypt the abyss creating the legend of the devil ruling the abyss of the dead so it is not difficult to see that the Narmer Palette of Abydos is potentially the burial of Nimrod traditionally at age 500 in the names of Narmer and Menes. Christian 52 years for Nimrod comes from Mars units of 52 years of 360 days. Ussher retaining 20
09 bc for Marduk as Nimrod which reduces Septuagint postFlood time doesnt allow a 5
00 year Nimrod from 250920
09 bc so that the Moslem tradition of his 500 years is rejected by the Catholic world and he is claimed as king for only 52 years. But 500 years allows Narmer to move from Babel to Nineveh to Egypt. Do not delete this obviously anyone who doesnt beleive in great longevity has not done the tests of DNA molecules with carbon14 atoms in it causing cellular deterioration when they turn back into nitrogen.

1.1 74 talk 0534 5 March 2012 UTCreply  The Uj tomb of King Scorpion I from sometime between 3400 and 3200 BC this king is not mentioned on this list the King Scorpion of this list from ca. 3100 BC is Scorpion II correct.Rob117 0246 6 September 2005 UTCreply  1. Yes there are gaps there may have been multiple states which changed hands frequently. 2. Yes there are disagreements some may have been usurpers or rivals. 3. No they are most definately separate individuals with tombs near each other. HorAha is almost certainly Narmers immediate successor son. 4. Scorpian II may be Narmer Narmers neighboring king or a rival to Narmers throne. Clues are sketchy but Scorpian II seems to have ruled over Nekhen while or before Narmer was king of Abydos. At any rate Narmer would rule Nekhen as well.Countakeshi 1248 3 December 2005 UTCreply No that not the complete king list in dynasty 0.

91.6.2 8 talk 1224 9 October 2016 UTCreply I think that in upper Egypt the pharaohs were A then finger snail then fish who I suppose is represented by a tilapia so I call him JentJen then Penabu then Ba stork and finally Ka bull. Then theres dynatsy 0 which goes Scorpion I then Double falcon maybe then shendjw then Iry hor then Sekhen and finally Scorpion II. In lower egypt its Hedju then ny then ninieth then hat hor then pu then seka then khayu then tiu then tesh then neheb then wazner then mekh then a not the same a as the one of upper Egypt then Double flacon and finally Washi. The pharaohs you gave for upper Egypt while some I recognize not so much for Oryx shell Ka II bull II and others. Emmanuelbruh talk 0246 8 January 2024 UTCreply Thirteenth Dynastyedit The order of the kings is in the moment not based on any evidence. For example Sobekhotep I as first king is a guess. Senbuef is simply not an Egyptian name. Sebekemsaf I belongs to the 
17 th Dynasty. King Wahibre Ibau Turin King List colume VII 2 is missing and and and.... The order attested in the Turin King List Alan H. Gardner The Royal Canon of Turin Oxford 1987 pl. III would provide at least one guideline. Otherwise we know simply very little about this Dynasty.  Udimu 
22 nd and 
25 th dynasties Shaw datesedit These are generally accurate but not specific enough. The dates I put in for these two dynasties were not original research I was citing them from other Wikipedia articles that used used astronomical events to anchor an absolute chronology. These articles cited their sources. Additionally Shaw has Shoshenq III reigning after Takelot II but the contemoraneity of these two kings is pretty certain see Takelot II. Likewise the articles on Piye Shabaka and Shebitku have more specific reignal years. Shaws dates for Shabakas death and Shebitkus accession appear to be about five years off. Is it all right if I reenter these dates Rob117 1633 24 September 2005 UTCreply Hey Rob  I wonder if its really vain to try to keep up with the most recent twists and turns of ancient chronological studies. It seems to me that the wisest course for a general list like this one is to base ourselves on the most recent authoritative general source and then discuss alternative views in the articles on the pharaohs themselves. Otherwise things start to get really complicated. john k 0108 2 November 2005 UTCreply Okay.Rob117 0544 26 January 2006 UTCreply Good idea Crazy 29 1537 15 July 2006 UTCreply Oxford datesedit I would suggest that we should not simply leave these as they are. They provide good approximate guidelines from which to start but they are not exact dates. There are more specific chronologies that can be implemented for certain dynasties Dynasties 11 12 18 and 2225 especially.Rob117 0228 30 September 2005 UTCreply Oxford dates 
2 edit In the moment the dates of the 
13 th Dynasty do not fit with the dates of the 
12 th Dynasty. There is in the moment a gap of 4 years between the last ruler of the 
12 th and the first ruler of the 
13 th Dynasty. I do not have the Oxford dates and I do not have any strong opions regarding certain dates because we do not know them for sure. However somebody might solve this problem. Udimu 2327 11 October 2005 UTCreply Well in Dynasty 12 we have an absolute anchor at year 7 of Senusret III due to a heliacal rising of Sirius. Its possible that there are coregencies we are unaware of somewhere in either the 
12 th or 
13 th dynasty. For now the best thing would probably be to just leave the 
4 year overlap between Dynasties 12 and 13 alone until we get more info.Rob117 0105 13 October 2005 UTCreply Sixteenth and Seventeenth Dynastiesedit For some reason we have several kings Djehuti Mentuhotep VI Nebiryerawet Nebiriau I  II and Seuserenre Bebiankh belonging to both dynasties with different dates implied. Also there needs to be some uniformity as to whether Intef or Antef is the correct spelling of the names of the kings of the Seventeenth. Theelf29 1003 24 September 2007 UTCreply Ninth Dynastyedit Can anyone provide a source for this line of rulers There appear to be numerous duplications and the Ninth Dynastys Menethoupe I is I fancy Metuhotep I Tepya normally placed at the beginning of the Eleventh Dynasty. Theelf29 1019 24 September 2007 UTCreply The

01.1 58 talk 2138 2 August 2014 UTCreply Tuthmosis III and Hatshepsutedit The claim that Israel is mentioned on the walls in Karnak is incorrect. The problem with the reference is that its a PBS documentary which is not a good academic source. In the literature there is mention of an inscription of some people who may correspond to the ones mentioned in the Merneptah Stela but the name Israel is not used. See for instance 1 a page from Biblical peoples and ethnicity an archaeological study of Egyptians Canaanites Philistines and early Israel 13001100 B.C.E. by Ann E. Killebrew. The quote that Hatshepsut started a great many building projects is a bit of a misstatement as well. She is of course known for the temple at Deir elBahari but other than that she is not a really prolific builder like for instance Ramesses II. Im not sure why we would need to include some of these things in the list of Pharaohs Seems a bit too much detail AnnekeBart talk 1853 14 March 2011 UTCreply Ramessesedit Werent there over 20 Pharaohs named Rameses Also what does the name mean Tophthemetalbender talk 1615 8 May 2011 UTCreply Actually there were only 3 pharaohs named Ramesses. What does the name mean Tophthemetalbender talk 1621 8 May 2011 UTCreply There were eleven pharaohs named Ramesses. They were appropriately named Ramesses I Ramesses II ... Ramesses XI. See the

21.2 
21.7 
5.1 87 . The edits are all highly religious in nature and refer to unreferenced and highly suspect theories such as the fact that Joseph aged 130 interpreted the dreams of Senusret III. I know the bible and I believe discussions of the connections between the bible and pharaohs are interesting but should not take place on this page plus it is not even a discussion in this case. IryHor talk 1354 17 May 2012 UTCreply Sorry I thought Id reverted them. Maybe having 150 tabs open in Firefox is a bad idea. Id opened the history to compare the IPs edits with the earlier version but had left that as something to do later but later was just now rather than several hours ago when I saw them. Dougweller talk 1732 17 May 2012 UTCreply Lol 150 tabs  I did not even know it was both humanely and computerly possible. IryHor talk 1745 17 May 2012 UTCreply Firefox and 
8 gb of ram. Dougweller talk 1920 19 May 2012 UTCreply Djedefreedit The comment on Djedefre is  Before being demolished by the Romans according to a documentary aired by the History Channel the pyramid may actually have been the highest ever built about 20 meters taller than the Great Pyramid of Giza although this is due to its elevated location rather than the size from base to tip. This is evidently complete BS and should consequently be removed or at least moved to the article on Djedefre. In any case  1 this is in blatent contradiction to Djedefre short reign 2 The amount of work required to destroy a pyramid is as fantastic as that to build it see the 
13 th century attempt on the pyramid of Khufu and we have no trace the romans destroyed a pyramid 3 History channel is way down in quality now... At the opposite I can believe that Djedefre started work on his pyramid and that it may have been initially planned as something larger than his fathers but it is known that his pyramid never went past the very early stages of work owing to Djedefre short reign. IryHor talk 1635 20 May 2012 UTCreply Thampthis and Nitocrisedit Slightly confused as when I click on the link for Pharoah Djedefptah it comes up with a page for Thampthis who is listed as the next pharoah. Also there is a page on Wiki for a Pharoah Nitocris End of 
6 th Dynasty who doesnt appear on this list. I might be wrong but thanks anyway Thenextpm talk 2037 21 June 2012 UTCreply Bithiahedit Does Bithiah have a place in this article If not where is the best place for her Egyptian Princesses Twillisjr talk 1444 19 June 2013 UTCreply Since she was not a pharaoh she doesnt belong in this article. What do you mean with best place for her She is already quite well linked too within Wikipedia. See 2 Garion96 talk 1607 19 June 2013 UTCreply Agreed she is well linked. However there is no place for her and other Egyptian Princesses in a list. I am trying to determine where that monarchyrelated distinction will sit once and for all regarding Egypt. Twillisjr talk 1027 20 June 2013 UTCreply there is no list for Ancient Egyptian princesses and I wonder whether such list would make any sense. There is hardly such list in research literature. I think the article at the moment is fine.  Udimu talk 1102 20 June 2013 UTCreply Addition of cartouches to Pharao namesedit I propose the addition of cartouches of each Pharao. RScheiber talk 0931 23 August 2013 UTCreply Beginning of the reign of Nyuserre Iniedit Beginning of the reign of Nyuserre Ini should probably be at 2448 BC. This date needs to be changed both in his article and in the list. Ybarton talk 2238 27 May 2014 UTCreply Actually I meant 2458 BC the end of the rule of Neferefre who precedes him.  Ybarton talk 0500 4 June 2014 UTCreply Last Monarchedit Last Monarch is a problem and the term native also. The last native king was Ramesses XI. All the following kings were either Libyans Nubians Libyans again Persians Libyans again Persians again Macedonians Romans Persians again etc. The last actual king was dethroned by Nasser.

65.6 0 Wikipedia only sort of has a date formatting standard. The relevant part of the style guide is WPERA. To sum it up an article can use either BCAD or BCECE as long as it consistently sticks to one style. Changing the style requires a discussion of the reasons why. In some topic areas there may be a loose consensus to use only one style or the other for example I think WikiProject Judaism prefers BCECE to avoid the impression of Christian bias. WikiProject Ancient Egypt has never chosen one style or the other. The main ancient Egypt article uses BCAD and so do many or most of our other articles including this one but some were created with BCECE and have stayed that way. A. Parrot talk 0127 18 December 2015 UTCreply Reason for Dynasty 0 and Dynasty 00 splitedit Why are the predynastic rulers of Dynasty 0 under the Early Dynastic Period Thats a contradiction in terms and also the Early Dynastic Period page explicitly states that it begins with the First Dynasty. Furthermore why distinguish between Dynasty 0 and Dynasty 00 Dynasty 00 contains Upper Egypt rulers in Naqada III and another name for Naqada III is Dynasty 0 see link and all the Dynasty 0 rulers except Crocodile were Upper Egypt rulers and Crocodile may have reigned from Tarkhan of Lower Egypt but this is not certain. So wouldnt a more appropriate distinction be made between Lower Egypt rulers Upper Egypt rulers and Crocodile in his own category or under Lower Egypt but with a caviat all under the Predynastic period Retardednamingpolicy talk 2242 18 November 2016 UTCreply External links modifiededit Hello fellow Wikipedians I have just modified one external link on List of pharaohs.

Cheers.InternetArchiveBot Report bug 1019 1 January 2018 UTCreply What does the phrase only attested in Lower Nubia mean How are pharaohs attestededit you see the phrase in ListofpharaohsEnigmatickingsonlyattestedinLowerNubia How is a possible Pharaoh attested Greg Dahlen talk 1232 31 July 2018 UTCreply Attested usually means archaeologically attested meaning that king is most likely confirmed as really existing or reigning there by an archaeological find from the time mentioning his name. When we have much later king lists that mention a king whose name was never confirmed in archaeology in some cases because the later lists were probably tampered with or unreliable we call that king unattested. Only attested in Lower Nubia means there is archaeological evidence of a real past king but only found in Lower Nubia.

49.2 52 talk 1245 31 July 2018 UTCreply Attested used in this sense is a bit of archaeological jargon that Id like to remove from Wikipedia articles because this isnt the first time Ive seen a layperson react to it with bafflement. The reason it sticks around though is that its shorter than the phrases that convey the same meaning. A. Parrot talk 0323 1 August 2018 UTCreply Can you give a couple of examples of those phrases And how is attested different in archaeology The para above seems a normal use to me.. Is confirmed good enough for the article MBG02 talk 1414 15 August 2018 UTCreply I dont know Im just more familiar with seeing attest in contexts like as I can attest from personal experience or The iridium layer attests that a meteor struck Earth. For something to be attested as in Narmer is attested throughout the Nile Delta or Osiris is first attested in the middle of the Fifth Dynasty feels a little more opaque and technical. But those sentences are shorter than Artifacts bearing Narmers name are found throughout the Nile Delta or similar. In this specific case Enigmatic kings whose name is only found in Lower Nubia would be the clearest way of wording the section heading but would be cumbersomely long for a heading. A. Parrot talk 0507 16 August 2018 UTCreply I oppose removal of the word attested usage of which is standard in archaeology history and related fields. Confirmed meaning there is evidence rising to the level of proof is stronger than and does not mean the same thing as attested meaning there is evidence. Lowellian reply 1911 1 November 2019 UTCreply Erroredit The dates between 
10 th dinasty and 
11 th there is somthing wrong with it how the 
10 th dinasty start at 2130 bc and end at 2040 bc and the 
11 th start at 2134 and end at 1991 i think the eleventh should logicly start at the end of the 
10 th so at 2040 Myresearchmm talk 1839 6 April 2021 UTCreply During the intermediate periods there were often rival dynasties controlling different parts of Egypt. The Tenth and Eleventh Dynasties overlap because the Eleventh Dynasty established itself in Thebes while the Tenth Dynasty still dominated the north before the Eleventh Dynasty gained control of the entire country and event that marks the beginning of the Middle Kingdom. A. Parrot talk 1857 6 April 2021 UTCreply 5 pharaohs left of Mekh on the Palermo Stoneedit I was comparing 2 images of the Palermo Stone and it appears there are five destroyed pharoah names left of Mekh number 8 although this list currently only mentions a singular partially destroyed ...a left of Mekh number 9 on the image. Should we mention these other pharaohs too Zoom in on the top row with the pharaohs. 5 extra pharaoh columns to the left of Mekh. Koopinator talk 0949 14 April 2022 UTCreply Pages about Predynastic Kingsedit The articles for many of the Predynastic rulers contain very little information and rely on the same sources. Might it be worthwhile to merge these into a general article about Predynastic rulers This may not be the place to bring up such a proposition but this may be something worth discussing. R23

3 R talk 0044 13 August 2022 UTCreply Pharaoh Baedit httpsen.m.wikipedia.orgwikiBapharaoh I feel like this Pharaoh should be added however due to his unknown exact Dynasty grouping Im unsure on how to go about this. Spooky Polyhedron talk 0644 22 September 2022 UTCreply Many missing names needs workedit httpsen.m.wikipedia.orgwikiSixteenthDynastyofEgypt After analyzing this its come to my attention that their are many missing names on this list attributed to the second intermediate period. Pharaohs like Pepi III and many others are not present on this list. Please not some names are already on the list. Spooky Polyhedron talk 0656 9 October 2022 UTCreply Question on Throne Namesedit Hi Id like to see if there was a source on the throne names of Cleopatra VII etc. as I did a quick google search and I couldnt find any results for Weretnebetneferu Akhetzeh beyond this wiki page and the websites that skim from it. It along with a number of other names seem to be added by user Zhomron and Im just wondering what his source is for these names so they could be verified by users of this cite. Many thanks NebuchadnezzarHammurabi talk 0756 6 November 2022 UTCreply I just noticed the same thing. Its not even clear to me what a throne name is supposed to be as distinct from the ruling name like Cleopatra VII Worth noting that the user Zhomron is banned on Wikipedia so theres a very good chance this was vandalism. They made a lot of edits to this page so someone with more knowledgeable and care than me might want to go through his edits looking for vandalism.

46 DBCAB talk 2158 2 February 2023 UTCreply For posterity I do believe they are instead of throne name and personal name the Horus name and Prenomen. This is attested to on this UCL site see this example for Cleopatra VII httpswww.ucl.ac.ukmuseumsstaticdigitalegyptchronologycleopatravii.html which appears to have been created at least in part by Egyptologist Wolfram Grajetzki. Therefore the mystery appears to be solved. Ill look into it further and attempt to make this clearer in the article in the coming days. NebuchadnezzarHammurabi talk 1315 14 February 2023 UTCreply The Horus Name PrenomenThrone Name and NomenPersonal Name were three separate forms of the kings fivefold royal titulary with the Horus name being an earlier form written inside of a serekh rather than a cartouche which is what the Prenomen and Nomen were written in. Use and importance of the Horus name and Prenomen varied depending on the period as many earlier kings didnt have Prenomens but did have Horus Names and some kings especially during the Intermediate Periods had documented Prenomens but no documented Horus Name. Star11308 talk 1245 16 February 2023 UTCreply Pharaohs Brainsedit I believe the reason the Pharaohs brains were removed is that they were people of great sorrow or led ugly lives that they or others did not want repeated. So they pulled their consciousness out of their bodies . 260

Community Tech bot talk 1353 20 May 2023 UTCreply Transliterationsedit The transliteration system used here seems to be fairly inconsistent but this is Egyptology so Im not surprised  cf. Ra vs. Re User vs. Weser etc. Perhaps we should add the transliterations of the original Egyptian names to make it more clear what the originals would have been except maybe the Ptolemies and the Persians who have names that arent in Egyptian at all  but this could get inconsistent in the Late Period fast. If anyone has a reputable source reconstructing names Im happpy to do the slogging myself.ZenzicEvristos talk 2228 16 August 2023 UTCreply Abaedit Two websites dictionary.sensagent.com and creationwiki.org list a king Aba that reigned for 4 years and 2 m
