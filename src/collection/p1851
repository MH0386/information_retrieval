The most famous member of this dynasty was Cleopatra VII in modern times known simply as Cleopatra who was successively the consort of Julius Caesar and after Caesars death of Mark Antony having children with both of them.Cleopatra strove to create a dynastic and political union between Egypt and Rome but the assassination of Caesar and the defeat of Mark Antony doomed her plans.citation neededdateMarch 20
18 Caesarion Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar was the last king of the Ptolemaic Dynasty of Egypt and he reigned jointly with his mother Cleopatra VII of Egypt from September 2 47 BC. He was the eldest son of Cleopatra VII and possibly the only son of Julius Caesar after whom he was named. Between the alleged death of Cleopatra on August 12 30 BC up to his own alleged death on August 23 30 BC he was nominally the sole pharaoh. It is tradition that he was hunted down and killed on the orders of Octavian who would become the Roman emperor Augustus but the historical evidence does not exist.citation neededdateMarch 2018 classwikitable width100 width15  ImageThrone name width15  Personal name width50  Comments width20  Dates FilePtolemy I Soter Louvre Ma849.jpg1
