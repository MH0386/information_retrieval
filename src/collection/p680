22 nd century BC but its actual existence is debated. The only historical account on the Seventh Dynasty was in Manethos Aegyptiaca a history of Egypt written in the 
3 rd century BC where the Seventh Dynasty appears essentially as a metaphor for chaos. Since next to nothing is known of this dynasty beyond Manethos account Egyptologists such as Jrgen von Beckerath and Toby Wilkinson have usually considered it to be fictitious.12 In a 2015 reappraisal of the fall of the Old Kingdom the Egyptologist Hracht Papazian has proposed that the Seventh Dynasty was real and that it consisted of kings usually attributed to the Eighth Dynasty. Historical sourcesedit Based on the now lost writings of Africanus c. 160240 and Eusebius c. 260340 themselves based on the now lost work of the Egyptian priest Manetho 
3 rd century BC the Byzantine scholar George Syncellus died after 810 variously assigns to the period after the Sixth dynasty  the Seventh Dynasty  70 kings in 70 days Africanus or 5 kings in 75 days Eusebius.3395 According to Manetho these kings would have ruled in Memphis.3396 Rather than a historical reality this rapid succession of kings has long been interpreted as a metaphor for chaos.3395 Some Egyptologists such as Papazian 20153395 believe that this interpretation may give undue weight to Manethos writings and that it distorts the general scholarly understanding of the end of the Old Kingdom. According to Papazian 20153395 a reexamination ... of the Seventh Dynastys existence remains fully justified and some of the kings usually attributed to the midEighth Dynasty should instead be understood to belong to the Seventh Dynasty. Being attested by two additional ancient historical sources as well as archeological evidence the Eighth Dynasty is not quite as obscure as the Seventh. As a consequence some Egyptologists combine the Seventh and Eighth Dynasty into a single line of kings reigning immediately after the Sixth Dynasty. List of rulersedit The Seventh Dynasty is usually considered fictitious and is thus either ignored altogether by modern scholars or it is combined with the Eighth Dynasty. The Egyptologist Hracht Papazian has proposed in 2015 that a number of rulers usually seen as belonging to the midEighth Dynasty identified by the Abydos King List should be attributed to a Seventh Dynasty3416 Dynasty VII as per Papazian3416 Name Evidence beyond the Abydos king list Djedkare Shemai  Neferkare Khendu  Merenhor  Neferkamin  Nikare Possibly attested by a cylinder seal.4 Neferkare Tereru  Neferkahor Attested by a cylinder seal.

ISBN 9781408810026. The system of dynasties devised in the third century B.C. by Manetho is not without its problemsfor example the Seventh Dynasty is now recognized as being wholly spurious while several dynasties are known to have ruled concurrently in different parts of Egypt...
