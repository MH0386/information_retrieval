The region of Nubia was an early cradle of civilization producing several complex societies that engaged in trade and industry.8 The citystate of Kerma emerged as the dominant political force between 2450 and 1450 BC controlling the Nile Valley between the first and fourth cataracts an area as large as Egypt. The Egyptians were the first to identify Kerma as Kush probably from the indigenous ethnonym Kasu over the next several centuries the two civilizations engaged in intermittent warfare trade and cultural exchange.9 Much of Nubia came under Egyptian rule during the New Kingdom period 15501070 BC. Following Egypts disintegration amid the Late Bronze Age collapse the Kushites reestablished a kingdom in Napata now modern Karima Sudan. Though Kush had developed many cultural affinities with Egypt such as the veneration of Amun and the royal families of both kingdoms occasionally intermarried Kushite culture language and ethnicity was distinct Egyptian art distinguished the people of Kush by their dress appearance and even method of transportation.8 In the 
8 th century BC King Kashta the Kushite peacefully became King of Upper Egypt while his daughter Amenirdis was appointed as Divine Adoratrice of Amun in Thebes.10 His successor Piye invaded Lower Egypt establishing the Kushiteruled Twentyfifth Dynasty. Piyes daughter Shepenupet II was also appointed Divine Adoratrice of Amun. The monarchs of Kush ruled Egypt for over a century until the Assyrian conquest finally being expelled by the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal in the midseventh century BC. Following the severing of ties with Egypt the Kushite imperial capital was located at Mero during which time it was known by the Greeks as Aethiopia. From the third century BC to the third century AD northern Nubia would be invaded and annexed by Egypt. Ruled by the Macedonians and Romans for the next 600 years this territory would be known in the GrecoRoman world as Dodekaschoinos. It was later taken back under control by the fourth Kushite king Yesebokheamani. The Kingdom of Kush persisted as a major regional power until the fourth century AD when it weakened and disintegrated from internal rebellion amid worsening climatic conditions and invasions and conquest of the kingdom of Kush by the Noba people who introduced the Nubian languages and gave their name to Nubia itself. Because the Noba and the Blemmyes were at war with the Kushites the Aksumites took advantage of this capturing Mero and looting its gold marking the end of the kingdom and its dissolution into the three polities of Nobatia Makuria and Alodia though the Aksumite presence in Meroe was likely short lived. Sometime after this event the Kingdom of Alodia would gain control of the southern territory of the former Meroitic empire including parts of Eritrea.11 Long overshadowed by its more prominent Egyptian neighbor archaeological discoveries since the late 
20 th century have revealed Kush to be an advanced civilization in its own right. The Kushites had their own unique language and script maintained a complex economy based on trade and industry mastered archery and developed a complex urban society with uniquely high levels of female participation.12 Nameedit Kush in hieroglyphs k3 Kush The native name of the Kingdom was recorded in Egyptian as k likely pronounced IPA kuu or IPA kuu in Middle Egyptian when the term was first used for Nubia based on the New Kingdomera Akkadian transliteration of the genitive ksi.131415 It is also an ethnic term for the native population who initiated the kingdom of Kush. The term is also displayed in the names of Kushite persons16 such as King Kashta a transcription of kt one from the land of Kush. Geographically Kush referred to the region south of the first cataract in general. Kush also was the home of the rulers of the 
25 th Dynasty.17 The name Kush since at least the time of Josephus has been connected with the biblical character Cush in the Hebrew Bible Hebrew  son of Ham Genesis 106. Ham had four sons named Cush Put Canaan and Mizraim Hebrew name for Egypt. According to the Bible Nimrod a son of Cush was the founder and king of Babylon Erech Akkad and Calneh in Shinar Gen 10
10.1 8 The Bible also makes reference to someone named Cush who is a Benjamite Psalms 71 KJV.19 In Greek sources Kush was known as Kous  or Aethiopia .20 Historyedit Preludeedit Kerma culture c.2500 BCc.1550 BC Kerma bowl 17001550 BC. Museum of Fine Arts Boston Mirror. End of Kerma Period 17001550 BC. Museum of Fine Arts Boston Kerma culture 25001500 BCedit Main article Kerma culture The Kerma culture was an early civilization centered in Kerma Sudan. It flourished from around 2500 BC to 1500 BC in ancient Nubia. The Kerma culture was based in the southern part of Nubia or Upper Nubia in parts of presentday northern and central Sudan and later extended its reach northward into Lower Nubia and the border of Egypt.21 The polity seems to have been one of several Nile Valley states during the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. In the Kingdom of Kermas latest phase lasting from about 17001500 BC it absorbed the Sudanese kingdom of Sai and became a sizable populous empire rivaling Egypt.

18 th dynasty Tomb of Huy. c.1342  c.1325 BC Mentuhotep II the 
21 st century BC founder of the Middle Kingdom is recorded to have undertaken campaigns against Kush in the 
29 th and 
31 st years of his reign. This is the earliest Egyptian reference to Kush the Nubian region had gone by other names in the Old Kingdom.22 Under Thutmose I Egypt made several campaigns south. The Egyptians ruled Kush in the New kingdom beginning when the Egyptian King Thutmose I occupied Kush and destroyed its capital Kerma.23 This eventually resulted in their annexation of Nubia c.1504 BC. Around 1500 BC Nubia was absorbed into the New Kingdom of Egypt but rebellions continued for centuries. After the conquest Kerma culture was increasingly Egyptianized yet rebellions continued for 220 years until c.1300 BC. Nubia nevertheless became a key province of the New Kingdom economically politically and spiritually. Indeed major pharaonic ceremonies were held at Jebel Barkal near Napata.24 As an Egyptian colony from the 
16 th century BC Nubia Kush was governed by an Egyptian Viceroy of Kush. Resistance to the early eighteenth Dynasty Egyptian rule by neighboring Kush is evidenced in the writings of Ahmose son of Ebana an Egyptian warrior who served under Nebpehtrya Ahmose 15391514 BC Djeserkara Amenhotep I 15141493 BC and Aakheperkara Thutmose I 14931481 BC. At the end of the Second Intermediate Period midsixteenth century BC Egypt faced the twin existential threatsthe Hyksos in the North and the Kushites in the South. Taken from the autobiographical inscriptions on the walls of his tombchapel the Egyptians undertook campaigns to defeat Kush and conquer Nubia under the rule of Amenhotep I 15141493 BC. In Ahmoses writings the Kushites are described as archers Now after his Majesty had slain the Bedoin of Asia he sailed upstream to Upper Nubia to destroy the Nubian bowmen.25 The tomb writings contain two other references to the Nubian bowmen of Kush. By 1200 BC Egyptian involvement in the Dongola Reach was nonexistent. Egypts international prestige had declined considerably towards the end of the Third Intermediate Period. Its historical allies the inhabitants of Canaan had fallen to the Middle Assyrian Empire 13651020 BC and then the resurgent NeoAssyrian Empire 935605 BC. The Assyrians from the tenth century BC onwards had once more expanded from northern Mesopotamia and conquered a vast empire including the whole of the Near East and much of Anatolia the eastern Mediterranean the Caucasus and early Iron Age Iran. According to Josephus Flavius the biblical Moses led the Egyptian army in a siege of the Kushite city of Meroe. To end the siege Princess Tharbis was given to Moses as a diplomatic bride and thus the Egyptian army retreated back to Egypt.26 Formation c. 1070754 BCedit Relief from the temple of Semna depicting queenking Karimala approaching Isis

9 th century BC27 With the disintegration of the New Kingdom around 1070 BC Kush became an independent kingdom centered at Napata in modern northern Sudan.28 This moreEgyptianized Kingdom of Kush emerged possibly from Kerma and regained the regions independence from Egypt. The extent of culturalpolitical continuity between the Kerma culture and the chronologically succeeding Kingdom of Kush is difficult to determine. The latter polity began to emerge around 1000 BC 500 years after the end of the Kingdom of Kerma.citation needed Jebel Barkal was venerated as residence of Amun and became an essential symbol of Kushite kingship The pyramids of elKurru after Carl Richard Lepsius 1859 The first Kushite king known by name was Alara who ruled somewhere between 80029 and 760 BC.30 No contemporary inscriptions of him exist.29 He was first mentioned in the funerary stela of his daughter Tabiry the wife of king Piye. Later royal inscriptions remember Alara as the founder of the dynasty some calling him chieftain others king. A 
7 th century inscription claimed that his sister was the grandmother of king Taharqo.31 An inscription of the 
5 th century king Amanineteyerike remembered Alaras reign as long and successful.32 Alara was probably buried at elKurru although there exists no inscription to identify his tomb.29 It has been proposed that it was Alara who turned Kush from a chiefdom to an Egyptianized kingdom centered around the cult of Amun.33 Rule over Egypt 754 BC656 BCedit Main article Twentyfifth Dynasty of Egypt Alaras successor Kashta extended Kushite control north to Elephantine and Thebes in Upper Egypt. Kashtas successor Piye seized control of Lower Egypt around 727 BC.34 Piyes Victory Stela celebrating these campaigns between 728 and 716 BC was found in the Amun temple at Jebel Barkal. He invaded an Egypt fragmented into four kingdoms ruled by King Peftjauawybast King Nimlot King Iuput II and King Osorkon IV.35115120 Statues of various rulers of the late

Kerma Museum.36 Why the Kushites chose to enter Egypt at this crucial point of foreign domination is subject to debate. Archaeologist Timothy Kendall offers his own hypotheses connecting it to a claim of legitimacy associated with Jebel Barkal.37 Kendall cites the Victory Stele of Piye at Jebel Barkal which states that Amun of Napata granted me to be ruler of every foreign country and Amun in Thebes granted me to be ruler of the Black Land Kmt. According to Kendall foreign lands in this regard seems to include Lower Egypt while Kmt seems to refer to a united Upper Egypt and Nubia.37 Piyes successor Shabataka defeated the Saite kings of northern Egypt between 711 and 710 BC and installed himself as king in Memphis. He then established ties with Sargon II of the NeoAssyrian Empire.35120 After the reign of Shabaka Pharaoh Taharqas army undertook successful military campaigns as attested by the list of conquered Asiatic principalities from the Mut temple at Karnak and conquered peoples and countries Libyans Shasu nomads Phoenicians Khor in Palestine from Sanam temple inscriptions.38 However the regions in the southern Levant claimed by Shabataka were seen by Assyria as under their dominion and imperial ambitions of both the Mesopotamian based Assyrian Empire and Kushite Empire made war with the 
25 th dynasty inevitable. In 701 BC Taharqa and his army aided Judah and King Hezekiah in withstanding a siege by King Sennacherib of the Assyrians 2 Kings 199 Isaiah 3
79.3 9 There are various theories Taharqas army40 disease divine intervention Hezekiahs surrender or agreeing to pay tribute as to why the Assyrians failed to take the city.41 Historian Lszl Trk mentions that Egypts army was beaten at Eltekeh under Taharqas command but the battle could be interpreted as a victory for the double kingdom since Assyria did not take Jerusalem however the Egyptian and Kushite forces withdrew to Egypt and the Assyrian king Sennacherib appears to have occupied part of the Sinai.42 Pyramids of Nuri built between the reigns of Taharqa circa 670 BC and Nastasen circa 310 BC. The power of the 
25 th Dynasty reached a climax under Taharqa. The Nile valley empire was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom. New prosperity16 revived Egyptian culture.43 Religion the arts and architecture were restored to their glorious Old Middle and New Kingdom forms. The Kushite pharaohs built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley including Memphis Karnak Kawa and Jebel Barkal.4445 It was during the 
25 th dynasty that the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids many in modern Sudan since the Middle Kingdom.464748 The Kushites developed their own script the Meroitic alphabet which was influenced by Egyptian writing systems c.700600 BC although it appears to have been wholly confined to the royal court and major temples.49 Assyrian conquest of Egyptedit Main article Assyrian conquest of Egypt Wall panel depicting Assyrian soldiers storming a Kushite fortress in Egypt. Niniveh Iraq. Taharqa and his Judean allies initially defeated the Assyrians at Ashkelon when war broke out in 674 BC.citation needed The relatively small Assyrian force had first defeafed Canaanite and Arab tribes in the region and then immediately marched at great speed on Ashkelon leaving them exhausted.citation needed However in 671 BC the Assyrian King Esarhaddon started the Assyrian conquest of Egypt with a larger and better prepared force. The Assyrians advanced rapidly and decisively. Memphis was taken and Taharqa fled to Nubia while his heir and other family members were taken to the Assyrian capital Nineveh as prisoners. Esarhaddon boasted how he deported all Aethiopians from Egypt leaving not one to pay homage to me However the native Egyptian vassal rulers installed by Esarhaddon as puppets were unable to effectively retain full control of the entire country and Taharqa was able to regain control of Memphis. Esarhaddons 669 BC campaign to once more eject Taharqa was abandoned when Esarhaddon died in Harran on the way to Egypt leaving Esarhaddons successor Ashurbanipal the task. He defeated Taharqa driving his forces back into Nubia and Taharqa died in Napata soon after in 664 BC.35121 Wall painting of king Tantamani from his tomb in elKurru under whom Egypt was lost for good Taharqas successor Tantamani sailed north from Napata through Elephantine and to Thebes with a large army where he was ritually installed as the king of Egypt.50 From Thebes Tantamani began his attempt at reconquest50 and regained control of a part of southern Egypt as far as Memphis from the native Egyptian puppet rulers installed by the Assyrians.51 Tantamanis dream stele states that he restored order from the chaos where royal temples and cults were not being maintained.50 After defeating Sais and killing Assyrias vassal Necho I in Memphis some local dynasts formally surrendered while others withdrew to their fortresses.50185 Tantamani proceeded north of Memphis invading Lower Egypt and besieged cities in the Delta a number of which surrendered to him.citation needed The Assyrians who had maintained only a small military presence in the north then sent a large army southwards in 663 BC. Tantamani was decisively routed and the Assyrian army sacked Thebes to such an extent it never truly recovered. Tantamani was chased back to Nubia but he continued to try and assert control over Upper Egypt until c.656 BC. At this date a native Egyptian ruler Psamtik I son of Necho placed on the throne as a vassal of Ashurbanipal took control of Thebes.1652 The last links between Kush and Upper Egypt were severed after hostilities with the Saite kings in the 5
90 s BC.35121122 Napatan period 656 BCc. 270 BCedit Kushite civilization continued for several centuries. According to Welsby throughout the Saite Persian Ptolemaic and Roman periods the Kushite rulersthe descendants of the XXVth Dynasty pharaohs and the guardians of the Temple of Amun at Jebel Barkal
53 could have pressed their legitimate claim for control of Egypt and they thus posed a potential threat to the rulers of Egypt.516667 Kushite delegation on a Persian relief from the Apadana palace c.500 BC Herodotus mentioned an invasion of Kush by the Achaemenid ruler Cambyses c.530 BC. By some accounts Cambyses succeeded in occupying the area between the first and second Nile cataract54 however Herodotus mentions that his expedition failed miserably in the desert.516566 Achaemenid inscriptions from both Egypt and Iran include Kush as part of the Achaemenid empire.55 For example the DNa inscription of Darius I r.522486 BC on his tomb at Naqshe Rustam mentions Ky Old Persian cuneiform  pronounced Kshy among the territories being ruled over by the Achaemenid Empire.5655 Derek Welsby states scholars have doubted that this Persian expedition ever took place but... archaeological evidence suggests that the fortress of Dorginarti near the second cataract served as Persias southern boundary.516566 From around 425300 BC beginning under the rule of king Amannoteerike Kush saw a series of kings who revitalized older practices such as the erection of royal steles or royal statues. It was likely also in this period when several older pyramids among them that of Taharqo were enlarged. The stele of king Harsiotef who from around 400 BC ruled for at least 35 years reports how he fought a multitude of campaigns against enemies ranging from Meroe in the south to Lower Nubia in the north while also donating to temples throughout Kush. King Nastasen c. 325 waged several wars against nomad groups and again in Lower Nubia.57 Nastasen was the last king to be buried at Nuri.58 His successors built six pyramids at Jebel Barkal and two in the old necropolis of elKurru although the lack of inscriptions prevents identifying their occupants. It seems likely that this was a time of unrest and conflict within the royal elite.59 Meroitic period c. 270 BC
4 th century ADedit Main article Mero Aspelta moved the capital to Mero considerably farther south than Napata possibly c.591 BC60 just after the sack of Napata by Psamtik II. Martin Meredith states the Kushite rulers chose Mero between the Fifth and Sixth Cataracts because it was on the fringe of the summer rainfall belt and the area was rich in iron ore and hardwood for iron working. The location also afforded access to trade routes to the Red Sea. The Kush traded iron products with the Romans in addition to gold ivory and slaves. The Butana plain was stripped of its forests leaving behind slag piles.6162 Jewelry found on the Mummy of Nubian King Amaninatakilebte 538519 BC Nuri pyramid 10. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. Gold flower shaped diadem found in the Pyramid of King Talakhamani 435431 BC Nuri pyramid 16. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. In about 300 BC the move to Mero was made more complete when the monarchs began to be buried there instead of at Napata. One theory is that this represents the monarchs breaking away from the power of the priests at Napata. According to Diodorus Siculus a Kushite king Ergamenes defied the priests and had them slaughtered. This story may refer to the first ruler to be buried at Mero with a similar name such as Arqamani63 who ruled many years after the royal cemetery was opened at Mero. During this same period the Kushite authority may have extended some 1500 km along the Nile River valley from the Egyptian frontier in the north to areas far south of modern Khartoum and probably also substantial territories to the east and west.64 There is some record of conflict between the Kushites and Ptolemies. In 275 or 274 BC Ptolemy II r. 283246 BC sent an army to Nubia and defeated the Kingdom of Kush annexing to Egypt the area later known as Triakontaschoinos. In addition There was a serious revolt at the end of Ptolemy IV around 204 BC and the Kushites likely tried to interfere in Ptolemaic affairs.5167 It has been suggested that this led to Ptolemy V defacing the name of Arqamani on inscriptions at Philae.5167 Arqamani constructed a small entrance hall to the temple built by Ptolemy IV at selchis and constructed a temple at Philae to which Ptolemy contributed an entrance hall.5166 There is evidence of Ptolemaic occupation as far south as the second cataract but recent finds at Qasr Ibrim such as the total absence of Ptolemaic pottery have cast doubts on the effectiveness of the occupation. Dynastic struggles led to the Ptolemies abandoning the area so the Kushites reasserted their control...with Qasr Ibrim occupied by the Kushites and other locations perhaps garrisoned.5167 According to Welsby after the Romans assumed control of Egypt they negotiated with the Kushites at Philae and drew the southern border of Roman Egypt at Aswan.5167 Theodor Mommsen and Welsby state the Kingdom of Kush became a client Kingdom which was similar to the situation under Ptolemaic rule of Egypt. Kushite ambition and excessive Roman taxation are two theories for a revolt that was supported by Kushite armies.516768 The ancient historians Strabo and Pliny give accounts of the conflict with Roman Egypt. Bronze head of Emperor Augustus found under the staircase of a temple in Meroe Meroitic prince smiting his enemies early first century AD Strabo describes a war with the Romans in the first century BC. According to Strabo the Kushites sacked Aswan with an army of 30000 men and destroyed imperial statues...at Philae. A fine overlifesize bronze head of the emperor Augustus was found buried in Meroe in front of a temple.5168 After the initial victories of Kandake or Candace Amanirenas against Roman Egypt the Kushites were defeated and Napata sacked.65 Remarkably the destruction of the capital of Napata was not a crippling blow to the Kushites and did not frighten Candace enough to prevent her from again engaging in combat with the Roman military. In 22 BC a large Kushite force moved northward with intention of attacking Qasr Ibrim.66149 Alerted to the advance Gaius Petronius prefect of Roman Egypt again marched south and managed to reach Qasr Ibrim and bolster its defenses before the invading Kushites arrived. Welsby states after a Kushite attack on Primis Qasr Ibrim516970 the Kushites sent ambassadors to negotiate a peace settlement with Petronius. The Kushites succeeded in negotiating a peace treaty on favorable terms.65 Trade between the two nations increased66149 and the Roman Egyptian border being extended to Hiera Sykaminos Maharraqa.5170 This arrangement guaranteed peace for most of the next 300 years and there is no definite evidence of further clashes.5170 It is possible that the Roman emperor Nero planned another attempt to conquer Kush before his death in AD 
68.6 6150151 Nero sent two centurions upriver as far as Bahr el Ghazal River in 66 AD in an attempt to discover the source of the Nile per Seneca6143 or plan an attack per Pliny. Decline and falledit Kush began to fade as a power by the first or second century AD sapped by the war with the Roman province of Egypt and the decline of its traditional industries.67 However there is evidence of third century AD Kushite Kings at Philae in demotic and inscription.5171 It has been suggested that the Kushites reoccupied lower Nubia after Roman forces were withdrawn to Aswan. Kushite activities led others to note a de facto Kushite control of that area as far north as Philae for part of the third century AD.5171 Thereafter it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion.citation needed The stele of Aksumite Emperor Ezana commemorating his expedition against the Noba and Kush The fall of Meroe is often associated with an Aksumite invasion.68 An Aksumite presence in Meroe is confirmed by two fragmentary Greek inscriptions.69 The better preserved one referred to military actions and the imposition of a tribute.70 They probably belonged to Aksumite victory monuments and were dedicated to AresMaher the god of war.71 Thus they must have been erected before Aksums conversion to Christianity in around 340 perhaps by king Ousanas r. c. 3103
30.7 2 An inscription from Aksum mentioning Kush as vassal kingdom may also be attributed to Ousanas.73 The trilingual stele of his successor Ezana describes another expedition which happened after 3
40.7 4 Ezanas army followed the course of the Atbara until reaching the Nile confluence where he waged war against Kush.75 Meroe itself is not mentioned suggesting that Ezana did not attack the town.76 Aksums presence in Nubia was likely shortlived.77 Meroitic texts from as early as the 
1 st century BC hint to conflicts with the Noba who lived west of the Nile and were governed by their own chiefs and kings. Perhaps it was the increasingly arid climate that forced them to attack the Nile Valley although they would not manage to break through until the 
4 th century.78 The Ezana stele mentioned that they had occupied Kushite towns79 and were active as far east as the Takeze River where they harassed Aksumite vassals.80 These attacks and them breaking oaths they had sworn to Ezana were the main reason for his Nubian expedition.81 It has been proposed that the Noba were not necessarily Nubianspeakers but that the term Noba was rather a pejorative Meroitic word applied to a large variety of people living outside the Meroitic state.82 A Meroitic stele found at Gebel Adda from around 300 AD however seems to mention a king bearing the Nubian name Trotihi.83 A bowl from a 
4 thcentury elite burial in elHobagi features a MeroiticNubian inscription mentioning a king but identifying the interred individual and the polity he ruled over remains problematic.8384 At Meroe the last pyramids as well as nonroyal burials are dated to the mid
4 th century85 which is conventionally thought to be when the kingdom of Kush came to an end. Afterwards began the socalled postMeroitic period.86 This period saw a decline of urbanism the disappearance of the Meroitic religion and script87 as well as the emergence of regional elites buried in large tumuli.88 Princely burials from Qustul c. 380410 and Ballana 410500 in Lower Nubia are connected to the rise of Nobatia.89 To its north were the Blemmyes who in around 394 established a kingdom centered around Talmis90 that lasted until it was conquered by Nobatia in around 4
50.9 1 The political developments south of the third cataract remain obscure92 but it appears that Dongola the later capital of Makuria as well as Soba the capital of Alodia were founded in that period. Nobatia Makuria and Alodia eventually converted to Christianity in the 
6 th century marking the beginning of medieval Nubia.93 Language and writingedit Meroitic ostracon The Meroitic language was spoken in Mero and Sudan during the Meroitic period attested from 300 BC. It became extinct around 400 AD. It is uncertain to which language family the Meroitic language is a part of. Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic like the Egyptian language belongs to the AfroAsiatic family. She bases this on its sound inventory and phonotactics which she argues are similar to those of the AfroAsiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the NiloSaharan languages.9495 Claude Rilly proposes that Meroitic like the Nobiin language belongs to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the NiloSaharan family based in part on its syntax morphology and known vocabulary.969798 In the Napatan Period Egyptian hieroglyphs were used at this time writing seems to have been restricted to the court and temples. From the second century BC there was a separate Meroitic writing system. The language was written in two forms of the Meroitic alphabet Meroitic Cursive which was written with a stylus and was used for general recordkeeping and Meroitic Hieroglyphic which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of bilingual texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180 and 170 BC. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen Shanakdakhete. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally and reads from right to left.99 This was an alphabetic script with 23 signs used in a hieroglyphic form mainly on monumental art and in a cursive form. The latter was widely used so far some 1278 texts using this version are known Leclant 2000. The script was deciphered by Griffith but the language behind it is still a problem with only a few words understood by modern scholars. It is not as yet possible to connect the Meroitic language with other known languages.49 For a time it was also possibly used to write the Old Nubian language of the successor Nubian kingdoms.100 Technology medicine and mathematicsedit Technologyedit The natives of the Kingdom of Kush developed a type of water wheel or scoop wheel the saqiyah named kol by the Kush.101 The saqiyah was developed during the Meroitic period to improve irrigation. The introduction of this machine had a decisive influence on agriculture especially in Dongola as this wheel lifted water 3 to 8 meters with much less expenditure of labor and time than the shaduf which was the previous chief irrigation device in the kingdom. The shaduf relied on human energy but the saqiyah was driven by buffalos or other animals.101 The people of Kerma ancestors to the Kushites built bronze kilns through which they manufactured objects of daily use such as razors mirrors and tweezers.102 The Great Hafir reservoir at Musawwarat esSufra The Kushites developed a form of reservoir known as a hafir during the Meroitic period. Eight hundred ancient and modern hafirs have been registered in the Meroitic town of Butana.103 The functions of hafirs were to catch water during the rainy season for storage to ensure water is available for several months during the dry season as well as supply drinking water irrigate fields and water cattle.103 The Great Hafir or Great Reservoir near the Lion Temple in Musawwarat esSufra is a notable hafir built by the Kushites.104 It was built to retain the rainfall of the short wet season. It is 250 m in diameter and 
6.3  m deep.104103 Bloomeries and blast furnaces could have been used in metalworking at Mero.105 Early records of bloomery furnaces dated at least to seventh and sixth century BC have been discovered in Kush. The ancient bloomeries that produced metal tools for the Kushites produced a surplus for sale.106107108 Medicineedit Nubian mummies studied in the 19
90 s revealed that Kush was a pioneer of early antibiotics.109 Tetracycline was being used by Nubians based on bone remains between 350 AD and 550 AD. The antibiotic was in wide commercial use only in the mid 
20 th century. The theory states that earthen jars containing grain used for making beer contained the bacterium streptomyces which produced tetracycline. Although Nubians were not aware of tetracycline they could have noticed that people fared better by drinking beer. According to Charlie Bamforth a professor of biochemistry and brewing science at the University of California Davis They must have consumed it because it was rather tastier than the grain from which it was derived. They would have noticed people fared better by consuming this product than they were just consuming the grain itself.110 Mathematicsedit Based on engraved plans of Meroitic King Amanikhabalis pyramids Nubians had a sophisticated understanding of mathematics as they appreciated the harmonic ratio. The engraved plans is indicative of much to be revealed about Nubian mathematics.111 The ancient Nubians also established a system of geometry which they used in creating early versions of sun clocks.112113 During the Meroitic period in Nubian history the Nubians used a trigonometric methodology similar to the Egyptians.114 Militaryedit Main article Military of ancient Nubia Relief of a battle scene on temple Meroe 250 also known as Sun Temple 
1 st century AD During the siege of Hermopolis in the eighth century BC siege towers were built for the Kushite army led by Piye in order to enhance the efficiency of Kushite archers and slingers.115 After leaving Thebes Piyes first objective was besieging Ashmunein. Following his armys lack of success he undertook the personal supervision of operations including the erection of a siege tower from which Kushite archers could fire down into the city.116 Early shelters protecting sappers armed with poles trying to breach mudbrick ramparts gave way to battering rams.115 Bowmen were the most important force components in the Kushite military.117 Ancient sourceswhichwho indicate that Kushite archers favored onepiece bows that were between six and seven feet long with a draw strength so powerful that many of the archers used their feet to bend their bows. However composite bows were also used in their arsenal.117 Greek historian Herodotus indicated that primary bow construction was of seasoned palm wood with arrows made of cane.117 Kushite arrows were often poisonedtipped. Elephants were occasionally used in warfare during the Meroitic period as seen in the war against Rome around 20 BC.118 Architectureedit The pyramids of Meroe  UNESCO World Heritage.119 Main article Nubian pyramids Amun temple of Jebel Barkal originally built during the Egyptian New Kingdom but greatly enhanced by Piye During the Bronze Age Nubian ancestors of the Kingdom of Kush built speoi a speos is a temple or tomb cut into a rock face between 3700 and 3250 BC. This greatly influenced the architecture of the New Kingdom of Egypt.120 Tomb monuments were one of the more recognizable expressions of Kushite architecture. Uniquely Kushite tomb monuments were found from the beginning of the empire at el Kurru to the decline of the kingdom. These monuments developed organically from Middle Nile e.g. Agroup burial types. Tombs became progressively larger during the 
25 th dynasty culminating in Taharqas underground rectangular building with aisles of square piers...the whole being cut from the living rock.51103 Kushites also created pyramids121122 mudbrick temples deffufa and masonry temples.123124 Kushites borrowed much from Egypt as it relates to temple design. Kushite temples were quite diverse in their plans except for the Amun temples which all have the same basic plan. The Jebel Barkal and Meroe Amun temples are exceptions with the 150 m long Jebel Barkal being by far the largest Egyptian temple ever built in Nubia.51118 Temples for major Egyptian deities were built on a system of internal harmonic proportions based on one or more rectangles each with sides in the ratio of 8551133125 Kush also invented Nubian vaults. The socalled Roman kiosk right and temple of Apedemak left Naqa 
1 st century AD Piye is thought to have constructed the first true pyramid at el Kurru. Pyramids are the archetypal tomb monument of the Kushite royal family and found at el Kurru Nuri Jebel Barkal and Meroe.51105 The Kushite pyramids are smaller with steeper sides than northern Egyptian pyramids. The Kushites are thought to have copied the pyramids of New Kingdom elites as opposed to Old and Middle Kingdom pharaohs.51105106 Kushite housing consisted mostly of circular timber huts with some apartment houses with several tworoom apartments. The apartment houses likely accommodated extended families.citation needed The Kushites built a stonepaved road at Jebel Barkal are thought to have built piersharbors on the Nile river and many wells.126 Economyedit Hieratic papyrus written during the reigns of Taharqa and Shabaqa discussing financial matters Thebes Some scholarswho believe the economy in the Kingdom of Kush was a redistributive system. The state would collect taxes in the form of surplus produce and would redistribute it to the people. Others believe that most of the society worked on the land and required nothing from the state and did not contribute to the state. Northern Kush seems to have been more productive and wealthier than the Southern area.127 Kush and Egyptologyedit On account of the Kingdom of Kushs proximity to Ancient Egypt  the first cataract at Elephantine usually being considered the traditional border between the two polities  and because the 
25 th dynasty ruled over both states in the eighth century BC from the Rift Valley to the Taurus mountains historians have closely associated the study of Kush with Egyptology in keeping with the general assumption that the complex sociopolitical development of Egypts neighbors can be understood in terms of Egyptian models.citation needed As a result the political structure and organization of Kush as an independent ancient state has not received as thorough attention from scholars and there remains much ambiguity especially surrounding the earliest periods of the state.citation needed Edwards has suggested that the study of the region could benefit from increased recognition of Kush as a state in its own right with distinct cultural conditions rather than merely as a secondary state on the periphery of Egypt.128 Galleryedit Portrait of Taharqa Kerma Museum The Archer King an unknown king of Meroe
