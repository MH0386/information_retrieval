2.4 3 m width 920 cm Created c. 2250 BC Discovered 1932 or 1933 Giza Egypt Discovered by Gustave Jequier The South Saqqara Stone is the lid of the sarcophagus of the ancient Egyptian queen Ankhesenpepi I which was inscribed with a list for the reigns of the pharaohs of the 
6 th Dynasty from Teti Userkare Pepi I Merenre to the early years of Pepi II under whom the document was likely created. It is essentially an annal document which records events in each year of a kings reign unfortunately it was reused in antiquity for Ankhesenpepi Is burial and many of its invaluable inscriptions have been erased. Discoveryedit The South Saqqara Stone was discovered in 1932 or 1933 by Gustave Jquier in the westernmost of five storerooms south of the pyramid of Queen Iput II within the pyramid complex of Pepi II during whose reign it was created at Saqqara. Descriptionedit Made of basalt it measures 
2.4 3 metres by 
0.9 2 metres and is 20 centimetres thick. It is inscribed on both sides but much of the inscription is erased and unreadable. The recto appears to list events of the reigns of Teti Userkare Pepi I and Merenre the verso describes the second part of the reign of Merenra and part of Pepi IIs. Significanceedit The importance of the South Saqqara Stone stems from its inscription a list of a number of pharaohs along with details of annual or biannual cattle counts which confirm details in other sources such as the Turin King List and allow archaeologists to estimate the length of their reigns. Michel Baud and Vassil Dobrev estimate at least 12 years of reign for Teti 24 years for Userkare 4950 years for Pepi I and at least 1113 years for Merenre based on an estimate on the size of the preserved year the size of each year blocks and the location of certain cattle counts such as the Year of the 
18 th and 
25 th counts for Pepi I and his Year after the 
23 rd count or the Year of and the Year after the 
2 nd count for Merenre within this document. The Stone is considered one of the earliest historical documents in existence as it is not merely a list of dynastic ancestors for the ruling pharaoh but includes the names of all preceding pharaohs known to the artefacts creators including shadowy rulers such as Userkare.
