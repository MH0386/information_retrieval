Set had a positive role where he accompanies Ra on his barque to repel Apep the serpent of Chaos.6269 Set had a vital role as a reconciled combatant.6269 He was lord of the Red Land desert where he was the balance to Horus role as lord of the Black Land fertile land.6269 In the Osiris myth the most important Egyptian myth Set is portrayed as the usurper who murdered and mutilated his own brother Osiris. Osiriss sisterwife Isis reassembled his corpse and resurrected her dead brotherhusband with the help of the goddess Nephthys. The resurrection lasted long enough to conceive his son and heir Horus. Horus sought revenge upon Set and many of the ancient Egyptian myths describe their conflicts.7 In ancient Egyptian astronomy Set was commonly associated with the planet Mercury.8 Familyedit Set and Nephthys 12791213 BCE stone Louvre Set is the son of Geb the Earth and Nut the Sky his siblings are Osiris Isis and Nephthys. He married Nephthys and fathered Anubis and Wepwawet.1 In some accounts he had relationships with the foreign goddesses Anat and Astarte.6270 From these relationships is said to be born a crocodile deity called Maga.9 Name originedit The meaning of the name Set is unknown but it is thought to have been originally pronounced sti suw.tix based on spellings of his name in Egyptian hieroglyphs as st and swt.10 The Late Egyptian spelling st reflects the palatalization of  while the eventual loss of the final consonant is recorded in spellings like swtj.11 The Coptic form of the name  St is the basis for the English vocalization.1012 Set animaledit Main article Set animal or or top Sutekh with the Set animal determinative middle Set below Sutekh  another written form in hieroglyphs The setanimal Sha after an original by E. A. Wallis Budge.page needed In art Set is usually depicted as an enigmatic creature referred to by Egyptologists as the Set animal a beast not identified with any known animal although it could be seen as a resembling an aardvark an African wild dog a donkey a hyena a jackal a pig an antelope a giraffe or a fennec fox. The animal has a downward curving snout long ears with squaredoff ends a thin forked tail with sprouted fur tufts in an inverted arrow shape and a slender canine body. Sometimes Set is depicted as a human with the distinctive head. Some early Egyptologists proposed that it was a stylised representation of the giraffe owing to the large flattopped horns which correspond to a giraffes ossicones. The Egyptians themselves however used distinct depictions for the giraffe and the Set animal. During the Late Period Set is usually depicted as a donkey or as a man with the head of a donkey13 and in the Book of the Faiyum Set is depicted with a flamingo head.14 The earliest representations of what might be the Set animal comes from a tomb dating to the Amratian culture Naqada I of prehistoric Egypt 37903500 BCE although this identification is uncertain. If these are ruled out then the earliest Set animal appears on a ceremonial macehead of Scorpion II a ruler of the Naqada III phase. The head and the forked tail of the Set animal are clearly present on the mace.15 Conflict of Horus and Setedit Set and Horus binding together upper and lower Egypt An important element of Sets mythology was his conflict with his brother or nephew Horus for the throne of Egypt. The contest between them is often violent but is also described as a legal judgment before the Ennead an assembled group of Egyptian deities to decide who should inherit the kingship. The judge in this trial may be Geb who as the father of Osiris and Set held the throne before they did or it may be the creator gods Ra or Atum the originators of kingship.16 Other deities also take important roles Thoth frequently acts as a conciliator in the dispute17 or as an assistant to the divine judge and in Contendings Isis uses her cunning and magical power to aid her son.18 The rivalry of Horus and Set is portrayed in two contrasting ways. Both perspectives appear as early as the Pyramid Texts the earliest source of the myth. In some spells from these texts Horus is the son of Osiris and nephew of Set and the murder of Osiris is the major impetus for the conflict. The other tradition depicts Horus and Set as brothers.19 This incongruity persists in many of the subsequent sources where the two gods may be called brothers or uncle and nephew at different points in the same text.20 Horus spears Set who appears in the form of a hippopotamus as Isis looks on The divine struggle involves many episodes. Contendings describes the two gods appealing to various other deities to arbitrate the dispute and competing in different types of contests such as racing in boats or fighting each other in the form of hippopotami to determine a victor. In this account Horus repeatedly defeats Set and is supported by most of the other deities.21 Yet the dispute drags on for eighty years largely because the judge the creator god favors Set.22 In late ritual texts the conflict is characterized as a great battle involving the two deities assembled followers.23 The strife in the divine realm extends beyond the two combatants. At one point Isis attempts to harpoon Set as he is locked in combat with her son but she strikes Horus instead who then cuts off her head in a fit of rage.24 Thoth replaces Isiss head with that of a cow the story gives a mythical origin for the cowhorn headdress that Isis commonly wears.25 In a key episode in the conflict Set sexually abuses Horus. Sets violation is partly meant to degrade his rival but it also involves homosexual desire in keeping with one of Sets major characteristics his forceful potent and indiscriminate sexuality.26 In the earliest account of this episode in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus the sexual encounter begins when Set asks to have sex with Horus who agrees on the condition that Set will give Horus some of his strength.27 The encounter puts Horus in danger because in Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance akin to poison. According to some texts Sets semen enters Horuss body and makes him ill but in Contendings Horus thwarts Set by catching Sets semen in his hands. Isis retaliates by putting Horuss semen on lettuceleaves that Set eats. Sets defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He has been impregnated with his rivals seed and as a result gives birth to the disk. In Contendings Thoth takes the disk and places it on his own head in earlier accounts it is Thoth who is produced by this anomalous birth.28 Another important episode concerns mutilations that the combatants inflict upon each other Horus injures or steals Sets testicles and Set damages or tears out one or occasionally both of Horuss eyes. Sometimes the eye is torn into pieces.29 Sets mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength.30 The removal of Horuss eye is even more important for this stolen eye of Horus represents a wide variety of concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horuss major roles is as a sky deity and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye or other deities including Isis Thoth and Hathor may retrieve or heal it for him.29 Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Sets loss of semen to Horus and that the moonlike disk that emerges from Sets head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him Horus retaliates and impregnates Set and Set comes into possession of Horuss eye when it appears on Sets head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions it would make sense according to te Velde for Thoth to emerge in the form of the Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.31 In any case the restoration of the eye of Horus to wholeness represents the return of the moon to full brightness32 the return of the kingship to Horus33 and many other aspects of maat.34 Sometimes the restoration of Horuss eye is accompanied by the restoration of Sets testicles so that both gods are made whole near the conclusion of their feud.35 Protector of Raedit Mesektet Barque with Ra as Set spears Apep in the underworld Set was depicted standing on the prow of Ras barge defeating the dark serpent Apep. In some Late Period representations such as in the Persian Period Temple of Hibis at Khargah Set was represented in this role with a falcons head taking on the guise of Horus. In the Amduat Set is described as having a key role in overcoming Apep. Set in the Second Intermediate Ramesside and later periodsedit Set and Horus adore Ramesses in the small temple at Abu Simbel. During the Second Intermediate Period 16501550 BCE a group of Near Eastern peoples known as the Hyksos literally rulers of foreign lands gained control of Lower Egypt and ruled the Nile Delta from Avaris. They chose Set originally Upper Egypts chief god the god of foreigners and the god they found most similar to their own chief god Hadad as their patroncitation needed. Set then became worshiped as the chief god once again. The Hyksos King Apophis is recorded as worshiping Set exclusively as described in the following passage36 King Apophis chose for his Lord the god Seth. He did not worship any other deity in the whole land except Seth.b The Quarrel of Apophis and Seqenenre Papyrus Sallier I 
1.2 3 British Museum No. 1018539 Jan Assmann argues that because the ancient Egyptians could never conceive of a lonely god lacking personality Seth the desert god who was worshiped on his own represented a manifestation of evil.40 When Ahmose I overthrew the Hyksos and expelled them in c.1522 BCE Egyptians attitudes towards Asiatic foreigners became xenophobic and royal propaganda discredited the period of Hyksos rule. The Set cult at Avaris flourished nevertheless and the Egyptian garrison of Ahmose stationed there became part of the priesthood of Set.citation needed The founder of the Nineteenth Dynasty Ramesses I came from a military family from Avaris with strong ties to the priesthood of Set. Several of the Ramesside kings were named after the god most notably Seti I literally man of Set and Setnakht literally Set is strong. In addition one of the garrisons of Ramesses II held Set as its patron deity and Ramesses II erected the socalled Year 400 Stela at PiRamesses commemorating the 4
00 th anniversary of the Set cult in the Nile delta.41 Set also became associated with foreign gods during the New Kingdom particularly in the delta. Set was identified by the Egyptians with the Hittite deity Teshub who like Set was a storm god and the Canaanite deity Baal being worshipped together as SethBaal.42 Additionally Set is depicted in part of the Greek Magical Papyri a body of texts forming a grimoire used in GrecoRoman magic during the fourth century CE.43 The demonization of Setedit Set on a late New Kingdom relief from Karnak his figure was erased during his demonization. According to Herman te Velde the demonization of Set took place after Egypts conquest by several foreign nations in the Third Intermediate and Late Periods. Set who had traditionally been the god of foreigners thus also became associated with foreign oppressors including the Kushite and Persian empires.44 It was during this time that Set was particularly vilified and his defeat by Horus widely celebrated. Sets negative aspects were emphasized during this period. Set was the killer of Osiris having hacked Osiris body into pieces and dispersed it so that he could not be resurrected. The Greeks would later associate Set with Typhon and Yahweh a monstrous and evil force of raging nature being the three of them depicted as donkeylike creatures classifying their worshippers as onolatrists.45 Set and Typhon also had in common that both were sons of deities representing the Earth Gaia and Geb who attacked the principal deities Osiris for Set Zeus for Typhon.citation needed Nevertheless throughout this period in some outlying regions of Egypt Set was still regarded as the heroic chief deity.citation needed Ancient Egyptologist Dr. Kara Cooney shot an episode called The Birth of the Devil in the Out of Egypt documentary series.46 In this documentary the scientist describes the process of demonization of Set and the positioning of the it as absolute evil on the opposite side in parallel with the transition to monotheism in different regions from Rome to India where God began to be perceived as the representative of absolute goodness. Set templesedit Limestone architectural fragment a door jamb part of a doorway. From the temple of Set which was built by Thutmosis III at Ombos Egypt. 
18 th Dynasty. The Petrie Museum Set was worshipped at the temples of Ombos Nubt near Naqada and Ombos Nubt near Kom Ombo at Oxyrhynchus in Upper Egypt and also in part of the Fayyum area. More specifically Set was worshipped in the relatively large metropolitan yet provincial locale of Sepermeru especially during the Ramesside Period.47 There Seth was honored with an important temple called the House of Seth Lord of Sepermeru. One of the epithets of this town was gateway to the desert which fits well with Sets role as a deity of the frontier regions of ancient Egypt. At Sepermeru Sets temple enclosure included a small secondary shrine called The House of Seth PowerfulIsHisMightyArm and Ramesses II himself built or modified a second landowning temple for Nephthys called The House of Nephthys of RamessesMeriamun.48 The two temples of Seth and Nephthys in Sepermeru were under separate administration each with its own holdings and prophets.49 Moreover another moderately sized temple of Seth is noted for the nearby town of PiWayna.48 The close association of Seth temples with temples of Nephthys in key outskirttowns of this milieu is also reflected in the likelihood that there existed another House of Seth and another House of Nephthys in the town of Su at the entrance to the Fayyum.50 Papyrus Bologna preserves a most irritable complaint lodged by one Praemhab Prophet of the House of Seth in the nowlost town of Punodjem The Sweet Place. In the text of Papyrus Bologna the harried Praemhab laments undue taxation for his own temple The House of Seth and goes on to lament that he is also saddled with responsibility for The ship and I am likewise also responsible for the House of Nephthys along with the remaining heap of district temples.51 Nothing is known about the particular theologies of the closely connected Set and Nephthys temples in these districts  for example the religious tone of temples of Nephthys located in such proximity to those of Seth especially given the seemingly contrary Osirian loyalties of Seths consortgoddess. When by the Twentieth Dynasty the demonization of Seth was ostensibly inaugurated Seth was either eradicated or increasingly pushed to the outskirts Nephthys flourished as part of the usual Osirian pantheon throughout Egypt even obtaining a Late Period status as tutelary goddess of her own Nome UU Nome VII HwtSekhemDiospolis Parva and as the chief goddess of the Mansion of the Sistrum in that district.52535455 Seths cult persisted even into the latter days of ancient Egyptian religion in outlying but important places like Kharga Dakhlah Deir elHagar Mut and Kellis. In these places Seth was considered Lord of the Oasis  Town and Nephthys was likewise venerated as Mistress of the Oasis at Seths side in his temples56 esp. the dedication of a Nephthyscult statue. Meanwhile Nephthys was also venerated as Mistress in the Osirian temples of these districts as part of the specifically Osirian college.56 It would appear that the ancient Egyptians in these locales had little problem with the paradoxical dualities inherent in venerating Seth and Nephthys as juxtaposed against Osiris Isis and Nephthys. In modern religionedit Main articles Kemetism Temple of Set and Sethian Liberation Movement In popular cultureedit In the manga and anime series JoJos Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders a minor enemy named Alessi has a Stand based on Set with the ability to reflect Alessis shadow including items he holds and can rapidly deage whoever steps into his shadow.57 In the 
13 th season Doctor Who serial Pyramids of Mars Set using the name Sutekh is portrayed as an alien entity. Imprisoned under an Egyptian pyramid millennia ago by Horus he is bent on destroying all life if he is ever freed. In the roleplaying game Vampire The Masquerade the ancient Egyptian deity Set is depicted as an antediluvian vampire believed to be one of the oldest undead beings. Revered as the founder of the enigmatic Followers of Set now known as The Ministry in the games fifth edition. Imprisoned in torpor Set remains a focal point for his followers who strive to rouse him from his slumber. He commands powers entwined with manipulation darkness and serpentine subtlety epitomized by his unique Discipline Serpentis dedicated to the mastery of serpents. In the Shin Megami Tensei series Set using the name Seth is portrayed as a black dragon throughout multiple of the installments. In the 1992 Nintendo Entertainment System video game Nightshade the villains public persona is that of Sutekh a criminal underboss who unifies the gangs of the fictitious Metro City. In line with the idea of Sutekh of Egyptian mythology the Sutekh in the video game reigns supreme over all of the violence in the city. Of particular note in Egyptian mythology Sutekh is also the god of foreigners. In the Nightshade video game its villain is not of Egyptian descent but instead a man by the name of Waldo P. Schmeer who is a historian obsessed with Egyptian lore. Sutekh is an antagonist in some films and other material in the Puppet Master universe. Sutekh is portrayed as the other worldly owner of the secret of life which animates the eponymous puppets and stalks anyone who steals it. In SMITE Set is a playable assassin released alongside his rival nephew Horus. In the BL manhwa ENNEAD written and illustrated by Mojito Set using the name Seth is the main character. It draws heavily upon classic Egyptian mythology and centers on the conflict between Horus and Seth. Ahead of the release of their 
25 th studio album The Silver Cord King Gizzard  the Lizard Wizard album Australian band King Gizzard  the Lizard Wizard released the albums first three songs.58 The third of these titled Set describes Set killing Osiris and his subsequent conflict with Horus. See alsoedit Set animal Notesedit  Also transliterated Sheth Setesh Sutekh Seteh Setekh or Suty. Sutekh appears in fact as a god of Hittites in the treaty declarations between the Hittite kings and Ramses II after the battle of Qadesh. Probably Seteh is the lection reading of a god honoured by the Hittites the Kheta afterward assimilated to the local AfroAsiatic Seth.45  Translation from Assmann 2008 p. 48. Goedickes translation And then King Apophis l.p.h. was appointing for himself Sutekh as Lord. He never worked for any other god which is in this entire country except Sutekh.37 Goldwassers translation Then king Apophis l.p.h. adopted for himself Seth as lord and he refused to serve any god that was in the entire land except Seth.38 Referencesedit  a b Set.
