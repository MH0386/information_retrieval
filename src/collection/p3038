The last emperor from the Severan dynasty he succeeded his slain cousin Elagabalus in 222 at the age of 13. Alexander himself was eventually assassinated and his death marked the beginning of the events of the Crisis of the Third Century which included nearly fifty years of civil war foreign invasion and the collapse of the monetary economy. Alexander was the heir to his cousin the 
18 yearold Emperor Elagabalus. The latter had been murdered along with his mother Julia Soaemias by his own guards who as a mark of contempt had their remains cast into the Tiber river.3 Alexander and his cousin were both grandsons of Julia Maesa who was the sister of empress Julia Domna and had arranged for Elagabaluss acclamation as emperor by the Third Gallic Legion. Alexanders 
13 year reign was the longest reign of a sole emperor since Antoninus Pius.4 He was also the second youngest sole Roman emperor of a united empire after Gordian III. Alexanders peacetime reign was prosperous. However Rome was militarily confronted with the rising Sassanid Empire and growing incursions from the tribes of Germania. He managed to check the threat of the Sassanids. But when campaigning against Germanic tribes Alexander attempted to bring peace by engaging in diplomacy and bribery. This alienated many in the Roman army leading to a conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of Alexander his mother Julia Avita Mamaea and his advisors. After their deaths the accession of Maximinus Thrax followed. Alexanders death marked the epoch event for the Crisis of the Third Century. Early lifeedit The future emperor Severus Alexander was born on 1 October 208 in Arca Caesarea Phoenicia.567 Of his birth name only two cognomina are known from literary sources Bassianus Greek  according to the historian Cassius Dio and Alexianus Greek  according to Herodian. Bassianus was also borne by several family members while Alexianus was probably later converted to Alexander.8 The historian Cassius Dio thought Alexianus was the son of Marcus Julius Gessius Marcianus but Icks disputes this saying the latter could not have married the emperors mother before 212 and that Alexianus must have been fathered by his mothers first husband who is of unknown name but of certain existence.9 The priest Marcus Julius Gessius Bassianus may have been his younger brother.10 Emperoredit Early reignedit Bust of young Severus Alexander Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek Copenhagen Severus Alexander became emperor when he was around 14 years old making him the youngest emperor in Romes history.11 Alexanders grandmother Maesa believed that he had more potential to rule and gain support from the Praetorian Guard than her other grandson the increasingly unpopular emperor Elagabalus.12 Thus to preserve her own position she had Elagabalus adopt the young Alexander and then arranged for Elagabalus assassination securing the throne for Alexander.13 The Roman army hailed Alexander as emperor on 13 March 222 immediately conferring on him the titles of Pater Patriae and Pontifex maximus on the following day.14 Throughout his life Alexander relied heavily on guidance from his grandmother Maesa before her death in 224 and mother Julia Mamaea.12 As a young immature and inexperienced adolescent Alexander knew little about government warcraft or the role of ruling over an empire. In time however the army came to admire what Jasper Burns refers to as his simple virtues and moderate behavior so different from Elagabalus.12 Domestic achievementsedit Under the influence of his mother Alexander did much to improve the morals and condition of the people and to enhance the dignity of the state.7 He employed noted jurists such as Ulpian2 to oversee the administration of justice.15 His advisers were men like the senator and historian Cassius Dio and historical sources claimed that with the help of his family he created a select board of 16 senators16 although this claim is sometimes disputed.17 Some scholars have rejected Herodians view that Alexander expanded senatorial powers.18 He also created a municipal council of 14 who assisted the urban prefect in administering the affairs of the 14 districts of Rome.19 Excessive luxury and extravagance at the imperial court were diminished20 and he restored the Baths of Nero in 227 or 229 consequently they are sometimes also known as the Baths of Alexander after him. He extended the imperial residence at the Horti Lamiani on the Esquiline Hill with elaborate buildings and created the Nymphaeum of Alexander known as the Trophies of Marius which still stands in the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele. This was the great fountain he built at the end of the Aqua Claudia aqueduct. Upon his accession he reduced the silver purity of the denarius from 
46.5  to 43  the actual silver weight dropped from 
1.4 1 grams to 
1.3 0 grams however in 229 he revalued the denarius increasing the silver purity and weight to 45 and 
1.4 6 grams. The following year he decreased the amount of base metal in the denarius while adding more silver raising the silver purity and weight again to 
50.5  and 
1.5 0 grams.21 Additionally during his reign taxes were lightened literature art and science were encouraged22 and for the convenience of the people loan offices were instituted for lending money at a moderate rate of interest.23 In religious matters Alexander preserved an open mind. According to the Historia Augusta he wished to erect a temple to Jesus but was dissuaded by the pagan priests however this claim is unreliable as the Historia Augusta is considered untrustworthy by historians containing significant amounts of information that is false and even invented extending to when it was written and the number of authors it was written by.2425 He allowed a synagogue to be built in Rome and he gave as a gift to this synagogue a scroll of the Torah known as the Severus Scroll.26 In legal matters Alexander did much to aid the rights of his soldiers. He confirmed that soldiers could name anyone as heirs in their will whereas civilians had strict restrictions over who could become heirs or receive a legacy.27 He also confirmed that soldiers could free their slaves in their wills28 protected the rights of soldiers to their property when they were on campaign29 and reasserted that a soldiers property acquired in or because of military service his castrense peculium could be claimed by no one else not even the soldiers father.30 Persian Waredit On the whole Alexanders reign was prosperous until the rise of the Sassanids31 under Ardashir I.32 In 231 AD Ardashir invaded the Roman provinces of the east overrunning Mesopotamia and penetrating possibly as far as Syria and Cappadocia forcing from the young Alexander a vigorous response.33 Of the war that followed there are various accounts. According to the most detailed authority Herodian the Roman armies suffered a number of humiliating setbacks and defeats34 while according to the Historia Augusta35 as well as Alexanders own dispatch to the Roman Senate he gained great victories.36 Making Antioch his base he organized in 233 a threefold invasion of the Sassanian Empire at the head of the main body he himself advanced to recapture northern Mesopotamia while another army invaded Media through the mountains of Armenia and a third advanced from the south in the direction of Babylon. The northernmost army gained some success fighting in mountainous territory favorable to the Roman infantry but the southern army was surrounded and destroyed by Ardashirs skilful horsearchers and Alexander himself retreated after an indecisive campaign his army wracked by indiscipline and disease.3738 Further losses were incurred by the retreating northern army in the inclement cold of Armenia as it retired into winter quarters due to a failure through incompetence to establish adequate supply lines.3937 Still Mesopotamia was retaken and Ardashir was not thereafter able to extend his conquests though his son Shapur would obtain some success later in the century.37 Although the Sassanids were checked for the time36 the conduct of the Roman army showed an extraordinary lack of discipline. In 232 there was a mutiny in the Syrian legion which proclaimed Taurinus emperor.40 Alexander managed to suppress the uprising and Taurinus drowned while attempting to flee across the Euphrates.41 The emperor returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph in 2
33.3 6 Military disciplineedit Denarii of Alexander marked IMP. ALEXANDER PIVS AVG. Alexanders reign was also characterized by a significant breakdown of military discipline.42 In 228 the Praetorian Guard murdered their prefect Ulpian42 in Alexanders presence. Alexander could not openly punish the ringleader of the riot and instead removed him to a nominal post of honor in Egypt and then Crete where he was quietly put out of the way sometime after the excitement had abated.43 The soldiers then fought a threeday battle against the populace of Rome and this battle ended after several parts of the city were set on fire.44 Dio was among those who gave a highly critical account of military discipline during the time saying that the soldiers would rather just surrender to the enemy.44 Different reasons are given for this issue Campbell points to ...the decline in the prestige of the Severan dynasty the feeble nature of Alexander himself who appeared to be no soldier and to be completely dominated by his mothers advice and lack of real military success at a time during which the empire was coming under increasing pressure.44 Herodian on the other hand was convinced that the emperors miserliness partly the result of his mothers greed and slowness to bestow donatives were instrumental in the fall of military discipline under Alexander.44 Germanic Waredit Aureus of Alexander minted in 222 and 228 marked IMP. C. M. AUR. SEV. ALEXAND. AVG. After the Persian war Alexander returned to Antioch with Origen one of the Fathers of the Christian Church. Alexanders mother Julia Mamaea asked for Origen to tutor Alexander in Christianity.45 While Alexander was being educated in the Christian doctrines the northern portion of his empire was being invaded by Germanic and Sarmatian tribes. A new and menacing enemy started to emerge directly after Alexanders success in the Persian war. In 234 the barbarians crossed the Rhine and Danube in hordes that caused alarm as far as Rome. The soldiers serving under Alexander already demoralized after their costly war against the Persians were further discontented with their emperor when their homes were destroyed by the barbarian invaders.46 As word of the invasion spread the emperor took the front line and went to battle against the Germanic invaders. The Romans prepared heavily for the war building a fleet to carry the entire army across. However at this point in Alexanders career he still knew little about being a general. Because of this he hoped the mere threat of his armies would be sufficient to persuade the hostile tribes to surrender.47 Severus enforced a strict military discipline in his men that sparked a rebellion among his legions.48 Due to incurring heavy losses against the Persians and on the advice of his mother Alexander attempted to buy the Germanic tribes off so as to gain time.49 It was this decision that resulted in the legionaries looking down upon Alexander. They considered him dishonorable and feared he was unfit to be Emperor. Under these circumstances the army swiftly looked to replace Alexander.50 Gaius Julius Verus Maximinus was the next best option. He was a soldier from Thrace who had a golden reputation and was working hard to increase his military status.48 He was also a man with superior personal strength who rose to his present position from a peasant background. With the Thracians hailing came the end of the Severan Dynasty51 and with the growing animosity of Severus army towards him the path for his assassination was paved. Assassinationedit Bust of Severus Alexander Muse SaintRaymond Toulouse Alexander was forced to face his German enemies in the early months of 235. By the time he and his mother arrived the situation had settled and so his mother convinced him that to avoid violence trying to bribe the German army to surrender was the more sensible course of action.52 According to historians it was this tactic combined with insubordination from his own men that destroyed his reputation and popularity.53 Alexander was thus assassinated together with his mother on 21 or 22 March545556 in a mutiny of the Legio XXII Primigenia at Moguntiacum Mainz while at a meeting with his generals.57 These assassinations secured the throne for Maximinus.7 The Historia Augusta documents two theories that elaborate on Severuss assassination. The first claims that the disaffection of Mamaea was the main motive behind the homicide. However Lampridius makes it clear that he is more supportive of an alternative theory that Alexander was murdered in Sicilia located in Britain.58 This theory has it that in an open tent after his lunch Alexander was consulting with his insubordinate troops who compared him to his cousin Elagabalus the divisive and unpopular Emperor whose own assassination paved the way for Alexanders reign. A German servant entered the tent and initiated the call for Alexanders assassination at which point many of the troops joined in the attack. Alexanders attendants fought against the other troops but could not hold off the combined might of those seeking the Emperors assassination. Within minutes Alexander was dead. His mother Julia Mamaea was in the same tent with Alexander and soon fell victim to the same group of assassins.53 Alexanders body was buried together with the body of his mother Julia Mamaea in a mausoleum in Rome. The actual mausoleum called Monte del Grano it is the third largest in Rome after those of Hadrian and Augustus. It is still visible in Piazza dei Tribuni in the Quadraro area in Rome where it resembles a large earth mound. The large sarcophagus found inside the tomb in the 
16 th century and which contained the emperors remains is in the Palazzo dei Conservatori Museum in Rome. According to some sources inside the same sarcophagus in 1582 a precious glass urn was found the Portland Vase currently on display at the British Museum in London. Legacyedit Alexanders death marked the end of the Severan dynasty. He was the last of the Syrian emperors and the first emperor to be overthrown by military discontent on a wide scale.59 After his death his economic policies were completely discarded and the Roman currency was devalued this signaled the beginning of the chaotic period known as the Crisis of the Third Century which brought the empire to the brink of collapse.51 Alexanders death at the hands of his troops can also be seen as the heralding of a new role for Roman emperors. Though they were not yet expected to personally fight in battle during Alexanders time emperors were increasingly expected to display general competence in military affairs.60 Thus Alexanders taking of his mothers advice to not get involved in battle his dishonorable and unsoldierly methods of dealing with the Germanic threat and the relative failure of his military campaign against the Persians were all deemed highly unacceptable by the soldiers.60 Indeed Maximinus was able to overthrow Alexander by harping on his own military excellence in contrast to that feeble coward.60 Yet by arrogating the power to dethrone their emperor the legions paved the way for a halfcentury of widespread chaos and instability. The Portland Vase Alexander was deified after the death of Maximinus in 2
38.6 1 Portland Vaseedit Perhaps his most tangible legacy was the emergence in the 
16 th century of the cameo glass Portland Vase or Barberini Vase dated to around the reign of Augustus. This was allegedly found at the mausoleum of the emperor and his family at Monte Del Grano. The discovery of the vase is described by Pietro Santi Bartoli.62 Pietro Bartoli indicates that the vase contained the ashes of Severus Alexander. However this together with the interpretations of the scenes depicted are the source of countless theories and disputed facts. The vase passed through the hands of Sir William Hamilton Ambassador to the Royal Court in Naples and in 1784 was sold to the Duchess of Portland and has subsequently been known as the Portland Vase.63 After an attack by a disturbed man in the British Museum in 1845 smashed it into many fragments the vase has been reconstructed three times. In 1786 the Portland vase had been borrowed from the 
3 rd Duke of Portland and copied in black Jasperware pottery by Josiah Wedgwood for his firm Wedgwood. He appears to have added some drapery to cover nudity but his replicas were useful in the reconstructions. Personal lifeedit According to the Historia Augusta Alexanders chief amusement consisted in having young dogs play with little pigs.64 Herodian portrays him as a mothers boy. Familyedit Denarius of Sallustia Orbiana. Inscription SALL. BARBIA ORBIANA AVG. Alexanders only known wife was Sallustia Orbiana Augusta whom he married in 225 when she was 16 years old. Their marriage was arranged by Alexanders mother Mamaea.2 According to historian Herodian however as soon as Orbiana received the title of Augusta Mamaea became increasingly jealous and resentful of Alexanders wife due to Mamaeas excessive desire of all regal female titles.7 Alexander divorced and exiled Orbiana in 227 after her father Seius Sallustius was executed after being accused of treason.65 According to Historia Augusta a late Roman work containing biographies of emperors and others and considered by scholars to be a work of dubious historical reliability66 Alexander was also at some point married to Sulpicia Memmia a member of one of the most ancient Patrician families in Rome and a daughter to a man of consular rank her grandfathers name was Catulus. She is mentioned as his wife only in this later text thus the marriage has been questioned.6768 The ancient historian Zosimus claimed that Alexander was married three times.69 A man named Varius Macrinus may have been Alexanders fatherinlaw but it is uncertain if he was the same man as Seius Sallustius the father of Memmia or the father of an entirely unknown third wife.70 Alexander is not known to have fathered any children.71 Christianityedit The Historia Augusta claims that Alexander prayed every morning in his private chapel. He was extremely tolerant of Jews and Christians alike. He continued all privileges towards Jews during his reign2672 and the Augustan History relates that Alexander placed images of Abraham and Jesus in his oratory along with other Roman deities and classical figures.7374 Severan dynasty family treeedit v t e Severan family tree Septimius Macer Gaius Claudius Septimius Aper Fulvius Pius Lucius Septimius Severus Publius Septimius Aper Gaius Septimius Aper Fulvia Pia Publius Septimius Geta Septimia Polla Julius Bassianus Septimius Publius Septimius Geta Septimia Octavilla Paccia Marciana 1 Septimius Severus r.1932
