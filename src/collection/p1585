3 rd session Reference no. 87 Region Arab States Thebes Arabic  Ancient Greek  Thbai known to the ancient Egyptians as Waset Arabic 1 was an ancient Egyptian city located along the Nile about 800 kilometers 500 mi south of the Mediterranean. Its ruins lie within the modern Egyptian city of Luxor. Thebes was the main city of the fourth Upper Egyptian nome Sceptre nome and was the capital of Egypt for long periods during the Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom eras. It was close to Nubia and the Eastern Desert with its valuable mineral resources and trade routes. It was a religious center and the most venerated city during many periods of ancient Egyptian history. The site of Thebes includes areas on both the eastern bank of the Nile where the temples of Karnak and Luxor stand and where the city was situated and the western bank where a necropolis of large private and royal cemeteries and funerary complexes can be found. In 1979 the ruins of ancient Thebes were classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.2 Toponymyedit ws.t City of the Scepter in hieroglyphs niw.t rs.t Southern City3 in hieroglyphs iwnwsm Heliopolis of the South4 in hieroglyphs The Egyptian name for Thebes was ws.t City of the ws the sceptre of the pharaohs a long staff with an animals head and a forked base. From the end of the New Kingdom Thebes was known in Egyptian as njw.tjmn the City of Amun the chief of the Theban Triad of deities whose other members were Mut and Khonsu. This name of Thebes appears in the Tanakh as the N mn   in the Book of Nahum5 and also as No  mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel6 and Jeremiah.78 Thebes is sometimes claimed to be the Latinised form of Ancient Greek  the hellenized form of Demotic Egyptian t jpt the temple referring to jptswt the temple is now known by its Arabic name Karnak fortified village on the northeast bank of the city. Since Homer refers to the metropolis by this name and since Demotic script did not appear until a later date the etymology is doubtful. As early as Homers Iliad9 the Greeks distinguished the Egyptian Thebes as Thebes of the Hundred Gates   Thbai hekatmpyloi or HundredGated Thebes as opposed to the Thebes of the Seven Gates   Thbai heptpyloi in Boeotia Greece.n 1 In the interpretatio graeca Amun was rendered as Zeus Ammon. The name was therefore translated into Greek as Diospolis City of Zeus. To distinguish it from the numerous other cities by this name it was known as the Great Diospolis   Diospolis Megl Latin Diospolis Magna. The Greek names came into wider use after the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great when the country came to be ruled by the Macedonian Ptolemaic dynasty. Characteristicsedit Geographyedit Thebes was located along the banks of the Nile River in the middle part of Upper Egypt about 800 km south of the Delta. It was built largely on the alluvial plains of the Nile Valley which follows a great bend of the Nile. As a natural consequence the city was laid in a northeastsouthwest axis parallel to the contemporary river channel. Thebes had an area of 93 km2 36 sq mi which included parts of the Theban Hills in the west that culminates at the sacred 4

78 foot alQurn. In the east lies the mountainous Eastern Desert with its wadis draining into the valley. Significant among these wadis is Wadi Hammamat near Thebes. It was used as an overland trade route going to the Red Sea coast. Wadi Hammamat was the primary trade route linking Egypt to the Red Sea since PreDynastic times.11 Uruk civilization was transmitted to Egypt along this corridor. It is the likely that Thinis the capital of the First Dynasty was located in the same region as Thebes for this reason. Both cities were at a crossroad region in Upper Egypt between the Nile in the north to south direction and Saharan caravan routes connecting to Red Sea maritime routes via Wadi Hammamat in the East West direction. The Wadi elHol is also located near Thebes this valley connected Thebes to an oasis on the Western Desert. It is notable for the first ProtoSinatic alphabet inscription which appeared shortly after Thebes became the capital of Egypt. Nearby towns in the fourth Upper Egyptian nome were PerHathor Madu Djerty Iuny Sumenu and Imiotru.
12 page needed Demographicsedit Population of Thebes 2000900 BC According to George Modelski Thebes had about 40000 inhabitants in 2000 BC compared to 60000 in Memphis the largest city in the world at the time. By 1800 BC the population of Memphis was down to about 30000 making Thebes the largest city in Egypt at the time.13 Historian Ian Morris has estimated that by 1500 BC Thebes may have grown to be the largest city in the world with a population of about 75000 a position it held until about 900 BC when it was surpassed by Nimrud among others.14 A 2005 study on Theban nobles had found that the mummified remains had a histology which indicated notably dark skin.15 Economyedit The archaeological remains of Thebes offer a striking testimony to Egyptian civilization at its height. The Greek poet Homer extolled the wealth of Thebes in the Iliad Book 9 c.
8 th Century BC ... in Egyptian Thebes the heaps of precious ingots gleam the hundredgated Thebes.1617 Cultureedit More than sixty annual festivals were celebrated in Thebes. The major festivals among these according to the Edfu Geographical Text were the Beautiful Feast of Opet the Khoiak Festival Festival of I Shemu and Festival of II Shemu. Another popular festivity was the halloweenlike Beautiful Festival of the Valley.18 Historyedit Old Kingdomedit The Theban Necropolis Thebes was inhabited from around 3200 BC.19 It was the eponymous capital of Waset the fourth Upper Egyptian nome. At this time it was still a small trading post while Memphis served as the royal residence of the Old Kingdom pharaohs. Although no buildings survive in Thebes older than portions of the Karnak temple complex that may date from the Middle Kingdom the lower part of a statue of Pharaoh Nyuserre of the 
5 th Dynasty has been found in Karnak. Another statue dedicated by the 
12 th Dynasty king Senusret may have been usurped and reused since the statue bears a cartouche of Nyuserre on its belt. Since seven rulers of the 
4 th to 
6 th Dynasties appear on the Karnak king list perhaps at the least there was a temple in the Theban area that dated to the Old Kingdom. First Intermediate Periodedit By 2160 BC a new line of pharaohs the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties consolidated control over Lower Egypt and northern parts of Upper Egypt from their capital in Herakleopolis Magna. A rival line the Eleventh Dynasty based at Thebes ruled the remaining part of Upper Egypt. The Theban rulers were apparently descendants of the prince of Thebes Intef the Elder. His probable grandson Intef I was the first of the family to claim in life a partial pharaonic titulary though his power did not extend much further than the general Theban region. Middle Kingdomedit Serekh of Intef I inscribed posthumously for him by Mentuhotep II Finally by c.2050 BC Intef IIIs son Mentuhotep II meaning Montu is satisfied took the Herakleopolitans by force and reunited Egypt once again under one ruler thereby starting the period now known as the Middle Kingdom. Mentuhotep II ruled for 51 years and built the first mortuary temple at Deir elBahri which most likely served as the inspiration for the later and larger temple built next to it by Hatshepsut in the 
18 th Dynasty. After these events the 
11 th Dynasty was shortlived as less than twenty years had elapsed between the death of Mentuhotep II and that of Mentuhotep IV in mysterious circumstances. During the 
12 th Dynasty Amenemhat I moved the seat of power North to Itjtawy. Thebes continued to thrive as a religious center as the local god Amun was becoming increasingly prominent throughout Egypt. The oldest remains of a temple dedicated to Amun date to the reign of Senusret I.citation needed Thebes was already in the Middle Kingdom a town of considerable size. Excavations around the Karnak temple show that the Middle Kingdom town had a layout with a grid pattern. The city was at least one kilometre long and 50 hectares in area. Remains of two palatial buildings were also detected.20 Starting in the later part of the 
12 th Dynasty a group of Canaanite people began settling in the eastern Nile Delta. They eventually founded the 
14 th Dynasty at Avaris in c.1805 BC or c.1710 BC. By doing so the Asiatics established hegemony over the majority of the Delta region subtracting these territories from the influence of the 
13 th Dynasty that had meanwhile succeeded the 
12 th.21 Second Intermediate Periodedit Depiction of Asiatic left and Egyptian people right. The Asiatic leader is labeled as Ruler of foreign lands Ibsha. A second wave of Asiatics called Hyksos from Heqakhasut rulers of foreign lands as Egyptians called their leaders immigrated into Egypt and overran the Canaanite center of power at Avaris starting the 
15 th Dynasty there. The Hyksos kings gained the upper hand over Lower Egypt early into the Second Intermediate Period 16571549 BC.22 When the Hyksos took Memphis during or shortly after Merneferre Ays reign c.1700 BC the rulers of the 
13 th Dynasty fled south to Thebes which was restored as capital.23 Theban princes now known as the 
16 th Dynasty stood firmly over their immediate region as the Hyksos advanced from the Delta southwards to Middle Egypt. The Thebans resisted the Hyksos further advance by making an agreement for a peaceful concurrent rule between them. The Hyksos were able to sail upstream past Thebes to trade with the Nubians and the Thebans brought their herds to the Delta without adversaries. The status quo continued until Hyksos ruler Apophis 
15 th Dynasty insulted Seqenenre Tao 
17 th Dynasty of Thebes. Soon the armies of Thebes marched on the Hyksosruled lands. Tao died in battle and his son Kamose took charge of the campaign. After Kamoses death his brother Ahmose I continued until he captured Avaris the Hyksos capital. Ahmose I drove the Hyksos out of Egypt and the Levant and reclaimed the lands formerly ruled by them.24 New Kingdom and the height of Thebesedit Statues of Memnon at Thebes during the flood after David Roberts c.1845 Ahmose I founded a new age for a unified Egypt with Thebes as its capital. The city remained as capital during most of the 
18 th Dynasty New Kingdom. It also became the center for a newly established professional civil service where there was a greater demand for scribes and the literate as the royal archives began to fill with accounts and reports.25 At the city the favored few of Nubia were reeducated with Egyptian culture to serve as administrators of the colony.26 Overhead illustration of the Karnak temple With Egypt stabilized again religion and religious centers flourished and none more so than Thebes. For instance Amenhotep III poured much of his vast wealth from foreign tribute into the temples of Amun.27 The Theban god Amun became a principal state deity and every building project sought to outdo the last in proclaiming the glory of Amun and the pharaohs themselves.28 Thutmose I reigned 15061493 BC began the first great expansion of the Karnak temple. After this colossal enlargements of the temple became the norm throughout the New Kingdom. Queen Hatshepsut reigned 14791458 BC helped the Theban economy flourish by renewing trade networks primarily the Red Sea trade between Thebes Red Sea port of AlQusayr Elat and the land of Punt. Her successor Thutmose III brought to Thebes a great deal of his war booty that originated from as far away as Mittani. The 
18 th Dynasty reached its peak during his greatgrandson Amenhotep IIIs reign 13881350 BC. Aside from embellishing the temples of Amun Amenhotep increased construction in Thebes to unprecedented levels. On the west bank he built the enormous mortuary temple and the equally massive Malkata palacecity which fronted a 3
64 hectare artificial lake. In the city proper he built the Luxor temple and the Avenue of the Sphinxes leading to Karnak. For a brief period in the reign of Amenhotep IIIs son Akhenaten 13511334 BC Thebes fell on hard times the city was abandoned by the court and the worship of Amun was proscribed. The capital was moved to the new city of Akhetaten Amarna in modern Egypt midway between Thebes and Memphis. After his death his son Tutankhamun returned the capital to Memphis29 but renewed building projects at Thebes produced even more glorious temples and shrines.27 The Ramesseum at Thebes by John Frederick Lewis c.1845 Yale Center for British Art New Haven With the 
19 th Dynasty the seat of government moved to the Delta. Thebes maintained its revenues and prestige through the reigns of Seti I 12901279 BC and Ramesses II 12791213 BC who still resided for part of every year in Thebes.27 Ramesses II carried out extensive building projects in the city such as statues and obelisks the third enclosure wall of Karnak temple additions to the Luxor temple and the Ramesseum his grand mortuary temple. The constructions were bankrolled by the large granaries built around the Ramesseum that concentrated the taxes collected from Upper Egypt

66 year reign Egypt and Thebes reached an overwhelming state of prosperity that equaled or even surpassed the earlier peak under Amenhotep III.31 Polychromed column with basreliefs at the temple of Medinet Habu dedicated to Rameses III The city continued to be well kept in the early 
20 th Dynasty. The Great Harris Papyrus states that Ramesses III reigned 118756 donated 86486 slaves and vast estates to the temples of Amun. Ramesses III received tributes from all subject peoples including the Sea Peoples and Meshwesh Libyans. The whole of Egypt was experiencing financial problems however exemplified in the events at Thebes village of Deir elMedina. In the 
25 th year of his reign workers in Deir elMedina began striking for pay and there arose a general unrest of all social classes. Subsequently an unsuccessful Harem conspiracy led to the executions of many conspirators including Theban officials and women.32 Under the later Ramessids Thebes began to decline as the government fell into grave economic difficulties. During the reign of Ramesses IX 11291111 BC about 1114 BC a series of investigations into the plundering of royal tombs in the necropolis of western Thebes uncovered proof of corruption in high places following an accusation made by the mayor of the east bank against his colleague on the west. The plundered royal mummies were moved from place to place and at last deposited by the priests of Amun in a tombshaft in Deir elBahri and in the tomb of Amenhotep II. The finding of these two hiding places in 1881 and 1898 respectively was one of the great events of modern archaeological discovery. Such maladministration in Thebes led to unrest.27 Third Intermediate Periodedit Control of local affairs tended to come more and more into the hands of the High Priests of Amun so that during the Third Intermediate Period the High Priest of Amun exerted absolute power over the South a counterbalance to the 
21 st and 
22 nd Dynasty kings who ruled from the Delta. Intermarriage and adoption strengthened the ties between them daughters of the Tanite kings being installed as Gods Wife of Amun at Thebes where they wielded greater power. Theban political influence receded only in the Late Period.33 By around 750 BC the Kushites Nubians were growing their influence over Thebes and Upper Egypt. In 721 BC King Shabaka of the Kushites defeated the combined forces of Osorkon IV

24 th Dynasty and reunified Egypt yet again. His reign saw a significant amount of building work undertaken throughout Egypt especially at the city of Thebes which he made the capital of his kingdom. In Karnak he erected a pink granite statue of himself wearing the Pschent the double crown of Egypt. Taharqa accomplished many notable projects at Thebes i.e. the Kiosk in Karnak and Nubia before the Assyrians started to wage war against Egypt. Late Periodedit A column of Taharqa at the precinct of AmunRe at Karnak Temple restored to full height In 667 BC attacked by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipals army Taharqa abandoned Lower Egypt and fled to Thebes. After his death three years later his nephew or cousin Tantamani seized Thebes invaded Lower Egypt and laid siege to Memphis but abandoned his attempts to conquer the country in 663 BC and retreated southwards.34 The Assyrians pursued him and took Thebes whose name was added to a long list of cities plundered and destroyed by the Assyrians as Ashurbanipal wrote This city the whole of it I conquered it with the help of Ashur and Ishtar. Silver gold precious stones all the wealth of the palace rich cloth precious linen great horses supervising men and women two obelisks of splendid electrum weighing 2500 talents the doors of temples I tore from their bases and carried them off to Assyria. With this weighty booty I left Thebes. Against Egypt and Kush I have lifted my spear and shown my power. With full hands I have returned to Nineveh in good health.35 Thebes never regained its former political significance but it remained an important religious centre. Assyrians installed Psamtik I 664610 BC who ascended to Thebes in 656 BC and brought about the adoption of his own daughter Nitocris I as heiress to Gods Wife of Amun there. In 525 BC Persian Cambyses II invaded Egypt and became pharaoh subordinating the kingdom as a satrapy to the greater Achaemenid Empire.36 GraecoRoman Periodedit Relief in Hathor temple Deir elMedina built during the Ptolemaic Dynasty The good relationship of the Thebans with the central power in the North ended when the native Egyptian pharaohs were finally replaced by Greeks led by Alexander the Great. He visited Thebes during a celebration of the Opet Festival. In spite of his welcoming visit Thebes became a center for dissent. Towards the end of the third century BC Hugronaphor Horwennefer possibly of Nubian origin led a revolt against the Ptolemies in Upper Egypt. His successor Ankhmakis held large parts of Upper Egypt until 185 BC. This revolt was supported by the Theban priesthood. After the suppression of the revolt in 185 BC Ptolemy V in need of the support of the priesthood pardoned them. Half a century later the Thebans rose again elevating a certain Harsiesi to the throne in 132 BC. Harsiesi having helped himself to the funds of the royal bank at Thebes fled the following year. In 91 BC another revolt broke out. In the following years Thebes was subdued and the city turned into rubble.37 During the Roman occupation 30 BC641 AD the remaining communities clustered around the pylon of the Luxor temple. Thebes became part of the Roman province of Thebais which later split into Thebais Superior centered at the city and Thebais Inferior centered at Ptolemais Hermiou. A Roman legion was headquartered in Luxor temple at the time of Roman campaigns in Nubia.38 Building did not come to an abrupt stop but the city continued to decline. In the first century AD Strabo described Thebes as having been relegated to a mere village.27 Major sitesedit Eastern Thebes The main entrance to Karnak flanked by ramheaded sphinxes Obelisk Ramesside colossi and great pylon of Luxor Temple with subtle orange glow Ancient builtup area Great Temple of Amun at Karnak Ancient Egyptian Taopet. Still the second largest religious building ever built it is the main house of worship for Amun Thebes patron deity and the residence of the powerful Amun priesthood. What differentiated it from the many temples of Egypt is the length of time it was built over more than 2000 years starting in the Middle Kingdom. The main features of this temple are its ten large pylons the Great Hypostyle Hall a sacred lake subtemples numerous shrines and multiple obelisks. It was the most important temple for a majority of Ancient Egyptian history. Luxor Temple Ipet resyt. Unlike the other temples in Thebes it is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified version of the king in death. Instead it is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship it may have been where many of the pharaohs of Egypt were crowned. It is a centerpiece of the Opet Festival where the sacred barque of the Theban Triad travels from Karnak to Luxor temple highlighting the godly significance of the pharaohs recoronation .

From 25 October 2018 to 27 January 2019 the Museum of Grenoble organized with the support of the Louvre and the British Museum a threemonth exhibition on the city of Thebes and the role of women in the city at that time.39 In popular cultureedit In popular culture Thebes is a setting in the films The Mummy 1999 and The Mummy Returns 2001. It is said to be the Land of the Living. In real history there was no such name given to it. The films feature scenes taking place in ancient Egypt in its prime which affect the story in the modern setting some 3000 years later. In The Egyptian by the author Mika Waltari there are ellaborate descriptions on how Thebes looked during the 
18 th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt.
