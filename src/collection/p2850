18 th Dynasty Amenhotep I mnhotp5 or Amenophis I mnofs6 from Ancient Greek 7 was the second Pharaoh of the 
18 th Dynasty of Egypt. His reign is generally dated from 1526 to 1506 BC. He was a son of Ahmose I and AhmoseNefertari but had an elder brother Ahmoseankh and was not expected to inherit the throne. However sometime in the eight years between Ahmose Is 
17 th regnal year and his death his heir apparent died and Amenhotep became crown prince.7 He then acceded to the throne and ruled for about 21 years.2 Although his reign is poorly documented it is possible to piece together a basic history from available evidence. He inherited the kingdom formed by his fathers military conquests and maintained dominance over Nubia and the Nile Delta but probably did not attempt to maintain Egyptian power in the Levant. He continued the rebuilding of temples in Upper Egypt and revolutionized mortuary complex design by separating his tomb from his mortuary temple setting a trend in royal funerary monuments which would persist throughout the New Kingdom. After his death he was deified as a patron god of Deir elMedina.8 Osiride statue of Amenhotep I now in the British Museum. Familyedit See also Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt family tree Amenhotep I was the son of Ahmose I and AhmoseNefertari. His elder brother the crown prince Ahmoseankh died before him thus clearing the way for his ascension to the throne.7 Amenhotep probably came to power while he was still young himself and his mother AhmoseNefertari appears to have been regent for him for at least a short time.9 The evidence for this regency is that both he and his mother are credited with founding a settlement for workers in the Theban Necropolis at Deir elMedina.9 Amenhotep took his older sister AhmoseMeritamon as his Great Royal Wife.10 Another wifes name Sitkamose is attested on a nineteenth dynasty stele.11 Beyond this the relationships between Amenhotep I and other possible family members are unclear. Ahhotep II is usually called his wife and sister12 despite an alternative theory that she was his grandmother.11 He is thought to have had one son by Ahhotep II Amenemhat who died while still very young.12 This remains the consensus although there are arguments against that relationship as well.11 With no living heirs Amenhotep was succeeded by Thutmose I who he married to his sister Ahmose.12 Since Ahmose is never given the title Kings Daughter in any inscription some scholars doubt whether she was a sibling of Amenhotep I.11 Dates and length of reignedit Representation of Amenhotep I from Tomb TT359 at Deir elMedina Egypt. Neues Museum Berlin In Amenhotep Is ninth regnal year a heliacal rise of Sothis was observed on the ninth day of the third month of summer.13 Modern astronomers have calculated that if the observation was made from Memphis or Heliopolis such an observation could only have been made on that day in 1537 BC. If the observation was made in Thebes however it could only have taken place in 1517 BC.14 The latter choice is usually accepted as correct since Thebes was the capital during the early 
18 th dynasty hence Amenhotep I is usually given an accession date in 1526 BC13 although the possibility of 1546 BC is not entirely dismissed. Manethos Epitome states that Amenhotep I ruled Egypt for twenty years and seven months or twentyone years depending on the source.15 While Amenhotep Is highest attested regnal year is only his Year 10 Manethos statement is confirmed by a passage in the tomb autobiography of a magician named Amenemhet. This explicitly states that he served under Amenhotep I for 21 years.16 Thus in the high chronology Amenhotep I is given a reign from around 1546 to 1526 BC and in the low chronology from around 1526 to 1506 BC or 1525 to 1504 BC17 though individual scholars may ascribe dates to his reign that vary from these by a few years. Foreign policyedit Relief of Amenhotep I from Karnak. Amenhotep Is Horus and Two Ladies names Bull who conquers the lands and He who inspires great terror are generally interpreted to mean that Amenhotep I intended to dominate the surrounding nations.13 Two tomb texts indicate that he led campaigns into Nubia. According to the tomb texts of Ahmose son of Ebana Amenhotep later sought to expand Egypts border southward into Nubia and he led an invasion force which defeated the Nubian army.18 The tomb biography of Ahmose PenNekhebet says he also fought in a campaign in Kush19 however it is quite possible that it refers to the same campaign as Ahmose son of Ebana.13 Amenhotep built a temple at Sa showing that he had established Egyptian settlements almost as far as the Third Cataract.9 Head from a statue of Amenhotep I now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art New York A single reference in the tomb of Ahmose PenNekhebet indicates another campaign in Iamu in the land of Kehek.20 Unfortunately the location of Kehek is unknown. It was long believed that Kehek was a reference to the Libyan tribe Qeheq and thus it was postulated that invaders from Libya took advantage of the death of Ahmose to move into the western Nile Delta.21 Unfortunately for this theory the Qeheq people only appeared in later times and Keheks identity remains unknown. Nubia is a possibility since Amenhotep did campaign there and the western desert and the oases have also been suggested since these seem to have fallen under Egyptian control once again.20 Egypt had lost the western desert and the oases during the Second Intermediate Period and during the revolt against the Hyksos Kamose thought it necessary to garrison them.22 It is uncertain when they were fully retaken but on one stele the title PrinceGovernor of the oases was used23 which means that Amenhoteps reign forms the terminus ante quem for the return of Egyptian rule.22 There are no recorded campaigns in SyroPalestine during Amenhotep Is reign. However according to the Tombos Stela of his successor Thutmose I when Thutmose led a campaign into Asia all the way to the Euphrates he found no one who fought against him.24 If Thutmose did not lead a campaign which has not been recorded into Asia before this recorded one it would mean that the preceding pharaoh would have had to pacify Syria instead25 which would indicate a possible Asiatic campaign of Amenhotep I. Two references to the Levant potentially written during his reign might be contemporary witnesses to such a campaign. One of the candidates for Amenhoteps tomb contains a reference to Qedmi which is somewhere in Canaan or the Transjordan and Amenemhets tomb contains a hostile reference to Mitanni.26 However neither of these references necessarily refer to campaigning nor do they even necessarily date to Amenhoteps reign. The location of Amenhoteps tomb is not certain and Amenemhet lived to serve under multiple kings who are known to have attacked Mitanni.26 Records from Amenhoteps reign are simply altogether too scant and too vague to reach a conclusion about any Syrian campaign. Cultural and intellectual developmentsedit Modern drawing of a doorway from TT359 showing Amenhotep I with his mother AhmoseNefertari Large numbers of statues of Amenhotep have been found but they are mostly from the Ramesside period and relate to his continuing funerary cult11 made for his posthumous funerary cult.23 This makes study of the art of his reign difficult.23 Based upon his few authentic statues it appears that Amenhotep continued the practice of copying Middle Kingdom styles.27 Art in the early 
18 th dynasty was particularly similar to that of the early Middle Kingdom28 and the statues produced by Amenhotep I clearly copied those of Mentuhotep II and Senusret I.29 The two types are so similar that modern Egyptologists have had trouble telling the two apart.27 It was probably Amenhotep I who founded the artisans village at Deir elMedina whose inhabitants were responsible for much of the art which filled the tombs in the Theban Necropolis for the following generations of New Kingdom rulers and nobles.11 The earliest name found there is that of Thutmose I however Amenhotep was clearly an important figure to the citys workmen since he and his mother were both its patron deities.30 Amenhoteps reign saw literary developments. The Book of What is in the Underworld the Egyptian Book of the Dead an important funerary text used in the New Kingdom is believed to have reached its final form during Amenhoteps reign since it first appears in the decoration of the tomb of his successor Thutmose I.31 The Ebers papyrus which is the main source for information on ancient Egyptian medicine also seems to date to this time the mention of the Heliacal rise of Sothis by which the early New Kingdom chronology is usually calculated was found on the back of this document.31 It appears that during Amenhotep Is reign the first water clock was invented.32 Amenhoteps court astronomer Amenemheb took credit for creating this device in his tomb biography although the oldest surviving mechanism dates to the reign of Amenhotep III.33 This invention was of great benefit for timekeeping because the Egyptian hour was not a fixed amount of time but was measured as 112 of the night.33 When the nights were shorter in the summer these waterclocks could be adjusted to measure the shorter hours accurately.33 Building projectsedit Amenhotep Is reconstructed alabaster chapel at Karnak Amenhotep began or continued a number of building projects at temple sites in Upper Egypt but most of the structures he built were later dismantled or obliterated by his successors. From written sources it is known that he commissioned the architect Ineni to expand the Temple of Karnak.34 Inenis tomb biography indicates that he created a 
20 cubit gate of limestone on the south side of Karnak.35 He constructed a sacred barque chapel of Amun out of alabaster and a copy of the White Chapel of Senusret III. Sculpted material from these structures has been recovered from the fill of Amenhotep IIIs third pylon allowing some of these structures to be rebuilt at Karnak.23 Amenhotep also built structures at Karnak for his Sed festival a festival by which a pharaohs strength and vigour was renewed after reigning 30 years but it seems likely that he died before he could use them.36 A temple was constructed in Nubia at Sa9 and he built temple structures in Upper Egypt at Elephantine Kom Ombo Abydos and the Temple of Nekhbet. As far as is known Amenhotep did not build anything of significance in Lower Egypt like his father.31 Mortuary complexedit Amenhotep I was the first king of Egypt to separate his mortuary temple from his tomb probably in an attempt to keep his tomb safe from robbers. This temple was sited at the north end of Deir elBahri.37 Deir elBahri appears to have had some sort of funerary significance for Amenhotep since Theban Tomb 358 the tomb of his queen AhmoseMeritamon was also found nearby.38 Amenhoteps mortuary temple was largely demolished to make way for the lower terrace of the mortuary temple constructed approximately 50 years later by Queen Hatshepsut39 and only a few bricks inscribed with Amenhoteps name remain.37 The royal statues inside of the temple were moved to the nearby funerary temple of Mentuhotep II.38 Tomb and burialedit The original location of Amenhoteps tomb has not been securely identified. A report on the security of royal tombs in the Theban Necropolis commissioned during the troubled reign of Ramesses IX noted that it was then intact but its location was not specified.9 Two sites for Amenhotep Is tomb have been proposed one high up in the Valley of the Kings KV39 and the other at Dra Abu elNaga Tomb ANB.13 Excavations at KV 39 suggest it was used or reused to store the Deir elBahri Cache which included the kings wellpreserved mummy before its final reburial.40 However Tomb ANB is considered the more likely possibility931 because it contains objects bearing his name and the names of some family members.41 Mummyedit The mummy of Amenhotep I Sometime during the 
20 th or 
21 st Dynasty Amenhoteps original tomb was either robbed or deemed insecure and emptied and his body was moved for safety probably more than once. It was found in the Deir elBahri Cache hidden with the mummies of numerous New Kingdom kings and nobles in or after the late 
22 nd dynasty above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut9 and was kept in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. His mummy had apparently not been looted by the 
21 st dynasty and the priests who moved the mummy took care to keep the cartonnage facemask intact. Amenhoteps is the only royal mummy which has not been unwrapped and examined by modern Egyptologists.9 His body was xrayed in 1932 his age at death was estimated at 4050 years. He was xrayed again in 1967 resulting in a much lower age estimate of 25 years at death based on the good condition of his teeth. In April 2021 his mummy was moved to National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs Golden Parade.42 Threedimensional CT image of the face and left profile of Amenhotep I CT scanedit The Xray examinations of the mummy of King Amenhotep I failed to provide consistent data or detailed information on the mummy. In the plain xray examination the threedimensional 
3 D information of the mummy is projected onto a twodimensional Xray film. The result is the superimposition of objects and bones which makes mummy characterization less satisfactory.43 In contrast CT is an advanced form of Xray that obtains hundreds of thin sections slices of the body and provides more detailed reconstructed images of soft tissues as well as bones. On 4 May 2019 his mummy was investigated using noninvasive CT scanning to gain insights into his physical appearance health cause of death and mummification style. Twodimensional and threedimensional images of the mask bandages and mummy were generated using this technique. This study estimates his age at death as 35 years based on the fusion of his epiphyses and condition of the pubic symphysis. His organs were removed through a vertical embalming incision and the body cavity stuffed with linen the heart is present in the chest cavity. No attempt was made to remove the brain. No packing was inserted into the orbits and no subcutaneous padding is seen anywhere on the body. Each nostril was plugged with rolls of resintreated linen. Amulets and items of jewelry are present inside the wrappings a beaded girdle likely of gold is present at across the back of his hips. The body had suffered postmortem damage at the hands of robbers with his head left arm right hand and right foot being detached there is also a large hole in the front of his torso. Efforts were made to restore the body during his rewrapping and caching. His head and limbs were reattached and his foot was supported by a board.43 Succession and legacyedit Head from a statue of Amenhotep I Museum of Fine Arts Boston Amenhotep I is thought to have had only one child a son who died in infancy although some sources indicate he had no children.10 Amenhotep I was succeeded by Thutmose I apparently a senior military figure. It is unclear if there was any blood relationship between the two although it has been suggested that Thutmose I was a son of Amenhotep Is probable uncle Ahmose Sipairi.44 Amenhotep may have appointed Thutmose I as coregent before his own death as Thutmose Is name appears next to Amenhoteps on a divine barque found by archeologists in the fill of the third pylon at Karnak.23 However most scholars consider that this is only evidence of Thutmose associating himself with his royal predecessor.11 One text has also been interpreted to mean that Amenhotep appointed his infant son as coregent who then predeceased him.36 However the scholarly consensus is that there is too little evidence for either coregency. Funerary cultedit An image of Amenhotep I from his funerary cult Amenhotep was deified upon his death and made the patron deity of the village which he opened at Deir elMedina.11 His mother who lived at least one year longer than he did was also deified upon her death and became part of his litany.45 As previously mentioned the vast majority of Amenhoteps statuary comes in the form of a funerary idol from this cult during later periods. When being worshiped he had three deific manifestations Amenhotep of the Town Amenhotep Beloved of Amun and Amenhotep of the Forecourt and was known as a god who produced oracles.11 Some of the questions asked of him have been preserved on ostraca from Deir elMedina and appear to have been phrased in such a way that the idol of the king could nod or be caused to nod the answer.46 He also had a number of feasts dedicated to him which were held throughout the year.11 During the first month a festival was celebrated in honor of the appearance of Amenhotep to the necropolis workmen which probably means his idol was taken to Deir elMedina.47 Another feast was held on the thirtieth of the fourth month and then two more were held in the seventh month.47 The first was the spreading of the funeral couch for king Amenhotep which probably commemorated the day of his death.47 The second celebrated for four days at the very end of the month was the great festival of king Amenhotep lord of the town. Later in Egyptian history the seventh month Phamenoth was named after this festival.47 Another festival was held on the 
27 th of the ninth month and the last known festival was held for several days between at least the eleventh and thirteenth days of the eleventh month which in all probability commemorated the date of Amenhoteps accession to the throne.47 Further light is shed upon Amenhoteps funerary cult by multiple documents which appear to detail the rituals dedicated to Amenhotep.48 Three papyri from the time of Ramesses II record the liturgy used by the priests and reliefs at Karnak and Medinet Habu illustrate select rites and spells.48 The bulk of the rituals concern preparing for and conducting the daily offerings of libations for the idol including a recitation of a tpdnsw formula and purifying and sealing the shrine at the end of the day.49 The remainder of the rites concern how to conduct various feasts throughout the year.50 In these cases Amenhoteps idol or a priest representing him is actually officiating the worship of Amun instead of being worshipped himself which was not a typical cultic practice in ancient Egypt.51 See alsoedit List of pharaohs Citationsedit  Maspero 1910 p. 8.  a b Manetho  translated by W.G.
