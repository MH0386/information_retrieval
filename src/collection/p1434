32.6 01417 Location East Valley of the Kings Discovered 4 November 1922 101 years ago 4 November 1922 Excavated by Howard Carter Decoration Opening of the Mouth Book of the Amduat Layout Bent to the right  Previous KV61 Next  KV63 The tomb of Tutankhamun also known by its tomb number KV62 is the burial place of Tutankhamun reigned c. 13321323 BC a pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of ancient Egypt in the Valley of the Kings. The tomb consists of four chambers and an entrance staircase and corridor. It is smaller and less extensively decorated than other Egyptian royal tombs of its time and it probably originated as a tomb for a nonroyal individual that was adapted for Tutankhamuns use after his premature death. Like other pharaohs Tutankhamun was buried with a wide variety of funerary objects and personal possessions such as coffins furniture clothing and jewelry though in the unusually limited space these goods had to be densely packed. Robbers entered the tomb twice in the years immediately following the burial but Tutankhamuns mummy and most of the burial goods remained intact. The tombs low position dug into the floor of the valley allowed its entrance to be hidden by debris deposited by flooding and tomb construction. Thus unlike other tombs in the valley it was not stripped of its valuables during the Third Intermediate Period c. 1070664 BC. Tutankhamuns tomb was discovered in 1922 by excavators led by Howard Carter. As a result of the quantity and spectacular appearance of the burial goods the tomb attracted a media frenzy and became the most famous find in the history of Egyptology. The death of Carters patron the Earl of Carnarvon in the midst of the excavation process inspired speculation that the tomb was cursed. The discovery produced only limited evidence about the history of Tutankhamuns reign and the Amarna Period that preceded it but it provided insight into the material culture of wealthy ancient Egyptians as well as patterns of ancient tomb robbery. Tutankhamun became one of the bestknown pharaohs and some artefacts from his tomb such as his golden funerary mask are among the bestknown artworks from ancient Egypt. Most of the tombs goods were sent to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and are now in the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza although Tutankhamuns mummy and sarcophagus are still on display in the tomb. Flooding and heavy tourist traffic have inflicted damage on the tomb since its discovery and a replica of the burial chamber has been constructed nearby to reduce tourist pressure on the original tomb. Historyedit Burial and robberiesedit The central portion of the Valley of the Kings in 2012 with tomb entrances labeled. The covered entrance to KV62 is at centre right. Tutankhamun reigned as pharaoh between c. 1334 and 1325 BC towards the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty during the New Kingdom.12 He took the throne as a child after the death of Akhenaten who was probably his father and the subsequent brief reigns of Neferneferuaten and Smenkhkare. Akhenaten had radically reshaped ancient Egyptian religion by worshipping a single deity Aten and rejecting other deities a shift that began the Amarna Period.3 One of Tutankhamuns major acts was the restoration of traditional religious practice. His name was changed from Tutankhaten referring to Akhenatens deity to Tutankhamun honouring Amun one of the foremost deities of the traditional pantheon. Similarly his queens name was changed from Ankhesenpaaten to Ankhesenamun.4 Shortly after Tutankhamun took power he commissioned a fullsize royal tomb in the Valley of the Kings which was probably one of two tombs from the same era WV23 or KV
57.5  KV62 is thought to have originally been a nonroyal tomb possibly intended for Ay Tutankhamuns advisor. After he died prematurely KV62 was enlarged to accommodate his burial. Ay became pharaoh on Tutankhamuns death and was buried in WV23. Ay was elderly when he came to the throne and it is possible that he buried Tutankhamun in KV62 in order to usurp WV23 for himself and ensure that he would have a tomb of suitably royal proportions ready when he himself died. Pharaohs in Tutankhamuns time also built mortuary temples where they would receive offerings to sustain their spirits in the afterlife. The Temple of Ay and Horemheb at Medinet Habu contained statues that were originally carved for Tutankhamun suggesting either that Tutankhamuns temple stood nearby or that Ay usurped Tutankhamuns temple as his own.6 Ay was succeeded by Tutankhamuns general Horemheb although the transfer of power may have been contested and created a brief period of political instability.78 As part of the continued reaction against Atenism Horemheb tried to erase Akhenaten and his successors from the record dismantling Akhenatens monuments and usurping those erected by Tutankhamun. Future kinglists skipped straight from Akhenatens father Amenhotep III to Horemheb.7 Within a few years of Tutankhamuns burial his tomb was robbed twice. After the first robbery officials responsible for its security repaired and repacked some of the damaged goods before filling the outer corridor with chips of limestone along with objects dropped by the thieves to deter future thefts. Nevertheless a second set of robbers burrowed through the corridor fill. This robbery too was detected and after a second hasty restoration the tomb was once again sealed.9 The Valley of the Kings is subject to periodic flash floods that deposit alluvium.10 Much of the valley including the entrance to Tutankhamuns tomb was covered by a layer of alluvium over which huts were later built for the tomb workers who cut KV57 in which Horemheb was buried. The geologist Stephen Cross has argued that a major flood deposited this layer after KV62 was last sealed and before the huts were built which would mean Tutankhamuns tomb had been rendered inaccessible by the time Ays reign ended.11 However the Egyptologist Andreas Dorn suggests that this layer already existed during Tutankhamuns reign and workers dug through it to reach the bedrock into which they cut his tomb.12 More than 150 years after Tutankhamuns burial KV9 the tomb of Ramesses V and Ramesses VI was cut into the rock to the west of his tomb.13 The entrance of his tomb was further buried by mounds of debris from KV
9 s excavation and by the workers huts atop that debris. In subsequent years the tombs in the valley suffered major waves of robbery first during the late Twentieth Dynasty by local gangs of thieves then during the Twentyfirst Dynasty by officials working for the High Priests of Amun who stripped the tombs of their valuables and removed the royal mummies. Tutankhamuns tomb buried and forgotten remained undisturbed.14 Discovery and clearanceedit Main article Discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun Several tombs in the Valley of the Kings lay open continuously from ancient times onward but the entrances to many others remained hidden until after the emergence of Egyptology in the early nineteenth century.15 Many of the remaining tombs were found by a series of excavators working for Theodore M. Davis from 1902 to 1914. Under Davis most of the valley was explored although he never found Tutankhamuns tomb because he thought no tomb would have been cut into the valley floor.16 Among his discoveries was KV54 a pit containing objects bearing Tutankhamuns name these objects are now thought to have been either burial goods that were originally stored in the corridor of Tutankhamuns tomb which were removed and reburied in KV54 when the restorers filled the corridor or objects related to Tutankhamuns funeral. Daviss excavators also discovered a small tomb called KV58 that contained pieces of a chariot harness bearing the names of Tutankhamun and Ay. Davis was convinced that KV58 was Tutankhamuns tomb.17 The northwest corner of the antechamber as photographed in 1922. The plaster partition between the antechamber and burial chamber is on the right. After Davis gave up work on the valley the archaeologist Howard Carter and his patron George Herbert 
5 th Earl of Carnarvon made an effort to clear the valley of debris down to the bedrock. Daviss finds of artefacts bearing Tutankhamuns name gave them reason to hope they might find his tomb.18 The discovery began on 4 November 1922 with a single step at the top of the entrance staircase.19 When the excavators reached the antechamber on 26 November it exceeded all expectations providing unprecedented insight into what a New Kingdom royal burial was like.20 Workmen move goods from the tomb along a Decauville railroad track to the Nile. The condition of the burial goods varied greatly many had been profoundly affected by moisture which probably derived from both the damp state of the plaster when the tomb was first sealed and from water seepage over the millennia until it was excavated.21 Recording the tombs contents and conserving them so they could survive to be transported to Cairo proved to be an unprecedented task lasting for ten digging seasons.2223 Although many others participated the only members of the excavation team who worked throughout the process were Carter Alfred Lucas a chemist who was instrumental in the conservation effort Harry Burton who photographed the tomb and its artefacts and four foremen Ahmed Gerigar Gad Hassan Hussein Abu Awad and Hussein Ahmed Said.24 The spectacular nature of the tomb goods inspired a media frenzy dubbed Tutmania that made Tutankhamun into one of the most famous pharaohs often known by the nickname King Tut.2526 In the Western world the publicity inspired a fad for ancient Egyptianinspired design motifs.27 In Egypt it reinforced the ideology of pharaonism which emphasized modern Egypts connection to its ancient past and had risen to prominence during Egypts struggle for independence from British rule from 1919 to 19
22.2 8 The publicity increased when Carnarvon died of an infection in April 1923 inspiring rumours that he had been killed by a curse on the tomb. Other deaths or strange events connected with the tomb came to be attributed to the curse as well.29 After Carnarvons death the tomb clearance continued under Carters leadership. In the second season of the process in late 1923 and early 1924 the antechamber was emptied of artefacts and work began on the burial chamber.30 The Egyptian government which had become partially independent in 1922 fought with Carter over the question of access to the tomb the government felt that Egyptians and especially the Egyptian press were given too little access. In protest of the governments increasing restrictions Carter and his associates stopped work in February 1924 beginning a legal dispute that lasted until January 1925. Under the agreement that resolved the dispute the artefacts from the tomb would not be divided between the government and the digs sponsors as had been standard practice on previous Egyptological digs.31 Instead most of the tombs contents went to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.32 The excavators opened and removed Tutankhamuns coffins and mummy in 1925 then spent the next few seasons working on the treasury and annexe. The clearance of the tomb itself was completed in November 1930 though Carter and Lucas continued to work on conserving the remaining burial goods until February 1932 when the last shipment was sent to Cairo.33 Tourism and preservationedit The sign outside of the entrance to tomb of Tutankhamun in Arabic and English. The tomb has been a popular tourist destination ever since the clearance process began.34 Sometime after the mummy was reinterred in 1926 someone broke into the sarcophagus stealing objects Carter had left in place. A likely time for the event is the Second World War when a shortage of security workers led to widespread looting of Egyptian antiquities. The body was subsequently rewrapped suggesting local officials may have discovered the breakin and restored the mummy without reporting what had happened. The theft was not exposed until 1968 after the anatomist Ronald Harrison reexamined Tutankhamuns remains.35 Most tombs in the Valley of the Kings tombs are vulnerable to flash flooding.36 When analysing Tutankhamuns tomb in 1927 Lucas concluded that despite the moisture seepage no significant liquid water had entered before its discovery.37 In contrast since the discovery water has periodically trickled in through the entrance and on New Years Day in 1991 a rainstorm flooded the tomb through a fault in the burial chamber ceiling. The flood stained the painted chamber wall and left about 7 centimetres 
2.8  in of standing water on the floor.38 Tombs are also threatened by the tourists who visit them who may damage the wall decoration with their touch and with the moisture introduced by their breath.36 The mummy is also vulnerable to this kind of damage so in 2007 it was moved to a climatecontrolled glass display case that was placed in the antechamber allowing it to be displayed to the public while protecting it from humidity and mould.39 The Society of Friends of the Royal Tombs of Egypt suggested the idea of creating a replica of Tutankhamuns tomb in 1988 so that tourists could see it without further damaging the original.40 In 2009 Factum Arte a workshop that specialises in replicas of largescale artworks took detailed scans of the burial chamber on which to base a replica40 while the Egyptian government and the Getty Conservation Institute launched a longterm project to assess the condition of the tomb and renovate it as needed.41 The replica was completed in 2012 and opened to the public in 201440 the renovation was completed in 20
19.4 2 In 2015 the Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves argued based on Factum Artes scans that the west and north walls of the burial chamber included previously unnoticed plaster partitions. That would suggest the tomb contained two previously unknown chambers one behind each partition which Reeves suggested were the burial place of Neferneferuaten. The Ministry of Antiquities commissioned a groundpenetrating radar examination later that year which seemed to show voids behind the chamber walls but followup radar examinations in 2016 and 2018 determined that there are no such voids and therefore no hidden chambers.43 Tutankhamuns tomb is in higher demand from tourists than any other in the Valley of the Kings. Up to 1000 people pass through it on its busiest days.44 Architectureedit Plan of the tomb 
3 Dimage of the tomb Tutankhamuns tomb lies in the eastern branch of the Valley of the Kings where most tombs in the valley are located.45 It is cut into the limestone bedrock in the valley floor on the west side of the main path and runs beneath a low foothill.46 Its design is similar to those of nonroyal tombs from its time but elaborated so as to resemble the conventional plan of a royal tomb.47 It consists of a westwarddescending stairway labeled A in the conventional Egyptological system for designating parts of royal tombs in the valley an eastwest descending corridor B an antechamber at the west end of the passage I an annexe adjoining the southwest corner of the antechamber Ia a burial chamber north of the antechamber J and a room east of the burial chamber Ja known as the treasury.48 The burial chamber and treasury may have been added to the original tomb when it was adapted for Tutankhamuns burial.47 Most Eighteenth Dynasty royal tombs used a layout with a bent axis so that a person moving from the entrance to the burial chamber would take a sharp turn to the left along the way. By placing Tutankhamuns burial chamber north of the antechamber the builders of KV62 gave it a layout with an axis bent to the right rather than the left.4950 The entrance stair descends steeply beneath an overhang.5 It originally consisted of sixteen steps. The lowest six were cut away during the burial to make room to maneuver the largest pieces of funerary furniture through the doorway then rebuilt then removed again 3400 years later when the excavators removed that same furniture. The corridor is 8 metres 26 ft long and 
1.7  metres 5 ft 7 in wide the antechamber is 
7.9  metres 26 ft northsouth by 
3.6  metres 12 ft eastwest the annexe is 
4.4  metres 14 ft northsouth by 
2.6  metres 8 ft 6 in eastwest the burial chamber is 4 metres 13 ft northsouth by 
6.4  metres 21 ft eastwest and the treasury is 
4.8  metres 16 ft northsouth by 
3.8  metres 12 ft eastwest. The chambers range from 
2.3  metres 7 ft 7 in to 
3.6  metres 12 ft high and the floors of the annexe burial chamber and treasury are about 
0.9  metres 2 ft 11 in below the floor of the antechamber. In the west wall of the antechamber is a small niche for a beam that was used for manoeuvring the sarcophagus through the room.51 The burial chamber contains four niches one in each wall in which were placed magic bricks inscribed with protective spells.5152 Partitions constructed of limestone and plaster originally sealed the doorways between the stairway and the corridor between the corridor and the antechamber between the antechamber and the annexe and between the antechamber and the burial chamber. All were breached by robbers. Most were resealed by the restorers but the robbers hole in the annexe doorway was left open.53 There are several faults in the rock into which the tomb is cut including a large one that runs southsoutheast to northnorthwest across the antechamber and burial chamber.54 Although the workmen who cut the tomb sealed the fault in the burial chamber with plaster55 the faults are responsible for the water seepage that affects the tomb.54 Decorationedit Scenes from the north wall of the burial chamber. On the left side Tutankhamun followed by his ka an aspect of his soul embraces the god Osiris. In the center Tutankhamun greeting the goddess Nut. On the right side Ay performing the opening of the mouth for Tutankhamun.56 The plaster partitions were marked with impressions from seals borne by various officials who oversaw Tutankhamuns burial and the restoration efforts. These seals consist of hieroglyphic text that celebrates Tutankhamuns services to the gods during his reign.57 Aside from these seal impressions the only wall decoration in the tomb is in the burial chamber. This limited decorative programme contrasts with other royal tombs of the late Eighteenth Dynasty in which two chambers in addition to the burial chamber often received decoration and with the practice in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties in which all parts of the tomb were decorated. None of the decoration is executed in relief a technique that was not used in the Valley of the Kings until the reign of Horemheb.58 Reconstruction of the scenes from the south wall of the burial chamber based on the remaining wall decoration and Carters photographs. On the right is Tutankhamun greeting the goddess Hathor followed by Anubis. On the left is three figures behind the goddess Isis. The left side of the wall was painted on the partition wall and had to be demolished by Carter in order to remove the shrines from the burial chamber. KV
62 s burial chamber is painted with figures on a yellow background. The east wall portrays Tutankhamuns funeral procession a type of image that is common in private New Kingdom tombs but not found in any other royal tomb. The north wall shows Ay performing the Opening of the Mouth ritual upon Tutankhamuns mummy thus legitimising himself as the kings heir and then Tutankhamun greeting the goddess Nut and the god Osiris in the afterlife. The south wall portrayed the king with the deities Hathor Anubis and Isis. Part of the decoration of this wall was painted on the partition dividing the burial chamber from the antechamber and thus the figure of Isis had to be destroyed by Carter when the partition was demolished during the tomb clearance. The west wall bears an image of twelve baboons which is an extract from the first section of the Amduat a funerary text that describes the journey of the sun god Ra through the netherworld. On three walls the figures are given the unusual proportions found in the art style of the Amarna Period although the south wall reverts to the conventional proportions found in art before and after Amarna.59 Scenes from the west wall of the burial chamber showing images of twelve baboons which is an extract from the first section of the Amduat a funerary text that describes the journey of the sun god Ra through the netherworld. Scenes from the east wall of the burial chamber showing court officials dragging Tutankhamuns mummy to his tomb. Horemheb is possibly depicted as the person closest to Tutankhamuns mummy. Burial goodsedit Tutankhamuns tomb was provided with vast quantities of wealth such as the mask of Tutankhamun. The contents of the tomb are by far the most complete example of a royal set of burial goods in the Valley of the Kings60 numbered at 5398 objects.61 Some classes of object number in the hundreds there are 413 shabtis figurines intended to do work for the king in the afterlife and more than 200 pieces of jewellery.62 Objects were present in all four chambers in the tomb as well as the corridor.63 The efforts of the robbers followed by the hasty restoration effort left much of the tomb in disarray when it was last sealed.64 By the time of the discovery many of the objects had been damaged by alternating periods of humidity and dryness.65 Nearly all leather in the tomb had dissolved into a pitchlike mass and while the state of preservation of textiles was highly inconsistent the worstpreserved had turned into a black powder.66 Wooden objects were warped and their glues dissolved leaving them in a very fragile state.65 Every exposed surface was covered with an unidentified pink film67 Lucas suggested it was some kind of dissolved iron compound that came from the rock or the plaster.68 In the process of cleaning restoring and removing the damaged artefacts the excavators labeled each object or group of objects with a number from 1 to 620 appending letters to distinguish individual objects within a group.69 Outer chambersedit The corridor may have contained miscellaneous materials such as bags of natron jars and flower garlands that were moved to KV54 when the corridor was filled after the first robbery.63 Other objects and fragments were incorporated into the corridor fill. One wellknown artefact a wooden bust of Tutankhamun was apparently found in the corridor when it was excavated but it was not recorded in Carters initial excavation notes.70 The lotus chalice from the antechamber with the god Heh depicted atop the handles. The antechamber contained 600 to 700 objects. Its west side was taken up by a tangled pile of furniture among which miscellaneous small objects such as baskets of fruit and boxes of meat were placed. Several dismantled chariots took up the southeast corner while the northeast contained a collection of funerary bouquets and the north end of the chamber was dominated by two lifesize statues of Tutankhamun that flanked the entrance to the burial chamber.71 These statues are thought to have either served as guardians of the burial chamber or as figures representing the kings ka an aspect of his soul.72 Among the significant objects in the antechamber were several funerary beds with animal heads which dominated the cluster of furniture against the west wall an alabaster lotus chalice and a painted box depicting Tutankhamun in battle which Carter regarded as one of the finest works of art in the tomb. Carter thought even more highly of a gilded and inlaid throne depicting Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun in the art style of the Amarna Period he called it the most beautiful thing that has yet been found in Egypt.73 Boxes in the antechamber contained most of the clothing in the tomb including tunics shirts kilts gloves and sandals as well as cosmetics such as unguents and kohl.74 Scattered in various places in the antechamber were pieces of gold and semiprecious stones from a corselet a ceremonial version of the armor that Egyptian kings wore into battle. Reconstructing the corselet was one of the most complex tasks the excavators faced.75 This room also contained a wooden dummy of Tutankhamuns head and torso. Its purpose is uncertain although it bears marks that may indicate it once wore a corselet and Carter suggested it was a mannequin for the kings clothes.76 The annexe contained more than 2000 individual artefacts. Its original contents were jumbled together with objects that had been haphazardly replaced during the restoration after the robberies including beds stools and stone and pottery vessels containing wine and oils.77 The room housed most of the tombs foodstuffs most of the shabtis and many of its wooden funerary models such as models of boats.78 Much of the weaponry in the tomb such as bows throwing sticks and khopeshswords as well as ceremonial shields were found here.79 Other objects in the annexe were personal possessions that Tutankhamun seemingly used as a child such as toys a box of paints and a firelighting kit.80 A bust of Tutankhamun found in the corridor A painted chest from the antechamber A chariot reassembled from the pieces in the antechamber Two of the embroidered gloves found in the antechamber and annexe81 Ceremonial shield from the annexe A calcite model boat from the annexe A senet gameboard from the annexe Shabtis many of which were found in the annexe Burial chamberedit The shrines and the sarcophagus they enclosed shown to scale. Most of the space in the burial chamber was taken up by the gilded wooden outer shrine enclosing three nested inner shrines and within them a stone sarcophagus containing three nested coffins. Also a wooden frame stood between the outermost and second shrines which was covered with a blue linen pall spangled with bronze rosettes. Yet even this chamber contained burial goods including jars religious objects such as imiut fetishes oars fans and walking sticks some of which were inserted in the narrow gaps between shrines.82 Each wall of the chamber bore a niche containing a brick83 of a type that Egyptologists call magic bricks because they are inscribed with passages from Spell 151 from the funerary text known as the Book of the Dead and are intended to ward off threats to the dead.52 The decoration of the shrines executed in relief includes portions of several funerary texts. All four shrines bear extracts from the Book of the Dead and further extracts from the Amduat are on the third shrine.84 The outermost shrine is inscribed with the earliest known copy of the Book of the Heavenly Cow which describes how Ra reshaped the world into its current form.85 The second shrine bears a funerary text that is found nowhere else although texts with similar themes are known from the tombs of Ramesses VI KV9 and Ramesses IX KV6. Like them it describes the sun god and the netherworld using a cryptic form of hieroglyphic writing that uses nonstandard meanings for each hieroglyphic sign. These three texts are sometimes labeled enigmatic books or books of the solarOsirian unity.8687 The sarcophagus is made of quartzite but with a red granite lid painted yellow to match the quartzite. It is carved with the images of four protective goddesses Isis Nephthys Neith and Serqet and contained a golden lionheaded bier on which rested three nested coffins in human shape. The outer two coffins were made of gilded wood inlaid with glass and semiprecious stones while the innermost coffin though similarly inlaid was primarily composed of 1
10.4  kilograms 243 lb of solid gold.88 Within it lay Tutankhamuns mummified body. On the body and contained within the layers of mummy wrappings were 143 items including articles of clothing such as sandals a plethora of amulets and other jewellery and two daggers. Tutankhamuns head bore a beaded skullcap and a gold diadem all of which was encased in the golden mask of Tutankhamun which has become one of the most iconic ancient Egyptian artefacts in the world.89 Imiut fetishes from the burial chamber Diagram of shrines and coffins in the tomb The middle coffin from the burial chamber The inner coffin from the burial chamber The iron dagger found on Tutankhamuns body Treasuryedit The Anubis Shrine in situ at the entrance of the Treasury. In the doorway of the treasury stood a shrine on carrying poles topped by a statue of the jackal god Anubis in front of which lay a fifth magic brick.90 Against the east wall of the treasury was a tall gilded shrine containing the canopic chest in which Tutankhamuns internal organs were placed after mummification. Whereas most canopic chests contain separate jars Tutankhamuns consists of a single block of alabaster carved into four compartments each covered by a humanheaded stopper and containing an inlaid gold coffinette that housed one of the kings organs.91 Between the Anubis shrine and the canopic shrine stood a wooden sculpture of a cows head representing the goddess Hathor. The treasury was the location of most of the tombs wooden models including more boats and a model granary as well as many of the shabtis.92 Boxes in the treasury contained miscellaneous items including much of the tombs jewellery.93 A nested set of small coffins in the treasury contained a lock of hair belonging to Tiye the wife of Amenhotep III who is thought to have been Tutankhamuns grandmother. One box contained two miniature coffins in which mummies of Tutankhamuns stillborn daughters were interred.94 Portable shrine with a statue Anubis exposition in Paris The Anubis shrine from the entrance to the treasury A box from the treasury shaped like the cartouche of Tutankhamuns name A pendant in the shape of a winged scarab carrying the Eye of Horus from the treasury The canopic shrine from the treasury The canopic chest from the treasury with three of the four stoppers present Figurines of deities found in the treasury Significanceedit The volume of goods in Tutankhamuns tomb is often taken as a sign that longerlived kings who had fullsize tombs were buried with an even larger array of objects. Yet Tutankhamuns burial goods barely fit into his tomb so the Egyptologist Joyce Tyldesley argues that larger tombs in the valley may have contained assemblages of similar size that were arranged in a more orderly and spacious manner.95 This statuette of Tutankhamun standing on a panther closely resembles images from the tomb of Seti II.96 The fragmentary remains of burial goods in other tombs in the Valley of the Kings include many of the same objects found in Tutankhamuns implying that there was a somewhat standard set of object types for royal burials in this era. The lifesize statues of Tutankhamun and the statuettes of deities have parallels in several other tombs in the valley while the statuettes of Tutankhamun himself are closely paralleled by wall paintings in KV15 the tomb of Seti II. Funerary models such as Tutankhamuns model boats were mainly a feature of burials in the Old and Middle Kingdoms and fell out of favour in nonroyal burials in the New but several royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings contained them. Conversely Tutankhamuns tomb contained no funerary texts on papyri unlike private tombs from its era but the existence of an excerpt of the Book of the Dead on a papyrus from KV35 the tomb of Amenhotep II suggests that their absence in Tutankhamuns tomb may have been unusual.97 No papyrus texts at all were among the burial goodsa disappointment to Egyptologists who hoped to find documents that would clarify the history of the Amarna Period. Instead much of the value of the discovery was in the insight it provided into the material culture of ancient Egypt.98 Among the furniture was a foldable bed the only intact example known from ancient Egypt.99 Some of the boxes could be latched with the turn of a knob and Carter called them the oldest known examples of such a mechanism.100 Other everyday items include musical instruments such as a pair of trumpets a variety of weapons including a dagger made of iron a rare commodity in Tutankhamuns time and about 130 staffs including one bearing the label a reed staff which His Majesty cut with his own hand.101 Tutankhamuns clothesloose tunics robes and sashes often elaborately decorated with dye embroidery or beadworkexhibit more variety than the clothes depicted in art from his time which consist largely of plain white kilts and tight sheaths. No crowns were found in the tomb although crooks and flails which also served as emblems of kingship were stored there. Tyldesley suggests that crowns may have not been considered personal property of the king and were instead passed down from reign to reign.102 Some of the objects in the tomb shed limited light on the end of the Amarna Period. A piece of a box found in the corridor bears the names of Akhenaten Neferneferuaten and Akhenatens daughter Meryetaten while a calcite jar from the tomb bore two erased royal names that have been reconstructed as those of Akhenaten and Smenkhkare. These are key pieces of evidence in attempts to reconstruct the relationships between members of the royal family and the sequence in which they reigned although scholars interpretations have varied greatly.103104 The faces of Tutankhamuns second coffin and his canopic coffinettes differ from the faces of most portrayals of him so these items may originally have been made for another ruler such as Smenkhkare or Neferneferuaten and reused for Tutankhamuns burial.105106 The backrest of the gilded and inlaid throne portraying Ankhesenamun anointing Tutankhamun107 Some objects bear evidence of the shift in religious policy in Tutankhamuns reign.108 The golden throne portrays Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun beneath the rays of the Aten in the Amarna art style.107 The king and queen are labeled with the later forms of their names referring to Amun rather than the Aten but there are signs that these labels were altered after the throne was made and the openwork arms and back of the throne bear the kings original name Tutankhaten.108 A sceptre from the annexe bears an inscription mentioning both the Aten and Amun implying an attempt to integrate the two religious systems.109 Other information about the reign is provided by wine jars which are labeled by the year in which they were produced. Jars that are explicitly labeled as coming from Tutankhamuns reign range from Year 5 to Year 9 while one jar from an unidentified reign is labeled Year 10 and another Year 31. The Year 31 wine probably comes from the reign of Amenhotep III so the remaining jars suggest that Tutankhamun reigned for nine or ten years.2110 The flowers and fruits in the funerary garlands would have been available from midMarch to midApril indicating that Tutankhamuns funeral took place then.111 The royal annals of the Hittite Empire record a letter from an unnamed Egyptian queen referred to as Dakhamunzu recently widowed by the death of a pharaoh and offering to marry a Hittite prince. The dead king is most commonly thought to be Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun the sender of the letter but the letter indicates the king in question died in August or September meaning either that Tutankhamun was not the king in the Hittite annals or that he remained unburied far longer than the traditional 
70 day period of mummification and mourning.112 The thefts make Tutankhamuns tomb one of the most important sources for understanding tomb robbery and restoration in the New Kingdom particularly for the early part of that period when robberies were more opportunistic than the largescale plundering that took place in the late Twentieth Dynasty.113 Many of the boxes in the tomb bear dockets in hieratic writing that list their original contents making it possible to partially reconstruct what the tomb originally held and which items were lost. The dockets of the jewellery boxes in the treasury for instance indicate that about 60 percent of their contents is missing.114 Thieves would have prized what was valuable portable and either untraceable or possible to disguise through dismantling or melting.115 Most of the metal vessels originally buried with Tutankhamun were stolen as were those of glass indicating that glass was a valuable commodity at the time. The robbers also took bedding and cosmetics the theft of the latter shows that the robberies took place soon after burial as the Egyptians fatbased unguents would have turned rancid within a few years.116 One of the boxes in the antechamber contained a set of gold rings wrapped in a scarf which Carter believed had been dropped by the thieves and placed in the box by the restorers. The unlikelihood that robbers would forget something so valuable led him to suggest they had been caught in the act.117 The broken objects found in the fill of the corridor all came from the antechamber implying that the first group of thieves only had access to that chamber and that it was the second group who reached as far as the treasury.118 A man named Djehutymose apparently the official who carried out the restoration of the tomb wrote his name on a jar stand in the annexe. The same man left a note in KV43 the tomb of Thutmose IV recording the restoration of that tomb in Year 8 of the reign of Horemheb.119 These two tombs were among several in the Valley of the Kings that were robbed at the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty suggesting that political uncertainty following Tutankhamuns death caused a weakening of security there.8 Dispositionedit Further information Exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun After the completion of the clearance in 1932 the tomb was emptied of nearly all its contents. The main exceptions were the sarcophagus with its original lid replaced by a glass plate and the outermost of the three coffins in which Tutankhamuns mummy was placed.120121 Carter also took a handful of small artefacts from the tomb without permission upon his death his heir Phyllis Walker discovered them and had them returned to the Egyptian government. A few items are suspected of having illicitly made their way into other collections of Egyptian antiquities but their provenance is uncertain.122 For several decades after his tomb was cleared the overwhelming majority of Tutankhamuns burial goods were stored at either the Egyptian Museum in Cairo or Luxor Museum. Only the most major pieces have been on display while the rest have been in storage at one of the two sites.32 Selected pieces have also gone on museum exhibition tours raising money for the Egyptian government32 and serving to improve its relations with the host countries.123 There have been several exhibitions visiting Europe North America Japan and Australia in three major phases one from 1961 to 1967 another from 1972 to 1981 and a third from 2004 to 2013. Many exhibitions of replicas have also taken place beginning with a set made for the British Empire Exhibition in 19
24.1 24 Beginning in 2011 the objects from the tomb were gradually transferred to the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza.125 Upon its opening the museum is planned to display all the tombs artefacts.126 Mummiesedit Main articles Tutankhamuns mummy and 3

17 b mummies Tutankhamuns mummy as photographed in 1926 before being returned to the sarcophagus.127128 When it was uncovered in November 1925 Tutankhamuns mummy was in poor condition.129 The unguents that were poured over the wrappings before burial had undergone a chemical reaction that Lucas called some kind of slow spontaneous combustion possibly caused by fungi in the tomb.130 As a result most of the wrappings and even much of the tissues in the mummy had been carbonised.131 Tutankhamuns condition contrasted with the much betterpreserved mummies of other New Kingdom rulers.132 These mummies had been removed from their plundered tombs placed in simpler coffins and buried in two caches during the Twentyfirst Dynasty a few centuries after they were originally entombed.133 It is not known whether they suffered less deterioration because they were less liberally treated with unguents or because their removal from their original coffins prevented the unguents from soaking through the wrappings.131132 The solidified unguents glued together Tutankhamuns remains his mummy wrappings and the objects on his body forming a single mass stuck to the bottom of the coffin encasing it. The excavators concluded that to remove the mummy and extricate the burial goods they would have to cut it into sections chiseling each piece out of its setting. Two anatomists Douglas Derry and Saleh Bey Hamdi examined the pieces as they came free before coating the fragile flesh in paraffin wax to prevent further deterioration.134 They determined that Tutankhamun had been close to the age of 18 when he died and that his skull shape closely resembling that of an unidentified royal mummy from KV55 showed he was of royal blood rather than having married into the royal family as Egyptologists had previously believed.135136 When the examination concluded Carter placed the dismembered mummy on a sand tray which he returned to the sarcophagus in the burial chamber the following year.137 The mummified fetuses found in the treasury are at different stages of development one at five months gestation and the other at seven to nine. Their coffins do not specify names so they are designated based on the object number of the box that contained them 317 the smaller fetus is known as 3

2.1 38 They were examined by Derry in 1932139 and subsequently stored at the medical school where he worked now part of Cairo University.140 Tutankhamuns mummy has often been analysed to see what health conditions he had and particularly to determine his cause of death. Such efforts are often contentious as it is difficult to distinguish damage inflicted on the body in recent times from damage Tutankhamun suffered while alive. For instance in 1996 the Egyptologist Bob Brier suggested that fragments of bone in the skull cavity seen in the Xrays that Harrison had taken in 1968 were a sign that Tutankhamun had died of a blow to the head and might have been murdered. The bone fragments were later found to be fragments of vertebrae that were pushed into the skull cavity during Derrys examination.141142 The fetuses have faced similar problems Harrison in 1977 said 3
17 b2 had Sprengels deformity but a study in 2011 by the radiologist Sahar Saleem argued that the signs of deformity were actually postmortem damage.143 Both Tutankhamuns mummy and the fetuses have undergone genetic testing. A 2010 study of the DNA of many of the mummies from the Valley of the Kings announced that the fetuses were Tutankhamuns children by a woman whose mummy was found in KV21 who was presumed to be Ankhesenamun. However the results of genetic studies of Egyptian mummies have been questioned by several geneticists such as Svante Pbo who argue that DNA breaks down so rapidly in Egypts heat that remains more than a few centuries old cannot produce an analysable DNA sample.144 Replicaedit The replica of the burial chamber includes copies of the wall decoration and of the sarcophagus. Both were reproduced based on highly detailed scans. The replica was presented to the Egyptian government in 2012 and installed next to Carter House where Carter lived while working on the tomb near the entrance to the Valley of the Kings.40145 Referencesedit Citationsedit  Reeves 1990 p. 24.  a b Tyldesley 2012 p. 165.
