He was born in Leptis Magna presentday AlKhums Libya in the Roman province of Africa.56 As a young man he advanced through the customary succession of offices under the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. Severus was the final contender to seize power after the death of the emperor Pertinax in 193 during the Year of the Five Emperors. After deposing and killing the incumbent emperor Didius Julianus Severus fought his rival claimants the Roman generals Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus. Niger was defeated in 194 at the Battle of Issus in Cilicia. Later that year Severus waged a short punitive campaign beyond the eastern frontier annexing the Kingdom of Osroene as a new province. Severus defeated Albinus three years later at the Battle of Lugdunum in Gaul. Following the consolidation of his rule over the western provinces Severus waged another brief more successful war in the east against the Parthian Empire sacking their capital Ctesiphon in 197 and expanding the eastern frontier to the Tigris. He then enlarged and fortified the Limes Arabicus in Arabia Petraea. In 202 he campaigned in Africa and Mauretania against the Garamantes capturing their capital Garama and expanding the Limes Tripolitanus along the southern desert frontier of the empire. With his second wife Julia Domna Severus had two sons the elder Caracalla was proclaimed Augustus or coemperor in 198 and the younger Geta in 209. Severus travelled to Britain in 208 strengthening Hadrians Wall and reoccupying the Antonine Wall. In 209 he invaded Caledonia modern Scotland with an army of 50000 men7 but his ambitions were cut short when he died of an infectious disease in early 211 at Eboracum modern York. His sons advised by Julia Domna succeeded him thus founding the Severan dynasty. It was the last dynasty of the Roman Empire before the Crisis of the Third Century. Early lifeedit Family and educationedit Born on 11 April 145 at Leptis Magna in presentday Libya as the son of Publius Septimius Geta and Fulvia Pia3 Septimius Severus came from a wealthy and distinguished family of equestrian rank. Severus had Italic and Punic ancestry the Roman ancestry came from his mothers side while his Punic ancestry came from his fathers side.8 Severus was described as Libyan by race by the historian Cassius Dio.9 Due to his family background on his fathers side he is considered the first provincial emperor as he was the first emperor not only born in the provinces but also into a provincial family of nonItalian origin.10 Severus father an obscure provincial held no major political status but he had two cousins Publius Septimius Aper and Gaius Septimius Severus who served as consuls under the emperor Antoninus Pius r.138161. His mothers ancestors had moved from Italy to North Africa they belonged to the gens Fulvia an Italian patrician family that originated in Tusculum.11 Septimius Severus had two siblings an elder brother Publius Septimius Geta and a younger sister Septimia Octavilla. Severus maternal cousin was the praetorian prefect and consul Gaius Fulvius Plautianus.12 Septimius Severus grew up in Leptis Magna. He spoke the local Punic language fluently but he was also educated in Latin and Greek which he spoke with a slight accent. Little else is known of the young Severus education but according to Cassius Dio the boy had been eager for more education than he actually received. Presumably Severus received lessons in oratory at the age of 17 he gave his first public speech.13 Public serviceedit Dynastic aureus of Septimius Severus minted in 202. The reverse feature the portraits of Geta right Julia Domna centre and Caracalla left.14 Inscription SEVERUS PIUS AVGUSTUS PONTIFEX MAXIMUS TRIBUNUS PLEBIS X CONSUL III  FELICITAS SAECVLI. Severus sought a public career in Rome in around 162. At the recommendation of his relative Gaius Septimius Severus the emperor Marcus Aurelius r.161180 granted him entry into the senatorial ranks.15 Membership in the senatorial order was a prerequisite to attain positions within the cursus honorum and to gain entry into the Roman Senate. Nevertheless it appears that Severus career during the 1
60 s met with some difficulties.16 It is likely that he served as a vigintivir in Rome overseeing road maintenance in or near the city and he may have appeared in court as an advocate.16 At the time of Marcus Aurelius he was the State Attorney Advocatus fisci.17 However he omitted the military tribunate from the cursus honorum and had to delay his quaestorship until he had reached the required minimum age of 
25.1 6 To make matters worse the Antonine Plague swept through the capital in 1
66.1 8 With his career at a halt Severus decided to temporarily return to Leptis where the climate was healthier.18 According to the Historia Augusta a usually unreliable source he was prosecuted for adultery during this time but the case was ultimately dismissed. At the end of 169 Severus was of the required age to become a quaestor and journeyed back to Rome. On 5 December he took office and was officially enrolled in the Roman Senate.19 Between 170 and 180 his activities went largely unrecorded in spite of the fact that he occupied an impressive number of posts in quick succession. The Antonine Plague had thinned the senatorial ranks and with capable men now in short supply Severus career advanced more steadily than it otherwise might have.20 The sudden death of his father necessitated another return to Leptis Magna to settle family affairs. Before he was able to leave Africa Mauri tribesmen invaded southern Spain. Control of the province was handed over to the emperor while the Senate gained temporary control of Sardinia as compensation. Thus Septimius Severus spent the remainder of his second term as quaestor on the island of Sardinia.21 In 173 Severus cousin Gaius Septimius Severus was appointed proconsul of the province of Africa Proconsularis and chose Severus as one of his two legati pro praetore a senior military appointment.22 Following the end of this term Septimius Severus returned to Rome taking up office as tribune of the plebs a senior legislative position with the distinction of being the candidatus of the emperor.23 Marriagesedit The Severan Tondo c.199 Severus Julia Domna Caracalla and Geta whose face is erased Antikensammlung Berlin About 175 Septimius Severus in his early thirties at the time contracted his first marriage to Paccia Marciana a woman from Leptis Magna.24 He probably met her during his tenure as legate under his uncle. Marcianas name suggests Punic or Libyan origin but nothing else is known of her. Septimius Severus does not mention her in his autobiography though he commemorated her with statues when he became emperor. The unreliable Historia Augusta claims that Marciana and Severus had two daughters but no other attestation of them has survived. It appears that the marriage produced no surviving children despite lasting for more than ten years.23 Marciana died of natural causes around 1
86.2 5 Septimius Severus now in his forties childless and eager to remarry began enquiring into the horoscopes of prospective brides. The Historia Augusta relates that he heard of a woman in Syria of whom it had been foretold that she would marry a king and so Severus sought her as his wife.24 This woman was an Emesene Syrian named Julia Domna. Her father Julius Bassianus descended from the Arab Emesene dynasty and served as a high priest to the local cult of the sun god Elagabal.26 Domnas older sister Julia Maesa would become the grandmother of the future emperors Elagabalus and Alexander Severus.27 Bassianus accepted Severus marriage proposal in early 187 and in the summer the couple married in Lugdunum modernday Lyon France of which Severus was the governor.28 The marriage proved happy and Severus cherished Julia and her political opinions. Julia built the most splendid reputation by applying herself to letters and philosophy.29 They had two sons Lucius Septimius Bassianus later nicknamed Caracalla born 4 April 188 in Lugdunum and Publius Septimius Geta born 7 March 189 in Rome.30 Busts of Septimius Severus left and Julia Domna right Munich Glyptotek Rise to poweredit Roman marble bust of Septimius Severus early 
3 rd century AD Altes Museum In 191 on the advice of Quintus Aemilius Laetus prefect of the Praetorian Guard emperor Commodus appointed Severus as governor of Pannonia Superior.31 At around this time he is described by the classicist Kyle Harper as being a middling senator of modest physical stature and unexceptional accomplishment.32 Commodus was assassinated the following year. Pertinax was acclaimed emperor but he was then killed by the Praetorian Guard in early 1
93.3 3 In response to the murder of Pertinax Severus legion XIV Gemina acclaimed him emperor at Carnuntum on 9 April.3433 Nearby legions such as X Gemina at Vindobona soon followed suit. Having assembled an army Severus hurried to Italy.33 Pertinaxs successor in Rome Didius Julianus had bought the emperorship in an auction. Julianus was condemned to death by the Senate and killed.35 Severus took possession of Rome without opposition. He executed Pertinaxs murderers and dismissed the rest of the Praetorian Guard filling its ranks with loyal troops from his own legions.3637 The legions of Syria had proclaimed Pescennius Niger emperor. At the same time Severus felt it reasonable to offer Clodius Albinus the powerful governor of Britannia who had probably supported Didius against him the rank of Caesar which implied some claim to the succession. With his rear safe he moved to the East and crushed Nigers forces at the Battle of Issus 194. 37 While campaigning against Byzantium he ordered that the tomb of his fellowCarthaginian Hannibal be covered with fine marble.38 He devoted the following year to suppressing Mesopotamia and other Parthian vassals who had backed Niger. Afterwards Severus declared his son Caracalla as his successor which caused Albinus to be hailed emperor by his troops and to invade Gaul. After a short stay in Rome Severus moved north to meet him. On 19 February 197 at the Battle of Lugdunum with an army of about 75000 men mostly composed of Pannonian Moesian and Dacian legions and a large number of auxiliaries Severus defeated and killed Clodius Albinus securing his full control over the empire.394041 Upon returning to Rome Septimus had 29 senators executed for treason over their support of Albinus despite having previously taken an oath promising not to put any senators to death a customary oath for emperors.42 Emperoredit Golden Bust of Septimius Severus found in 1965 at Didymoteicho in Northern Greece now at the Archaeological Museum of Komotini. War against Parthiaedit Further information RomanParthian Wars The Roman Empire in 210 after the conquests of Severus showing Roman territory purple and Roman dependencies light purple Aureus minted in 193 by Septimius Severus to celebrate XIIII Gemina Martia Victrix the legion that proclaimed him emperor. Inscription IMP. CAE. L. SEP. SEV. PERTINAX AVG.  LEG. XIIII CEM. M. V.  TR. P. CONS. In early 197 Severus left Rome and sailed to the east. He embarked at Brundisium and probably landed at the port of Aegeae in Cilicia43 travelling on to Syria by land. He immediately gathered his army and crossed the Euphrates.44 Abgar IX titular King of Osroene but essentially only the ruler of Edessa since the annexation of his kingdom as a Roman province45 handed over his children as hostages and assisted Severus expedition by providing archers.46 King Khosrov I of Armenia also sent hostages money and gifts.47 Severus travelled on to Nisibis which his general Julius Laetus had prevented from falling into Parthian hands. Afterwards Severus returned to Syria to plan a more ambitious campaign.48 The following year he led another more successful campaign against the Parthian Empire reportedly in retaliation for the support it had given to Pescennius Niger. His legions sacked the Parthian royal city of Ctesiphon and he annexed the northern half of Mesopotamia to the empire4950 Severus took the title Parthicus Maximus following the example of Trajan.51 However he was unable to capture the fortress of Hatra even after two lengthy siegesjust like Trajan who had tried nearly a century before. During his time in the east though Severus also expanded the Limes Arabicus building new fortifications in the Arabian Desert from Basie to Dumatha.52 Relations with the Senate and Peopleedit Severus relations with the Senate were never good. He was unpopular with them from the outset having seized power with the help of the military and he returned the sentiment. Severus ordered the execution of a large number of Senators on charges of corruption or conspiracy against him and replaced them with his favourites. Although his actions turned Rome more into a military dictatorship he was popular with the citizens of Rome having stamped out the rampant corruption of Commodus reign. When he returned from his victory over the Parthians he erected the Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome.5354 According to Cassius Dio55 however after 197 Severus fell heavily under the influence of his Praetorian prefect Gaius Fulvius Plautianus who came to have almost total control of the imperial administration. At the same time a bloody power crisis erupted between Plautianus and Julia Domna Severus influential and powerful wife which had a relatively destructive effect on the centre of power. Plautianus daughter Fulvia Plautilla was married to Severus son Caracalla. Plautianus excessive power came to an end in 204 when he was denounced by the emperors dying brother. In January 205 Julia Domna and Caracalla accused Plautianus of plotting to kill him and Severus. The powerful prefect was executed while he was trying to defend his case in front of the two emperors.56 One of the two following praefecti was the famous jurist Papinian. Executions of senators did not stop Cassius Dio records that many of them were put to death some after being formally tried. After the assassination of Gaius Fulvius Plautianus in the rest of his reign he relied more on the advice of his clever and educated wife Julia Domna in the administration of the empire.57 Military reformsedit Bronze head of Septimius Severus from Asia Minor c. 195211 AD Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek Copenhagen. Inscription IMP. CAE. L. SEP. SEV. PERT. AVG.  LEG. XIIII CEM M V  TRP COS. Upon his arrival at Rome in 193 Severus discharged the Praetorian Guard36 which had murdered Pertinax and had then auctioned the Roman Empire to Didius Julianus. Its members were stripped of their ceremonial armour and forbidden to come within 160 kilometres 99 mi miles of the city on pain of death.58 Severus replaced the old guard with 10 new cohorts recruited from veterans of his Danubian legions.59 Around 197 he increased the number of legions from 30 to 33 with the introduction of the three new legions I II and III Parthica.60 He garrisoned Legio II Parthica at Albanum only 20 kilometres 12 mi from Rome.59 He gave his soldiers a donative of a thousand sesterces 250 denarii each61 and raised the annual wage for a soldier in the legions from 300 to 400 denarii.62 Severus was the first Roman emperor to station some of the imperial army in Italy. He realized that Rome needed a military central reserve with the capability to be sent anywhere.63 Reputed persecution of Christiansedit At the beginning of Severus reign Trajans policy toward the Christians was still in force. That is Christians were only to be punished if they refused to worship the emperor and the gods but they were not to be sought out.64 Therefore persecution was inconsistent local and sporadic. Faced with internal dissidence and external threats Severus felt the need to promote religious harmony by promoting syncretism.65 He possibly issued an edict66 that punished conversion to Judaism and Christianity.67 A number of persecutions of Christians occurred in the Roman Empire during his reign and are traditionally attributed to Severus by the early Christian community.68 This is based on the decree mentioned in the Historia Augusta66 an unreliable mix of fact and fiction.69 Early church historian Eusebius described Severus as a persecutor.70 The Christian apologist Tertullian stated that Severus was well disposed towards Christians71 employed a Christian as his personal physician and had personally intervened to save several highborn Christians known to him from the mob.69 Eusebius description of Severus as a persecutor likely derives merely from the fact that numerous persecutions occurred during his reign including those known in the Roman Martyrology as the martyrs of Madauros Charalambos and Perpetua and Felicity in Romanruled Africa. These were probably the result of local persecutions rather than empirewide actions or decrees by Severus.72 Military activityedit Africaedit In late 202 Severus launched a campaign in the province of Africa. The legatus legionis or commander of Legio III Augusta Quintus Anicius Faustus had been fighting against the Garamantes along the Limes Tripolitanus for five years. He captured several settlements such as Cydamus Gholaia Garbia and their capital Garamaover 600 kilometres 370 mi south of Leptis Magna.73 The province of Numidia was also enlarged the empire annexed the settlements of Vescera Castellum Dimmidi Gemellae Thabudeos and Thubunae.74 By 203 the entire southern frontier of Roman Africa had been dramatically expanded and refortified. Desert nomads could no longer safely raid the regions interior and escape back into the Sahara.49 The expansion of the African frontier during the reign of Severus medium tan. Severus even briefly held a military presence in Garama in 203 light tan. Britainedit Further information Roman invasion of Caledonia 208210 Kushan ring with portraits of Septimius Severus and Julia Domna a testimony to IndoRoman relations of the period In 208 Severus travelled to Britain with the intention of conquering Caledonia. Modern archaeological discoveries illuminate the scope and direction of his northern campaign.75 Severus probably arrived in Britain with an army of over 40000 considering some of the camps constructed during his campaign could house this number.76 He strengthened Hadrians Wall and reconquered the Southern Uplands up to the Antonine Wall which was also enhanced. Supported and supplied by a strong naval force77 Severus then thrust north with his army across the wall into Caledonian territory. Retracing the steps of Agricola of over a century before Severus rebuilt and garrisoned many abandoned Roman forts along the east coast such as Carpow.78 Cassius Dios account of the invasion reads Severus accordingly desiring to subjugate the whole of it invaded Caledonia. But as he advanced through the country he experienced countless hardships in cutting down the forests levelling the heights filling up the swamps and bridging the rivers but he fought no battle and beheld no enemy in battle array. The enemy purposely put sheep and cattle in front of the soldiers for them to seize in order that they might be lured on still further until they were worn out for in fact the water caused great suffering to the Romans and when they became scattered they would be attacked. Then unable to walk they would be slain by their own men in order to avoid capture so that a full fifty thousand died. But Severus did not desist until he approached the extremity of the island. Here he observed most accurately the variation of the suns motion and the length of the days and the nights in summer and winter respectively. Having thus been conveyed through practically the whole of the hostile country for he actually was conveyed in a covered litter most of the way on account of his infirmity he returned to the friendly portion after he had forced the Britons to come to terms on the condition that they should abandon a large part of their territory.79 By 210 Severus campaigning had made significant gains despite Caledonian guerrilla tactics and purportedly heavy Roman casualties.80 The Caledonians sued for peace which Severus granted on condition they relinquish control of the Central Lowlands.7581 This is evidenced by extensive Severanera fortifications in the Central Lowlands.82 The Caledonians short on supplies and feeling that their position was desperate revolted later that year with the Maeatae.83 Severus prepared for another protracted campaign within Caledonia. He was now intent on exterminating the Caledonians telling his soldiers Let noone escape sheer destruction noone our hands not even the babe in the womb of the mother if it be male let it nevertheless not escape sheer destruction.7784 Deathedit Severus campaign was cut short when he fell ill.8586 He withdrew to Eboracum York and died there in 2
11.4  Although his son Caracalla continued campaigning the following year he soon settled for peace. The Romans never campaigned deep into Caledonia again. Shortly after this the frontier was permanently withdrawn south to Hadrians Wall.86 Severus is famously said to have given the advice to his sons Be harmonious enrich the soldiers scorn all others before he died on 4 February 2
11.8 7 On his death Severus was deified by the Senate and succeeded by his sons Caracalla and Geta who were advised by his wife Julia Domna.88 Severus was buried in the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.

Assessment and legacyedit The Arch of Septimius Severus at Leptis Magna By the close of his reign the Roman Empire reached an extent of over 5 million square kilometres which scholars like David L. Kennedy Lukas De Blois and Derrick Riley state expanded the empire to its greatest physical extent.899091929394 Edward Gibbon famously levelled a harsh indictment of Septimius Severus as a principal agent in the empires decline. The contemporaries of Severus in the enjoyment of the peace and glory of his reign forgave the cruelties by which it had been introduced. Posterity who experienced the fatal effects of his maxims and example justly considered him as the principal author of the decline of the Roman empire. According to Gibbon his daring ambition ... was never diverted from its steady course by the allurements of pleasure the apprehension of danger or the feelings of humanity.95 His enlargement of the Limes Tripolitanus secured Africa the agricultural base of the empire where he was born.96 His victory over the Parthian Empire was for a time decisive securing Nisibis and Singara for the empire and establishing a status quo of Roman dominance in the region until 2
51.9 7 His policy of an expanded and betterrewarded army was criticised by his contemporaries Cassius Dio and Herodianus in particular they pointed out the increasing burden in the form of taxes and services the civilian population had to bear to maintain the new and betterpaid army.9899 The large and ongoing increase in military expenditure caused problems for all of his successors.90 To maintain his enlarged military he debased the Roman currency. Upon his accession he decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 
81.5  to 
78.5  although the silver weight actually increased rising from 
2.4 0 grams to 
2.4 6 grams. Nevertheless the following year he debased the denarius again because of rising military expenditures. The silver purity decreased from 
78.5  to 
64.5 the silver weight dropping from 
2.4 6 grams to 
1.9 8 grams. In 196 he reduced the purity and silver weight of the denarius again to 54 and 
1.8 2 grams respectively.100 Severus currency debasement was the largest since the reign of Nero compromising the longterm strength of the economy.101 Severus was also distinguished for his buildings. Apart from the triumphal arch in the Roman Forum carrying his full name he also built the Septizodium in Rome. He enriched his native city of Leptis Magna including commissioning a triumphal arch on the occasion of his visit of 2
03.5 4102 Due to Severus being born in North Africa recent years have occasionally seen him mischaracterised as racially African despite the Carthaginian and Italian antecedents of his parents. An anecdote in the Historia Augusta has Severus drive away an Ethiopian soldier who attempts to give him a garland believing the mans dark skin to be a bad omen.103 The Provinces of the Roman Empire in 210 AD Severan dynasty family treeedit v t e Severan family tree Septimius Macer Gaius Claudius Septimius Aper Fulvius Pius Lucius Septimius Severus Publius Septimius Aper Gaius Septimius Aper Fulvia Pia Publius Septimius Geta Septimia Polla Julius Bassianus Septimius Publius Septimius Geta Septimia Octavilla Paccia Marciana 1 Septimius Severus r.1932
