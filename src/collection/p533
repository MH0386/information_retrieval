27 th century BC was an Egyptian chancellor to the Pharaoh Djoser possible architect of Djosers step pyramid and high priest of the sun god Ra at Heliopolis. Very little is known of Imhotep as a historical figure but in the 3000 years following his death he was gradually glorified and deified. Traditions from long after Imhoteps death treated him as a great author of wisdom texts3 and especially as a physician.45678 No text from his lifetime mentions these capacities and no text mentions his name in the first 1200 years following his death.910 Apart from the three short contemporary inscriptions that establish him as chancellor to the Pharaoh the first text to reference Imhotep dates to the time of Amenhotep III c.13911353 BC. It is addressed to the owner of a tomb and reads The wabpriest may give offerings to your ka. The wabpriests may stretch to you their arms with libations on the soil as it is done for Imhotep with the remains of the water bowl. Wildung 19773 It appears that this libation to Imhotep was done regularly as they are attested on papyri associated with statues of Imhotep until the Late Period c.664332 BC. Wildung 19773 explains the origin of this cult as a slow evolution of intellectuals memory of Imhotep from his death onward. Gardiner finds the cult of Imhotep during the New Kingdom c.15501077 BC sufficiently distinct from the usual offerings made to other commoners that the epithet demigod is likely justified to describe his veneration.11 The first references to the healing abilities of Imhotep occur from the Thirtieth Dynasty c.380343 BC onward some 2200 years after his death.10127344 Imhotep is among the few nonroyal Egyptians who were deified after their deaths and until the 
21 st centuryclarification needed he was one of nearly a dozen nonroyals to achieve this status.1213 The center of his cult was in Memphis. The location of his tomb remains unknown despite efforts to find it.14 The consensus is citation neededthat it is hidden somewhere at Saqqara. Historicityedit Imhoteps historicity is confirmed by two contemporary inscriptions made during his lifetime on the base or pedestal of one of Djosers statues Cairo JE 49889 and also by a graffito on the enclosure wall surrounding Sekhemkhets unfinished step pyramid.1516 The latter inscription suggests that Imhotep outlived Djoser by a few years and went on to serve in the construction of Pharaoh Sekhemkhets pyramid which was abandoned due to this rulers brief reign.15 Architecture and engineeringedit The step pyramid of Djoser Imhotep was one of the chief officials of the Pharaoh Djoser. Concurring with much later legends Egyptologists credit him with the design and construction of the Pyramid of Djoser a step pyramid at Saqqara built during the 
3 rd Dynasty.17 He may also have been responsible for the first known use of stone columns to support a building.18 Despite these later attestations the pharaonic Egyptians themselves never credited Imhotep as the designer of the stepped pyramid nor with the invention of stone architecture.19 Deificationedit God of medicineedit Two thousand years after his death Imhoteps status had risen to that of a god of medicine and healing. Eventually Imhotep was equated with Thoth the god of architecture mathematics and medicine and patron of scribes Imhoteps cult was merged with that of his own former tutelary god. He was revered in the region of Thebes as the brother of Amenhotep son of Hapu  another deified architect  in the temples dedicated to Thoth.20
21 v3 p104 Because of his association with health the Greeks equated Imhotep with Asklepios their own god of health who also was a deified mortal.22 According to myth Imhoteps mother was a mortal named Khereduankh she too being eventually revered as a demigoddess as the daughter of Banebdjedet.23 Alternatively since Imhotep was known as the Son of Ptah

PostAlexander periodedit The Upper Egyptian Famine Stela which dates from the Ptolemaic period 30530 BC bears an inscription containing a legend about a famine lasting seven years during the reign of Djoser. Imhotep is credited with having been instrumental in ending it. One of his priests explained the connection between the god Khnum and the rise of the Nile to the Pharaoh who then had a dream in which the Nile god spoke to him promising to end the drought.24 A demotic papyrus from the temple of Tebtunis dating to the 
2 nd century AD preserves a long story about Imhotep.25 The Pharaoh Djoser plays a prominent role in the story which also mentions Imhoteps family his father the god Ptah his mother Khereduankh and his younger sister Renpetneferet. At one point Djoser desires Renpetneferet and Imhotep disguises himself and tries to rescue her. The text also refers to the royal tomb of Djoser. Part of the legend includes an anachronistic battle between the Old Kingdom and the Assyrian armies where Imhotep fights an Assyrian sorceress in a duel of magic.26 As an instigator of Egyptian culture Imhoteps idealized image lasted well into the Roman period. In the Ptolemaic period the Egyptian priest and historian Manetho credited him with inventing the method of a stonedressed building during Djosers reign although he was not the first to actually build with stone. Stonewalling flooring lintels and jambs had appeared sporadically during the Archaic Period even though it is true that a building the size of the step pyramid made entirely out of stone had never before been constructed. Before Djoser Pharaohs were buried in mastaba tombs. Medicineedit Egyptologist James Peter Allen states that The Greeks equated him with their own god of medicine Asklepios although ironically there is no evidence that Imhotep himself was a physician.27 In his Pulitzerprize winning biography of cancer  The Emperor of All Maladies  Siddhartha Mukherjee cites the oldest identified written diagnosis of cancer to Imhotep.28 Unfortunately the therapy Imhotep laconically prescribed for it would be equally recognizable for millennia There is none. In popular cultureedit Ernest Board An invocation to Iemhetep the Egyptian deity of medicine c.1912 Imhotep is the antagonistic title character of Universals 1932 film The Mummy29 its 1999 remake and that films 2001 sequel.30 Imhotep was also portrayed in the television show Stargate SG1 as being a false god and an alien known as a Goauld.citation needed Imhotep was portrayed as the protagonist of the Japanese manga series Im Great Priest Imhotep written and illustrated by Makoto Morishita. Imhotep can be recruited as a Great Engineer in Civilization VI.
