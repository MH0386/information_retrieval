17 th century BCE. His royal name Seuserenre translates as The one whom Re has caused to be strong.6 Khyan bears the titles of an Egyptian king but also the title ruler of the foreign land heqakhaset. The later title is the typical designation of the Hyksos rulers. Khyan is one of the better attested kings from the Hyksos period known from many seals and seal impressions. Remarkable are objects with his name found at Knossos and Hattusha indicating diplomatic contacts with Crete and the Hittites. A sphinx with his name was bought on the art market at Baghdad and might demonstrate diplomatic contacts to Babylon in an example of EgyptMesopotamia relations.78 Hyksos Kingdomedit Khyans seat of power was located in Avaris which hosted a strongly fortified palace.9 Seal impressions of Khyan and a stela of his eldest son prince Yanassi1011 were found in two areas of the city during excavations confirming his presence onsite.12 The palace possibly destroyed during the later conquest of the Hyksos kingdom by the Thebans under Ahmose Inote 2 comprised a high platform built on massive brick casemates surrounded by columned halls and monumental staircases leading to a still higher platform on which the royal apartments probably stood.9 This palace seems to have been abandoned c. 1600 BC at which point an enormous ritual feast was orchestrated filling several 5 m 16 ft wide pits with animal bones and thousands of pottery fragments in consequence. Some of these fragments came from an array of vessels produced by the Kerma culture a Nubian kingdom and Hyksos ally during the Second Intermediate Period.14 The Egyptologist Manfred Bietak proposes that the ritual feast and abandonment of the palace were triggered by the death of its owner15 most probably Khyan.1617 On the western edge of Avaris another fortress was subsequently erected in the later Hyksos period c. 15601530 BC likely under Khyans successor Apepi.15 East of Avaris the Hyksos controlled the massive 350 m  400 m 1150 ft  1310 ft fortress of Tjaru on the road to Sinai and Canaan where stelae of the Hyksos king Apepi were uncovered.18 According to Manfred Bietak Khyans rule marks the peak of the Hyksos kingdom power.19 In this view Khyan directly ruled over Lower and Middle Egypt up to Cusae and indirectly dominated the Nile Valley as far south as Thebes20 forcing native Egyptian kingdoms including those of the 
16 th and Abydos Dynasty into vassal states.21 At the time of Khyan relations between the Hyksos and their Egyptian vassals were likely peaceful centered on exchange and trade and possibly even including donations to Upper Egyptian sanctuaries such as one in Gebelein were blocks inscribed with Khyans name were uncovered.22 All of this is contested however. For Alexander IlinTomich the territory directly ruled by the Hyksos kings of Avaris was likely confined to the eastern Delta and the nature and extent of their control over Middle Egypt remains unclear.23 Khyans position in the Hyksos dynastyedit Scarab of Khyan24 Scarab of Khyan the Hyksos Hyksos highlighted Khyan is identified with king Iannas in the works of Josephus whose knowledge of the Hyksos Pharaohs was derived from a history of Egypt written by Manetho. Josephus mentions him after Apophis when discussing the reign lengths of kings who ruled after Salitis. This led 
18 th century scholars such as Arthur Bedford to place Khyan after Apophis towards the end of the Hyksos dynasty. However in Sextus Julius Africanus version of Manethos Epitome Khyan whose name is transcribed there as Staan is listed after a king Pachnan perhaps YaqubHar. Nonetheless the hypothesis of a temporal proximity between kings Khyan and Apepi is now commonly accepted though questionable and contested.232526 Stylistically Khyans scarabs resemble closely those of YaqubHar who might date rather to the beginning and not to the end of the Hyksosperiod.2728 This indicates that Khyan was one of the earlier rulers of the 
15 th dynasty. The early position of Khyan within the 
15 th dynasty may be confirmed by new archaeological finds at Edfu. On this site were found seal impressions of Khyan in close connection with seal impressions of the 
13 th Dynasty king Sobekhotep IV indicating that both kings could have reigned at about the same time.29 The scholars Moeller and Marouard discuss the discovery of an important early 
12 th dynasty Middle Kingdom administrative building in the eastern Tell Edfu area which was continuously employed into the early Second Intermediate Period before it fell out of use during the 
17 th dynasty when its remains were sealed by a large silo court. Fieldwork by Egyptologists in 2010 and 2011 into the remains of the former 
12 th dynasty building which was also used in the 
13 th dynasty led to the discovery of a large adjoining hall which proved to contain 41 sealings showing the cartouche of the Hyksos ruler Khyan together with 9 sealings naming the 
13 th dynasty king Sobekhotep IV. As Moeller and Marouard write These finds come from a secure and sealed archaeological context and open up new questions about the cultural and chronological evolution of the late Middle Kingdom and early Second Intermediate Period.30 These conclusions are rejected by Robert Porter who argues that Khyan ruled much later than Sobekhotep IV and that the seals of a pharaoh were used even long after his death. Another option he proposed is that Sobekhotep IV reigned much later than previously thought.31 Lion inscribed with the cartouche of Khyan found in Baghdad suggesting relations with Babylon.

87.3 278 Blue glazed steatite scarab in a gold mount with the cartouche of Khyan  Son of Ra Khyan living forever Nearly all carbon14 analyses of materials related to the Second Intermediate Period yield dates on average 120 years earlier than was expected from the prevailing chronological reconstruction of the 
15 th Dynasty. While the debate is ongoing Egyptologists have acknowledged the validity of these observations and that they indicate some major issue with the consensus reached hitherto. Khyans rule is no longer dated with any accuracy. The Egyptologist David Aston has showed available evidence is compatible with Khyan ruling anywhere between 1700 BC and 1580 BC with the former his preferred scenario.3 The possibility that one or more kings reigned between him and Apophis is now the dominant hypothesis. A stela of Khyan mentioning a kings son was also discovered at Avaris. Manfred Bietak observed that a stela set up in Avaris contains the nomen and prenomen of Khyan and a now lost dedication presumably to Seth Lord of Avaris below which are inscribed the title and name of the Eldest Kings Son Yanassi.3334 The Danish Egyptologist Kim Ryholt who published an extensive catalogue of the monuments of all the numerous pharaohs of the Second Intermediate Period notes an important personal detail regarding this kings family Ryholt writes that the association of Khyan with those of his eldest son upon this stela suggests that Yanassi in fact was his designated successor as also implied by his title. Ryholt speculates that Manetho might have mentioned Yanassi in a now lost passage and that one possible explanation of the name Iannas used by Josephus for Khyan is a misquotation of such a passage in which the sons name was extracted instead of the fathers.34 Origin of Khyans nameedit Ryholt notes that the name Khyan generally has been interpreted as Amorite Hayanu reading hyaan which the Egyptian form represents perfectly and this is in all likelihood the correct interpretation.35 It should be stressed that Khyans name was not original and had been in use for centuries before the fifteenth Hyksos Dynasty. The name Hayanu is recorded in the Assyrian king listssee Khorsabad List I 17 and the SDAS List I 
16 for a remote ancestor of ShamshiAdad I c.1800 BC.35 Notesedit  Dates proposed for Khyans reign c. 170016691667 BC4 16531614 BC5 16101580 BC  The palace was decorated with painted murals in Cretan styles and motifs. Initially the palace excavator Manfred Bietak saw this as suggestion of farreaching cultural and commercial exchanges under the Hyksos. He later reappraised the dating of the murals proposing instead that they date to the early 
18 th Dynasty of Egypt under Hatshepsut or Thutmose III.13 Referencesedit  The name of Khyan on the statue from Bubastis is written over an erasure that the statue is of the XIIth Dynasty and that Khyan was a Hykss king in Griffith F.
