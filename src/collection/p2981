Ptolemy was basileus and pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt from 305304 BC to his death3 during which time Egypt became a thriving bastion of Hellenistic civilization and Alexandria a great seat of Greek culture. Ptolemy I was the son of Arsinoe of Macedon by either her husband Lagus or Philip II of Macedon the father of Alexander. However the latter is unlikely and may be a myth fabricated to glorify the Ptolemaic Dynasty.4 Ptolemy was one of Alexanders most trusted companions and military officers. After the death of Alexander in 323 BC Ptolemy retrieved his body as it was en route to be buried in Macedon placing it in Memphis instead where it was later moved to Alexandria in a new tomb. Afterwards he joined a coalition against Perdiccas the royal regent over Philip III of Macedon. The latter invaded Egypt but was assassinated by his own officers in 320 BC allowing Ptolemy I to consolidate his control over the country. After a series of wars between Alexanders successors Ptolemy gained a claim to Judea in southern Syria which was disputed with the Seleukid king Seleucus I. He also took control of Cyprus and Cyrenaica the latter of which was placed under the control of Ptolemys stepson Magas. Ptolemy also had the Library of Alexandria built. Ptolemy I may have married Thas his mistress during the life of Alexander he is known to have married the Persian noblewoman Artakama on Alexanders orders. He later married Eurydice daughter of the Macedonian regent Antipater their sons Ptolemy Keraunos and Meleager ruled in turn as kings of Macedon. Ptolemys final marriage was to Eurydices cousin and ladyinwaiting Berenice I. Ptolemy I died in 282 BC and was succeeded by his son with Berenice Ptolemy II. Early life and careeredit Ptolemaic coin showing Alexander the Great wearing an elephant scalp a symbol of his conquest in India A Greek Macedonian2 Ptolemy was born in 367 BC.5 Ptolemys mother was Arsinoe. According to Satyrus the Peripatetic Arsinoe was a descendant of Alexander I of Macedon and thus a member of the Argead dynasty claiming ultimate descent from Heracles. Ostensibly Ptolemys father was Lagus a Macedonian nobleman from Eordaea but many ancient sources claim that he was actually an illegitimate son of Philip II of Macedon. If true this would have made Ptolemy the halfbrother of Alexander the Great. It is probable that this is a later myth fabricated to glorify the Ptolemaic dynasty.6 However Ptolemy may have been a greatgrandson of Amyntas I of Macedon making him a member of the Argead royal house and a distant relative of Alexander the Great who was a greatgreatgrandson of Amyntas.78 Ptolemy served with Alexander from his first campaigns and was among the seven somatophylakes bodyguards of Alexander. He played a principal part in the later campaigns in Afghanistan and India.9 He participated in the Battle of Issus commanding troops on the left wing under the authority of Parmenion. Later he accompanied Alexander during his journey to the Oracle in the Siwa Oasis where he was proclaimed a son of Zeus.10 Ptolemy had his first independent command during the campaign against the rebel Bessus whom his own guards captured and handed over to Ptolemy who then handed him over to Alexander for execution.11 Successor of Alexanderedit Coin of Ptolemy I British Museum London Ptolemy I gold stater with elephant quadriga Cyrenaica Ptolemy as Pharaoh in the British Museum When Alexander died in 323 BC Ptolemy is said to have instigated the settlement of the empire made at Babylon. Through the Partition of Babylon he was appointed satrap of Egypt under the nominal kings Philip III and the infant Alexander IV the former satrap the Greek Cleomenes stayed on as his deputy. Ptolemy quickly moved without authorization to subjugate Cyrenaica.9 By custom kings in Macedonia asserted their right to the throne by burying their predecessor. Probably because he wanted to preempt Perdiccas the imperial regent from staking his claim in this way Ptolemy took great pains in acquiring the body of Alexander the Great. On his deathbed Alexander wished to be buried at the Temple of Zeus Ammon in the Siwa Oasis of ancient Libya instead of the royal tombs of Aigai in Macedon.12 However his successors including Perdiccas attempted to bury his body in Macedon instead. In late 322 or early 321 BC Alexanders body was in Syria on its way to Macedon when it was captured by Ptolemy I. He brought Alexanders remains back to Egypt interring them at Memphis but they were later moved to Alexandria where a tomb was constructed for them.13 Shortly after this event Ptolemy openly joined the coalition against Perdiccas. Perdiccas appears to have suspected Ptolemy of aiming for the throne himself and may have decided that Ptolemy was his most dangerous rival. Ptolemy executed Cleomenes for spying on behalf of Perdiccas this removed the chief check on his authority and allowed Ptolemy to obtain the huge sum that Cleomenes had accumulated.14 Rivalry and warsedit Kingdom of Ptolemy I Kingdom of Cassander Kingdom of Lysimachus Kingdom of Seleucus I Epirus Other Carthage Rome Greek colonies Relief from the cult chamber of Thoth in Tuna elGebel painted limestone reign of Ptolemy I Soter ca. 295 BC Ptolemy I Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek Copenhagen In 321 BC Perdiccas attempted to invade Egypt only to fall at the hands of his own men.15 Ptolemys decision to defend the Nile against Perdiccas ended in fiasco for Perdiccas with the loss of 2000 men. This failure was a fatal blow to Perdiccas reputation and he was murdered in his tent by two of his subordinates. Ptolemy immediately crossed the Nile to provide supplies to what had the day before been an enemy army. Ptolemy was offered the regency in place of Perdiccas but he declined.16 Ptolemy was consistent in his policy of securing a power base while never succumbing to the temptation of risking all to succeed Alexander.17 In the long wars that followed between the different Diadochi Ptolemys first goal was to hold Egypt securely and his second was to secure control in the outlying areas Cyrenaica and Cyprus as well as Syria including the province of Judea. His first occupation of Syria was in 318 and he established at the same time a protectorate over the petty kings of Cyprus. When Antigonus I master of Asia in 315 showed expansionist ambitions Ptolemy joined the coalition against him and on the outbreak of war evacuated Syria. In Cyprus he fought the partisans of Antigonus and reconquered the island 313. A revolt in Cyrene was crushed the same year.9 In 312 Ptolemy and Seleucus the fugitive satrap of Babylonia both invaded Syria and defeated Demetrius I the son of Antigonus in the Battle of Gaza. Again he occupied Syria and againafter only a few months when Demetrius had won a battle over his general and Antigonus entered Syria in forcehe evacuated it. In 311 a peace was concluded between the combatants. Soon after this the surviving 
13 yearold king Alexander IV was murdered in Macedonia on the orders of Cassander leaving the satrap of Egypt absolutely his own master.9 The peace did not last long early in 310 he was informed that his ally Nicocles of Paphos was planning to defect to Antigonus he sent some agents who together with his brother Menelaus who was still on Cyprus with an army dealt with the situation they surrounded Nicocles palace and forced him to commit suicide.18 In 309 Ptolemy personally commanded a fleet which detached the coastal towns of Phaselis Xanthos Kaunos Iasos and Myndus in Lycia and Caria from Antigonus then crossed into Greece where he took possession of Corinth Sicyon and Megara 308 BC. In 306 a great fleet under Demetrius attacked Cyprus and Ptolemys brother Menelaus was defeated and captured in another decisive Battle of Salamis. Ptolemys complete loss of Cyprus followed.9 The satraps Antigonus and Demetrius now each assumed the title of king Ptolemy as well as Cassander Lysimachus and Seleucus I Nicator responded by doing the same. In the winter of 306 BC Antigonus tried to follow up his victory in Cyprus by invading Egypt but Ptolemy was strongest there and successfully held the frontier against him. Ptolemy led no further overseas expeditions against Antigonus.19 However he did send great assistance to Rhodes when it was besieged by Demetrius 305304. The Rhodians granted divine honors to Ptolemy as a result of the lifting of the siege.20 When the coalition against Antigonus was renewed in 302 Ptolemy joined it and invaded Syria a third time while Antigonus was engaged with Lysimachus in Asia Minor. On hearing a report that Antigonus had won a decisive victory there he once again evacuated Syria. But when the news came that Antigonus had been defeated and slain by Lysimachus and Seleucus at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 he occupied Syria a fourth time.19 The other members of the coalition had assigned all Syria to Seleucus after what they regarded as Ptolemys desertion and for the next hundred years the question of the ownership of southern Syria i.e. Judea produced recurring warfare between the Seleucid and Ptolemaic dynasties. Henceforth Ptolemy seems to have involved himself as little as possible in the rivalries between Asia Minor and Greece he lost what he held in Greece but reconquered Cyprus in 295294. Cyrenaica after a series of rebellions was finally subjugated in about 300 and placed under his stepson Magas.19 Marriages children and successionedit Coin of Ptolemy I and Berenice I Depiction of Ptolemy I or II Royal Ontario Museum Ptolemy I depicted as Dionysus While Alexander was alive Ptolemy had three children with his mistress Thas who may also have been his wife Lagus Leontiscus and Eirene who was given in marriage to Eunostos of Soloi in Cyprus. During the Susa weddings Ptolemy married Persian noblewoman Artakama as ordered by Alexander the Great.21 Around 322 BC he married Eurydice daughter of Antipater regent of Macedonia. They had five children before she was repudiated three sonsPtolemy Ceraunus king of Macedon from 281 BC to 279 BC his brother and successor Meleager who ruled for two months in 279 BC and a rebel in Cyprus who was put to death by his halfbrother Ptolemy IIas well as the daughters Ptolemais who married Demetrius I of Macedon and Lysandra first married to Alexander V of Macedon and after to Lysimachus son Agathocles.212223242526 Ptolemy married once more to Berenice Eurydices cousin who had come to Egypt as Eurydices ladyinwaiting with the children from her first marriage to Philip. Their children were Arsinoe II Philotera and Ptolemy II. Their eldest child Arsinoe married Lysimachus then her halfbrother Ptolemy Keraunos and finally her full brother Ptolemy II.2227 In 285 Ptolemy made his son Ptolemy II his coregent. His eldest legitimate son Ptolemy Keraunos fled to the court of Lysimachus. Ptolemy I died in January 282 aged 84 or 
85.5  Shrewd and cautious he had a compact and wellordered realm to show at the end of forty years of war. His reputation for good nature and liberality attached the floating soldierclass of Macedonians and other Greeks to his service and was not insignificant nor did he wholly neglect conciliation of the natives. He was a ready patron of letters founding the Great Library of Alexandria.28 The Ptolemaic dynasty which he founded ruled Egypt for nearly three hundred years. It was a Hellenistic kingdom known for its capital Alexandria which became a center of Greek culture. Ptolemaic rule ended with the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 BC.29 Historianedit Ptolemy himself wrote an eyewitness history of Alexanders campaigns now lost.30 In the second century AD Ptolemys history was used by Arrian of Nicomedia as one of his two main primary sources alongside the history of Aristobulus of Cassandreia for his own extant Anabasis of Alexander and hence large parts of Ptolemys history can be assumed to survive in paraphrase or prcis in Arrians work.31 Arrian cites Ptolemy by name on only a few occasions but it is likely that large stretches of Arrians Anabasis reflect Ptolemys version of events. Arrian once names Ptolemy as the author whom I chiefly follow32 and in his Preface writes that Ptolemy seemed to him to be a particularly trustworthy source not only because he was present with Alexander on campaign but also because he was himself a king and hence lying would be more dishonourable for him than for anyone else.33 Ptolemys lost history was long considered an objective work distinguished by its straightforward honesty and sobriety19 but more recent work has called this assessment into question. R. M. Errington argued that Ptolemys history was characterised by persistent bias and selfaggrandisement and by systematic blackening of the reputation of Perdiccas one of Ptolemys chief dynastic rivals after Alexanders death.34 For example Arrians account of the fall of Thebes in 335 BC Anabasis 

1.8.1 

1.8.8  a rare section of narrative explicitly attributed to Ptolemy by Arrian shows several significant variations from the parallel account preserved in Diodorus Siculus 
17.1 112 most notably in attributing a distinctly unheroic role in proceedings to Perdiccas. More recently J. Roisman has argued that the case for Ptolemys blackening of Perdiccas and others has been much exaggerated.35 Euclidedit Ptolemy personally sponsored the great mathematician Euclid. He found Euclids seminal work the Elements too difficult to study so he asked if there were an easier way to master it. According to Proclus Euclid famously quipped Sire there is no Royal Road to geometry.36 In art and fictionedit Ptolemy is portrayed by Anthony Hopkins and Elliot Cowan as the narrator and a main character in the historical epic Alexander directed by Oliver Stone. Ptolemy appears as a minor character in Mary Renaults Alexander Trilogy novels. Ptolemy appears as a character in the mobile game Fate Grand Order as an Archer Class Servant. Ptolemy is portrayed by Dino Kelly as a recurring character in Netflixs 2024 drama docuseries Alexander The Making of a God.
