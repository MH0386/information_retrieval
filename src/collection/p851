31.2 3111 Itjtawy or ItTowy2 Seizer of the Two Lands also known by its full name Amenemhatitjtawy Amenemhat seizes the Two Lands was an ancient Egyptian royal city established by pharaoh Amenemhat I.3266 As yet Itjtawys exact location remains unidentified. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the site lies beneath cultivated fields east of the pyramids of Amenemhat I and Senusret I at Lisht.3266 There is evidence that Amenemhat the founder of the 
12 th Dynasty who ruled approximately 1991 to 1962 BC established Itjtawy during his regnal year 20 replacing Thebes as the capital of Egypt.1 However the earliest known mention of Itjtawy is dated to the pharaohs regnal year 30 ten years later its presumed foundation and is represented by the doubledated stela CG 20516 now in Cairo Museum.12 Relocation of the capital may have been a strategic move. The site for Itjtawy  hundreds of miles down the Nile from Thebes  may have been chosen for its proximity to the source of Asiatic incursions into Egypt in order to help prevent further attacks.4 The name of Itjtawy as it appears on the aforementioned stele surrounded by a fortified enclosure Since the determinative sign for Itjtawy is that of a fortified enclosure instead of the conventional city hieroglyph Egyptologist Steven Snape suggested that Itjtawy was a disembedded capital a small center comprising administrative buildings and a royal residence inhabited only by the administrative staff who ran those buildings the major economic and cultural centers remained preexisting cities such as Memphis and Thebes.3266 Itjtawy retained its capital status during the 
12 th Dynasty and well into the 
13 th Dynasty at least until the rule of Merneferre Ay the last pharaoh of the dynasty who is attested by objects from outside of Upper Egypt. It is believed that at this point the invasion of Lower Egypt by populations from Canaan occurred which led to the fall of the Middle Kingdom into the Second Intermediate Period the pharaohs of the 
13 th Dynasty thus abandoned Itjtawy and retreated back to Thebes in the south.591 See alsoedit List of ancient Egyptian towns and cities Referencesedit  a b c Arnold Dorothea 1991.
