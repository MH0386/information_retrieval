13 th Dynasty Merneferre Ay also spelled Aya or Eje sometimes known as Ay I was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the mid 
13 th Dynasty. The longest reigning pharaoh of the 
13 th Dynasty he ruled a likely fragmented Egypt for over 23 years in the early to mid 
17 th century BC. A pyramidion bearing his name shows that he possibly completed a pyramid probably located in the necropolis of Memphis. Merneferre Ay is the last pharaoh of the 
13 th Dynasty to be attested outside Upper Egypt. In spite of his long reign the number of artefacts attributable to him is comparatively small. This may point to problems in Egypt at the time and indeed by the end of his reign the administration of the Egyptian state seems to have completely collapsed.13 It is possible that the capital of Egypt since the early Middle Kingdom Itjtawy was abandoned during or shortly after Ays reign. For this reason some scholars consider Merneferre Ay to be the last pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. Chronologyedit Chronological positionedit Globular jar of Merneferre Ay Metropolitan Museum of Art The relative chronological position of Merneferre Ay as a king of the mid 
13 th Dynasty is well established by the Turin canon a king list redacted during the early Ramesside period 12921069 BC and which serves as the primary historical source for the Second Intermediate Period. The king list records Ays name on column 8 line 3 column 6 line 3 in Alan Gardiners reading of the Turin canon and entry 
7.3  in von Beckeraths reading and establishes that Merneferre Ay was preceded by Wahibre Ibiau and succeeded by Merhotepre Ini who was possibly his son.1 The precise chronological placement of Merneferre Ay varies between scholars with Jrgen von Beckerath and Aidan Dodson seeing him as the 
27 th king of the dynasty4 while Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker place him in the 
32 nd and 
33 rd positions respectively.15 Similarly the absolute datation of Ays reign is debated and varies by 17 years between Ryholts 17011677 BC1 and Schneiders 16841661 BC.3 Reign lengthedit Until recently the duration of Merneferre Ays reign which is recorded in the Turin canon was disputed by Jrgen von Beckerath who read the damaged figure on the papyrus fragment as 13 years6 while both Alan Gardiner and Kenneth Kitchen maintained it should be read as 23 years.78 The dispute was settled in the latest study of the Turin canon by Kim Ryholt who confirms that Merneferre Ays reign length as recorded on the papyrus is 23 years 8 months and 18 days.1 Ryholt insists that the tick that distinguishes 20 and 30 from 10 is preserved and beyond dispute. Accordingly 23 years or less likely 33 years must be read.1 This makes Merneferre Ay the longestruling pharaoh of the 
13 th Dynasty at a time when numerous shortlived kings ruled Egypt. Reign and attestationsedit Green glazed steatite scarab of Merneferre Ay British Museum.9 As a king of the mid 
13 th Dynasty Merneferre Ay reigned over Middle and Upper Egypt concurrently with the 
14 th Dynasty which controlled at least the Eastern Nile Delta. The egyptologists Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker contend that Mernferre usurped the throne at the expense of his predecessor Wahibre Ibiau.15 They base this conclusion on the total absence of filiative nomina that is references to the name of his father on the artefacts attributable to him.1 They believe that this should have been the case had his father been a pharaoh and indeed a number of 
13 th Dynasty kings used filiative nomina. Little is known of Ays consorts he was possibly married to Ineni whose scarabs are stylistically similar to those of Ay.1 Attestationsedit Merneferre Ay is well attested no fewer than 62 scarab seals and one cylinderseal10 bearing his name are known 51 of which are of unknown provenance51112 Among the scarabs of known provenance three are from Lower Egypt more precisely one from Bubastis and two from Heliopolis.15 The rest of the scarabs of known provenance are from Abydos Coptos and Lisht all localities being in Middle or Upper Egypt. Other attestations of Ay include an obsidian globular jar now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art13 a ball dedicated to Sobek14 an inscribed limestone block part of a lintel discovered in 1908 by Georges Legrain in Karnak and a pyramidion.51516 The pyramidion was confiscated from robbers by the Egyptian police in 1911 at Faqus close to the ancient city of Avaris. It is carved with the name of Ay and shows him offering to Horus Lord of heaven demonstrating that a pyramid was built for him during his long reign.1617 The fact that the pyramidion was probably discovered by the robbers in modernday Khatana part of the ancient city of Avaris modernday Qantir is important since it was likely the capital of the 
14 th Dynasty during Ays lifetime. Egyptologists believe that the pyramidion originates in fact from Memphis in the necropolis of which Ays pyramid must be located. Accordingly this suggests that the pyramid was looted at the time of the Hyksos invasion c. 1650 BC and the pyramidion taken to Avaris at this moment.15 This is vindicated by the damaged text on the pyramidion which originally invoked four gods two of whom were Ptah and ReHorus for RaHorakhty. The cults of these gods were based in the Memphite necropolis not in Avaris.1 Other objects which suffered the same fate include two colossal statues of the 
13 th Dynasty king Imyremeshaw. Legacyedit Lintel of Merneferre Ay.15 Even though Merneferre Ay is well attested the number of objects attributable to him is relatively small given his nearly 24 yearlong reign.5 This may point to serious problems in Egypt at the time and indeed Ryholt and others believe that by the end of Ays reign the administration of the Egyptian state seems to have completely collapsed.1 Merneferre Ay is the last Egyptian king of the 
13 th Dynasty who is attested by objects from outside of Upper Egypt.3 This may indicate the abandonment of the old capital of the Middle Kingdom Itjtawy in favor of Thebes.18 Daphna Ben Tor believes that this event was triggered by the invasion of the eastern Delta and the Memphite region by Canaanite rulers. Indeed some egyptologists believe that by the end of Ays reign the 
13 th dynasty had lost control of Lower Egypt including the Delta region and possibly Memphis itself. For these authors this marks the end of the Middle Kingdom and the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period.18 This analysis is rejected by Ryholt and Baker however who note that the stele of Seheqenre Sankhptahi reigning toward the very end of the 
13 th Dynasty strongly suggests that he reigned over Memphis. Unfortunately the stele is of unknown provenance.15 See alsoedit Wikimedia Commons has media related to Merneferre Ay.
