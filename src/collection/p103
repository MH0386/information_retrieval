Many Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth Dynasties in the Old Kingdom as a continuation of the administration centralised at Memphis. The Old Kingdom was followed by a period of disunity and relative cultural decline referred to by Egyptologists as the First Intermediate Period  or as the Egyptians called it the first illness. The royal capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom was located at Memphis where Djoser established his court. The Old Kingdom is perhaps best known however for the large number of pyramids which were constructed at this time as pharaonic burial places. For this reason the Old Kingdom is frequently referred to as the Age of the Pyramids. Third Dynasty  The Third Dynasty ruled from 2686 to 2613 BC.

Nomen Praenomen Comments Dates Sneferu Built the Bent Pyramid which is a pyramid built at a normal angle at the bottom but drastically changes at the top. He also built the first true pyramid known as the Red Pyramid. Some say that he was buried at the Red Pyramid while others say that he was buried at the Bent Pyramid. Bones have been found at the Red Pyramid but there is no evidence that this is Sneferus body. 26132589 Khufu Greek form Cheops. Built the great pyramid of Giza. Note that Khufu is spoken of in early sources as being third of his family to rule although there is no known record of a Pharaoh between Sneferu and Khufu. One supposition is that there might have been a very short reign of some elder brother of Khufu whose inscriptions name and monuments have perished for one reason or another. 25892566 Djedefra Radjedef Believed to have created the Sphinx at Giza as a monument for his deceased father. He also created a pyramid at Abu Rawash however this pyramid is no longer intact as it is believed the Romans recycled the materials it was made from. Before being demolished by the Romans according to a documentary aired by the History Channel the pyramid may actually have been the highest ever built about 20 meters taller than the Great Pyramid of Giza although this is due to its elevated location rather than the size from base to tip. 25662558 Khafra Greek form Chephren His pyramid is the second largest in Giza. 25582532  here some authorities insert Bikheris following Manetho  Menkaura Greek form Mycerinus.

The Old Kingdom rapidly collapsed after the death of Pepi II. He had reigned for 94 years longer than any monarch in history and died aged 100. The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age. The Union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine. Around 2160 BC a new line of pharaohs tried to reunite Lower Egypt from their capital in Herakleopolis Magna. In the meantime however a rival line based at Thebes was reuniting Upper Egypt and a clash between the two rival dynasties was inevitable. Around 2055 BC a descendant of the pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs reunited the Two Lands founded the Eleventh Dynasty and ruled as Mentuhotep II the first pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom. Seventh and Eighth Dynasties combined  The Seventh and Eighth Dynasties ruled from 2181 to 2160 BC.

In addition to the Twelfth Dynasty some scholars include the Eleventh Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dynasties in the Middle Kingdom. The Middle Kingdom can be noted for the expansion of trade outside of the kingdom that occurred during this time. This opening of trade eventually led to the downfall of the Middle Kingdom induced by an invasion from the Hyksos.

It is best known as when the Hyksos made their appearance in Egypt whose reign comprised the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Dynasties. The Thirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the Twelfth Dynasty and was unable to hold onto the long land of Egypt. The provincial ruling family in Xois located in the marshes of the western Delta broke away from the central authority to form the Fourteenth Dynasty. The Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of Sobekhotep IV and around 1720 BC took control of the town of Avaris the modern Tell edDabaKhatana. The Hyksos led by Salitis the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty overran Egypt during the reign of Dudimose I. Around the time Memphis fell to the Hyksos the native Egyptian ruling house in Thebes declared its independence and set itself up as the Seventeenth Dynasty. This dynasty eventually drove the Hyksos back into Asia Thirteenth Dynasty  The Thirteenth Dynasty following the Turin King List ruled from 1803 to around 1649 BC and lasted 153 or 154 Yrs according to Manetho.

Two of the best known pharaohs of the New Kingdom are Akhenaten also known as Amenhotep IV whose exclusive worship of the Aten is often interpreted as the first instance of monotheism and Ramesses II who attempted to recover the territories in modern IsraelPalestine Lebanon and Syria that had been held in the Eighteenth Dynasty.
