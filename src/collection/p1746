26 th dynasty Amasis II Ancient Greek  masis Phoenician  MS2 or Ahmose II was a pharaoh reigned 570  526 BCE of the Twentysixth Dynasty of Egypt the successor of Apries at Sais. He was the last great ruler of Egypt before the Persian conquest.3 Lifeedit See also Twentysixth Dynasty of Egypt family tree Most of our information about him is derived from Herodotus

61 ff and can only be imperfectly verified by monumental evidence. According to the Greek historian he was of common origins.4 He was originally an officer in the Egyptian army. His birthplace was Siuph at Sas. He took part in a general campaign of Pharaoh Psamtik II in 592 BC in Nubia.5 A revolt which broke out among native Egyptian soldiers gave him his opportunity to seize the throne. These troops returning home from a disastrous military expedition to Cyrene in Libya suspected that they had been betrayed in order that Apries the reigning king might rule more absolutely by means of his Greek mercenaries many Egyptians fully sympathized with them. General Amasis sent to meet them and quell the revolt was proclaimed king by the rebels instead and Apries who then had to rely entirely on his mercenaries was defeated6 though it is suggested that Apries had more native support than classical sources describe.7 Apries then fled to an island possibly an elevated or isolated base of Apries within Egypt89 and was killed while mounting a final insurrection against Amasis in 567 BCE with the aid of a shipped force probably Greek and maybe Carian10 while the Babylonians also invaded Egypt the same year.111213 An inscription confirms the struggle between the native Egyptian and the foreign soldiery and proves that Apries was killed and honourably buried in the fourth year of Amasis c.567 BCE.6 Amasis then married Khedebneithirbinet II one of the daughters of his predecessor Apries in order to legitimise his kingship.14 Some information is known about the family origins of Amasis his mother was a certain Tashereniset as a bust of her today located in the British Museum shows.15 A stone block from Mehallet elKubra also establishes that his maternal grandmotherTasherenisets motherwas a certain Tjenmutetj.15 His court is relatively well known. The head of the gate guard AhmosesaNeith appears on numerous monuments including the location of his sarcophagus. He was referenced on monuments of the 
30 th Dynasty and apparently had a special significance in his time. Wahibre was Leader of the southern foreigners and Head of the doors of foreigners so he was the highest official for border security. Under Amasis the career of the doctor Udjahorresnet began who was of particular importance to the Persians. Several heads of the fleet are known. Psamtek Meryneit and Pasherientaihet  Padineith are the only known viziers. Polycrates Tyrant of Samos with Pharaoh Amasis II. Herodotus describes how Amasis II would eventually cause a confrontation with the Persian armies. According to Herodotus Amasis was asked by Cambyses II or Cyrus the Great for an Egyptian ophthalmologist on good terms. Amasis seems to have complied by forcing an Egyptian physician into mandatory labor causing him to leave his family behind in Egypt and move to Persia in forced exile. In an attempt to exact revenge for this the physician grew very close to Cambyses and suggested that Cambyses should ask Amasis for a daughter in marriage in order to solidify his bonds with the Egyptians. Cambyses complied and requested a daughter of Amasis for marriage.16 Amasis worrying that his daughter would be a concubine to the Persian king refused to give up his offspring Amasis also was not willing to take on the Persian empire so he concocted a deception in which he forced the daughter of the expharaoh Apries whom Herodotus explicitly confirms to have been killed by Amasis to go to Persia instead of his own offspring.161718 This daughter of Apries was none other than Nitetis who was as per Herodotuss account tall and beautiful. Nitetis naturally betrayed Amasis and upon being greeted by the Persian king explained Amasiss trickery and her true origins. This infuriated Cambyses and he vowed to take revenge for it. Amasis died before Cambyses reached him but his heir and son Psamtik III was defeated by the Persians.1618 Herodotus also describes how just like his predecessor Amasis relied on Greek mercenaries and councilmen. One such figure was Phanes of Halicarnassus who would later leave Amasis for reasons that Herodotus does not clearly know but suspects were personal between the two figures. Amasis sent one of his eunuchs to capture Phanes but the eunuch was bested by the wise councilman and Phanes fled to Persia meeting up with Cambyses and providing advice for his invasion of Egypt. Egypt was finally lost to the Persians during the battle of Pelusium in 525 BC.18 Egypts wealthedit Statue of Tasherenese mother of king Amasis II 570526 BCE British Museum Amasis brought Egypt into closer contact with Greece than ever before. Herodotus relates that under his prudent administration Egypt reached a new level of wealth Amasis adorned the temples of Lower Egypt especially with splendid monolithic shrines and other monuments his activity here is proved by existing remains.6 For example a temple built by him was excavated at Tell Nebesha.citation needed Amasis assigned the commercial colony of Naucratis on the Canopic branch of the Nile to the Greeks and when the temple of Delphi was burnt he contributed 1000 talents to the rebuilding. He also married a Greek princess named Ladice daughter of King Battus III and made alliances with Polycrates of Samos and Croesus of Lydia.6 Montaigne cites the story by Herodotus that Ladice cured Amasis of his impotence by praying to VenusAphropdite.19 Under Amasis Egypts agricultural based economy reached its zenith. Herodotus who visited Egypt less than a century after Amasis IIs death writes that It is said that it was during the reign of Ahmose II Amasis that Egypt attained its highest level of prosperity both in respect of what the river gave the land and in respect of what the land yielded to men and that the number of inhabited cities at that time reached in total 200
00.2 0 His kingdom consisted probably of Egypt only as far as the First Cataract but to this he added Cyprus and his influence was great in Cyrene Libya.6 In his fourth year c.567 BCE Egypt was invaded by the Babylonians under the leadership of Nebuchadnezzar II.211112 It is believed that Amasis managed to repel this invasion forcing Nebuchadnezzar II to retire plans to conquer his kingdom.22 However some have suggested that Nebuchadnezzar came to defeat Apries the combined forces of Amasis and Nebuchadnezzar managing to kill him securing Amasis throne though as vassal king.2313 Amasis was later faced with another formidable enemy with the rise of Persia under Cyrus who ascended to the throne in 559 BCE his final years were preoccupied by the threat of the impending Persian onslaught against Egypt.24 With great strategic skill Cyrus had destroyed Lydia in 546 BCE and finally defeated the Babylonians in 538 BCE which left Amasis with no major Near Eastern allies to counter Persias increasing military might.24 Amasis reacted by cultivating closer ties with the Greek states to counter the future Persian invasion into Egypt but died in 526 BCE shortly before the Persians attacked.24 The final assault instead fell upon his son Psamtik III whom the Persians defeated in 525 BCE after he had reigned for only six months.25 Tomb and desecrationedit Amasis II died in 526 BC. He was buried at the royal necropolis of Sais within the temple enclosure of Neith and while his tomb has not been rediscovered Herodotus describes it for us It is a great cloistered building of stone decorated with pillars carved in the imitation of palmtrees and other costly ornaments. Within the cloister is a chamber with double doors and behind the doors stands the sepulchre.26 Herodotus also relates the desecration of Amasis mummy when the Persian king Cambyses conquered Egypt and thus ended the 
26 th Saite Dynasty No sooner did Cambyses enter the palace of Amasis that he gave orders for his Amasiss body to be taken from the tomb where it lay. This done he proceeded to have it treated with every possible indignity such as beating it with whips sticking it with goads and plucking its hairs... As the body had been embalmed and would not fall to pieces under the blows Cambyses had it burned.27 Later reputationedit This head probably came from a temple statue of Amasis II. He wears the traditional royal nemes head cloth with a protective uraeus serpent at the brow. Circa 560 BCE. Walters Art Museum Baltimore. From the fifth century BCE there is evidence of stories circulating about Amasis in Egyptian sources including a demotic papyrus of the third century BCE Herodotus Hellanikos and Plutarchs Convivium Septem Sapientium. In those tales Amasis was presented as a nonconventional Pharaoh behaving in ways unbecoming to a king but gifted with practical wisdom and cunning a trickster on the throne or a kind of comic Egyptian Solomon.28 Gallery of imagesedit Relief showing Amasis from the Karnak temple Papyrus written in demotic script in the
