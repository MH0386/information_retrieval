However the specific title was not used to address the kings of Egypt by their contemporaries until the New Kingdom of EgyptNew Kingdoms Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt
18 th Dynasty c. 1400 BC. Along with the title Pharaoh for later rulers there was an Ancient Egyptian royal titulary used by Egyptian kings which remained relatively constant during the course of Ancient Egyptian history initially featuring a Horus name a Prenomen Ancient EgyptSedge and Bee nswtbjtj name and a Two Ladies nbtj name with the additional Golden Horus nomen and prenomen titles being added successively during later dynasties.Egypt was continually governed at least in part by native pharaohs for approximately 2500 years until it was conquered by the Kingdom of Kush in the late 
8 th century BC whose rulers adopted the traditional pharaonic titulature for themselves. Following the Kushite conquest Egypt experienced another period of independent native rule before being conquered by the Achaemenid Empire whose rulers also adopted the title of Pharaoh. The last native pharaoh of Egypt was Nectanebo II who was pharaoh before the Achaemenids conquered Egypt for a second time.Achaemenid rule over Egypt came to an end through the Wars of Alexander the Greatconquests of Alexander the Great in 332 BC after which it was ruled by Ancient GreeceHellenic Pharaohs of the Ptolemaic dynastyPtolemaic Dynasty. Their rule and the independence of Egypt came to an end when Egypt became a province of Ancient RomeRome in 30 BC. Augustus and subsequent Roman emperors were Roman pharaohstyled as Pharaoh when in Egypt until the reign of Maximinus Daza in 314 AD.The dates given in this list of pharaohs are approximate.

He had reigned for more than 64 and likely up to 94 years longer than any monarch in history. The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age. The union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine.The kings of the 
7 th and 
8 th Dynasties who represented the successors of the 
6 th Dynasty tried to hold onto some power in Memphis but owed much of it to powerful nomarchs. After 20 to 45 years they were overthrown by a new line of pharaohs based in Herakleopolis Magna. Some time after these events a rival line based at Thebes EgyptThebes revolted against their nominal Northern overlords and united Upper Egypt. Around 2055 BC Mentuhotep II the son and successor of pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands thereby starting the Middle Kingdom.Seventh and Eighth DynastiesMainSeventh Dynasty of EgyptEighth Dynasty of EgyptThe Seventh Dynasty of EgyptSeventh and Eighth Dynasties ruled for approximately 2045 years. They comprise numerous ephemeral kings reigning from Memphis EgyptMemphis over a possibly divided Egypt and in any case holding only limited power owing to the effectively feudal system into which the administration had evolved.The list below is based on the Abydos King List dating to the reign of Seti I and taken from Jrgen von Beckeraths Handbuch der gyptischen Knigsnamenref namebeckJrgen von Beckerath Handbuch der gyptischen Knigsnamen Mnchner gyptologische Studien Heft 49 Mainz  P. von Zabern 1999 ISBN3805325916 httpwww.mediafire.comview

13 th Dynasty.Second Intermediate PeriodMainSecond Intermediate Period of EgyptThe Second Intermediate Period 18021550 BC is a period of disarray between the end of the Middle Kingdom of EgyptMiddle Kingdom and the start of the New Kingdom of EgyptNew Kingdom. It is best known as when the Hyksos whose reign comprised the Fifteenth dynasty of EgyptFifteenth Dynasty made their appearance in Egypt.The Thirteenth dynasty of EgyptThirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the Twelfth dynasty of EgyptTwelfth Dynasty and was unable to hold onto the two lands of Egypt. Either at the start of the dynasty c. 1805 BC or toward the middle of it in c. 1710 BC the provincial ruling family in Xois located in the marshes of the eastern Delta broke away from the central authority to form the Canaanite Fourteenth dynasty of EgyptFourteenth Dynasty.The Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of Sobekhotep IV and around 1720 BC took control of the town of Avaris the modern Tell elDabaKhatana conquering the kingdom of the 
14 th dynasty. Sometime around 1650 BC the Hyksos perhaps led by Salitis the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty conquered Memphis EgyptMemphis thereby terminating the 
13 th dynasty. The power vacuum in Upper Egypt resulting from the collapse of the 
13 th dynasty allowed the 
16 th dynasty to declare its independence in Thebes EgyptThebes only to be overrun by the Hyksos kings shortly thereafter.Subsequently as the Hyksos withdrew from Upper Egypt the native Egyptian ruling house in Thebes set itself up as the Seventeenth dynasty of EgyptSeventeenth Dynasty. This dynasty eventually drove the Hyksos back into Asia under Seqenenre Tao Kamose and finally Ahmose IAhmose first pharaoh of the New Kingdom.Thirteenth DynastyMainThirteenth Dynasty of EgyptThe Thirteenth dynasty of EgyptThirteenth Dynasty following the Turin King List ruled from 1802 to around 1649 BC and lasted 153 or 154 years according to Manetho.This table should be contrasted with Thirteenth dynasty of EgyptKnownKnown kings of the

He was the eldest son of Cleopatra VII and possibly the only son of Julius Caesar after whom he was named. Between the alleged death of Cleopatra on August 12 30 BC up to his own alleged death on August 23 30 BC he was nominally the sole pharaoh. It is tradition that he was hunted down and killed on the orders of Octavian who would become the Roman emperor Augustus but the historical evidence does not exist.citation neededdateMarch 2018 classwikitable width100 width15  ImageThrone name width15  Personal name width50  Comments width20  Dates FilePtolemy I Soter Louvre Ma849.jpg1
