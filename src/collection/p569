Named for the rusty reddish hue of its red limestone stones it is also the third largest Egyptian pyramid after those of Khufu and Khafre at Giza. It is also believed to be Egypts first successful attempt at constructing a true smoothsided pyramid. Local residents refer to the Red Pyramid as elheram elwatwaat meaning the Bat Pyramid. The Red Pyramid was not always red. It used to be cased with white Tura limestone but only a few of these stones now remain at the pyramids base at the corner. During the Middle Ages much of the white Tura limestone was taken for buildings in Cairo revealing the red limestone beneath. Historyedit Comparison of approximate profiles of the Red Pyramid with some notable pyramidal or nearpyramidal buildings. Dotted lines indicate original heights where data is available. In its SVG file hover over a pyramid to highlight and click for its article. The Red Pyramid was the third pyramid built by Old Kingdom Pharaoh Sneferu and was built 25752563 BCE. The Red Pyramid is located approximately one kilometre 
0.6 2 mi to the north of the Bent Pyramid. It is built at the same shallow 43 degree angle as the upper section of the Bent Pyramid which gives it a noticeably squat appearance compared to other Egyptian pyramids of comparable scale. Construction is believed to have begun during the thirtieth year of Sneferus reign c. 2590 BCE. Egyptologists disagree on the length of time it took to construct. Based on quarry marks found at various phases of construction Rainer Stadelmann estimates the time of completion to be approximately 17 years5 while Rolf Krauss based on this same graffiti suggests a period of construction of 1011 years6 an estimate later supported by John Romer.7 Archaeologists speculate its design may be an outcome of engineering crises experienced during the construction of Sneferus two earlier pyramids. The first of these the Pyramid at Meidum collapsed in antiquity while the second the Bent Pyramid had the angle of its inclination dramatically altered from 54 to 43 degrees partway through construction. Some archaeologists now believe that the Meidum pyramid was the first attempt at building a smoothsided pyramid and that it may have collapsed when construction of the Bent Pyramid was already well under way  and that the pyramid may by then have already begun to show alarming signs of instability itself as evident by the presence of large timber beams supporting its inner chambers. The outcome of this was the change in inclination of the Bent Pyramid and the commencement of the later Red Pyramid at an inclination known to be less susceptible to instability and therefore less susceptible to catastrophic collapse.8 Modern dayedit The Red Pyramid is 105 metres 344 ft high and 220 metres 720 ft wide.9 Fragments of a rare pyramidion or capstone for the Red Pyramid was uncovered and reconstructed and is now on display at the Red Pyramids site at Dahshur. However whether the fragments were actually ever part of a pyramidion is unclear as the reconstructions angle of inclination differs from that of the pyramid for which it was apparently intended. The Red Pyramid along with the Bent Pyramid was closed to tourists for many years because of a nearby army camp. It is now usually open for tourists and a somewhat intrusive ventilation system has been installed which pipes air down the entrance shaft to the interior chambers. Visitors climb steps cut in or built over the stones of the pyramid to an entrance high on the north side. A passage 3 feet 
0.9 1 m in height and 4 feet 
1.2  m wide slopes down at 27 for 200 feet 61 m to a short horizontal passage leading into a chamber whose corbelled roof is 40 feet 12 m high and rises in eleven steps. At the southern end of the chamber but offset to the west another short horizontal passage leads into the second chamber. This passage was probably closed at one time and the offset was a measure intended to confuse potential tomb robbers. The second chamber is similar to the first and lies directly beneath the apex of the pyramid. High in the southern wall of the chamber is an entrance now reached by a large wooden staircase built for the convenience of tourists. This gives onto a short horizontal passage that leads to the third and final chamber with a corbelled roof 50 feet 15 m high. The first two chambers have their long axis aligned northsouth but this chambers long axis is aligned eastwest. Unlike the first two chambers which have fine smooth floors on the same level as the passages the floor of the third chamber is very rough and sunk below the level of the access passage. It is believed that this is the work of tomb robbers searching for treasure in what is thought to have been the burial chamber of the pyramid.
