2 nd Dynasty around 2740 BC SethPeribsen also known as AshPeribsen Peribsen and Perabsen is the serekh name of an early Egyptian monarch pharaoh who ruled during the Second Dynasty of Egypt c. 2890  c. 2686 BC.1 His chronological position within this dynasty is unknown and it is disputed who ruled both before and after him. The duration of his reign is also unknown.2 Peribsens name is unusual in that Set not Horus was his patron deity. This goes against the Egyptian tradition of a king choosing the falconshaped deity Horus as his royal patron. Peribsens tomb was discovered in 1898 at Abydos. It was well preserved and showed traces of restoration undertaken during later dynastic periods.3 Attestationsedit Contemporaneous sourcesedit Granodiorite tomb stela of Peribsen now on display at the British Museum4 The serekh for Peribsen was found pressed in earthen jar seals made of clay and mud and in inscriptions on alabaster sandstone porphyry and black schist vessels. These seals and vessels were excavated from Peribsens tomb and at an excavation site in Elephantine. One clay seal with Peribsens name was found inside the mastaba tomb K1 at Beit Khallaf.567 Two large tomb stelae made of granite were found at his burial site. Their shape is unusual and they appear unfinished and rough. Egyptologists suspect that this was done deliberately but the reasons are unknown.89 A cylinder seal of unknown provenance shows Peribsens name inside a cartouche and gives the epithet Merjnetjeru beloved of the gods. This arrangement leads Egyptologists and archaeologists to the conclusion that the seal must have been created later in memoriam because the use of royal cartouches began long after Peribsens reign. Another seal of the same material shows Peribsens name without a cartouche but with the royal title NisutBity king of Upper and Lower Egypt instead.1011 Historical sourcesedit Existing skeptical views about Peribsens existence are based on New Kingdom Ramesside king lists such as the Abydos King List the Saqqara King List and the Royal Canon of Turin which all omit Peribsens name. These however are known to have been created nearly 1500 years after his death12 and several Fourth Dynasty tombs of priests performing the funerary cult for Peribsen have been uncovered. These tombs report Peribsens name correctly and their existence demonstrates that Peribsen was seen as a legitimate pharaoh not subject to damnatio memoriae as Akhenaten later would be. Historians and Egyptologists therefore consider the possibility that Peribsens name was actually forgotten over time or that his name was preserved in a distorted misspelled form.13 Nameedit prjb.sn in hieroglyphs Peribsens royal name is a subject of curiosity for Egyptologists because it is connected to the deity Seth rather than Horus as was traditional for the name of a pharaoh. Traditionally the Horus name of the king was written within a serekh the image of the facade of the royal palace beneath a falcon representing the god Horus see Egyptian hieroglyphs. Instead Peribsen chose to have the Set animal representing Seth on his serekh. Although Peribsen is the only known pharaoh to have the Set animal preside alone over his serekh he is not the only king to associate himself with Seth. Examples include the 
13 th Dynasty pharaoh Seth Meribre14 the 
19 th Dynasty rulers Seti I and Seti II and the 
20 th Dynasty king Setnakhte.1516 The debate continues over why Peribsen chose this name. Earlier theories favoured the idea that Egypt was split into two realms during Peribsens time or that he was a heretic who sought to start a new monotheistic religion with Seth as the only worshipped god.12 However newer evidence and evaluations tend to show that the Egyptian kingdom was unified but witnessed a vast and profound reform during the Second Dynasty. Seal impressions from tombs of this era reveal great changes in the titles held by high officials pointing to a reduction of their power. Further seal impressions show that several deities were worshipped under Peribsen refuting the monotheism theory. Other contemporary inscriptions indicate that Egyptian grammar was perfected during his time In particular the earliest seal impressions with complete sentences date back to Peribsens reign. Thus Peribsens reign was in fact a time of cultural and religious advancement.1718 Peribsens choice of patron and his rule during the shadowy period of the midSecond Dynasty have led Egyptologists and historians to search for possible explanations for both his name and the troubled times he lived in. The following sections discuss some of the theories that they have put forth. Religious theories uniting Peribsen with Sethedit Inscription from a porphyryvase displaying the serekh of Peribsen note the Sethanimal with a sundisk above.19 Older theories A theory that was popular until the mid
20 th century supported by Egyptologists Percy Newberry Jaroslav ern20 Walter Bryan Emery21 and Bernhard Grdseloff fr12 held that Peribsen was a heretic who sought to introduce a new monotheistic state religion to Egypt with Seth as the only worshipped god. Peribsens actions were thought to be similar to those of the much later 
18 th Dynasty pharaoh Akhenaten who had required Egyptians to serve only the Aten. Newberry proposed that the priests of Horus and Seth fought each other in the manner of a War of the Roses during the second half of the Second Dynasty.22 The heretic Peribsen theory was based on three observations that the name Peribsen was excluded from later king lists that the kings tomb had been destroyed and plundered during antiquity and finally that the tomb stelae of Peribsen that once displayed the Set animal were badly scratched with the clear intention of effacing the Seth image. Egyptologists hypothesized these were the actions of religious opponents to the Sethian priestcaste.2022 Lauer and Firth relied on the heretic Peribsen theory to explain the enormous quantity of stone vessels inscribed with the name of First and Second Dynasty kings found beneath Djosers pyramid in bags bearing seals of Khasekhemwy and Djoser. They proposed that Peribsen had plundered the tombs of his predecessors followers of Horus and scattered their funerary equipment. These vessels were gathered in the royal treasury during Khasekhemwys reign following his reunification of Egypt and finally put beneath the Step Pyramid by Djoser in an act of pious devotion.23 Contemporary theories Today this theory as well as Lauer and Firths conclusions is widely questioned. Archaeological evidence of Peribsen has been found almost entirely in Upper Egypt. In particular his name does not appear in Lower Egyptian records surviving from that time. It is argued that Peribsen may not have ruled over all of Egypt and therefore did not have the authority to force a change in state religion. Another piece of evidence that argues against the heretic Peribsen theory is the false door of the priest Shery at Saqqara. Shery held office during the early Fourth Dynasty. The inscription on the false door connects the name of Peribsen in one sentence with another shadowy king of the Second Dynasty Senedj. According to the addendum Shery was overseer of all wabpriests of king Peribsen in the necropolis of king Senedj in his mortuary temple and at all other places. This implies that the funerary cult of Peribsen continued at least until the Fourth Dynasty inconsistent with the assumption that Peribsens name was not allowed to be mentioned. Additionally Egyptologists such as Herman te Velde de point out that Shery was not the only Fourth Dynasty priest participating in the funerary cult of Peribsen. Inkef possibly a brother or cousin of Shery also held the title of a supervisor of Kapriests of Peribsen.17 Seal impressions found in Peribsens tomb at Abydos show several deities Ash Min and Bastet suggesting they were venerated during Peribsens time on the throne. This finding argues against Peribsen worshipping a single god or promoting monotheism.242526 The heretic theory of Newberry ern Grdseloff and others was devised from the very limited archaeological information available during their lifetimes. Most of the clay seal impressions found were still undeciphered and untranslated in their time.27 Vessel from the tomb of king Peribsen Ashmolean Museum. In the opinion of Sainte Fare Garnot 1956 and te Velde 1956 the name of Peribsen accords religious meaning even before association with a deity. The name Peribsen literally means He who comes forth by their will or His heart and will comes forth for them.citation neededclarification needed The Egyptian syllable sn means them their those revealing a clear plural writing. Te Velde and Garnot are convinced that Peribsen used the heraldic Seth animal as a serekh patron but also linked his name to Horus. If true it would prove that Peribsen worshipped Horus and Seth on an equal footing during his lifetime.1728 An ostentatious plural meaning with religious ambiguity was not uncommon for pharaohs names in the early Egyptian dynasties. Peribsen may have been perceived as a living incarnation of both Horus and Seth in equal measure just like his predecessors on the throne. Therefore Peribsens name may actually show no break in the sacred tradition he added the power of Seth to Horus. As further examples the titles of early dynastic queens used plural patron deities such as she who is allowed to see Horus and Seth and she who carries Horus and Seth.1728 Similarly the unusual serekh of king Khasekhemwy the last ruler of the Second Dynasty shows the deities Horus and Seth together atop the serekh. Horus wears the White Crown of Upper Egypt and Seth wears the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. The two gods are depicted facing each other in a kissing gesture. This special name was meant to illustrate the dual incarnation of the king as the representative of Horus and Seth with power over all Egypt. Khasekhemwys name can be interpreted as an advanced form of Peribsens serekh name.1728 Egyptologists Ludwig David Morenz and Wolfgang Helck29 remark that the targeted gouging of Sethanimals did not occur until the New Kingdom of Egypt. The erasure of the Seth chimera on Peribsens tomb stelae had been attributed to activity shortly after his death under the heretic theory new discoveries suggested the defamation occurred centuries later.30 Historian Dietrich Wildung states that the necropolis of Abydos was not the only one plundered in antiquity the tombs at Saqqara and Giza were also ransacked. Thus he concludes that any targeted action against one particular pharaoh can be excluded.31 Political theoriesedit The earlier theories of Newberry ern and Grdseloff12 said that the Egyptian state under Peribsen suffered from several civil wars either economic or political in origin. If he was held responsible for the putative misery in the past this could explain why later king lists excluded Peribsen.2022 In contrast more recent theories now hold that if the Egyptian kingdom was divided the division happened peacefully. Egyptologists such as Michael Rice32 Francesco Tiradritti33 and Wolfgang Helck point to the once palatial and well preserved mastaba tombs at Saqqara and Abydos belonging to high officials such as Ruaben de and NeferSetekh. These are all dated from the reign of Nynetjer to that of Khasekhemwy the last ruler of the Second Dynasty. Egyptologists consider the archaeological record of the mastabas condition and the original architecture as proof that the statewide mortuary cults for kings and noblemen operated successfully during the entire dynasty. If true their preservation is inconsistent with the theory of civil wars and economic problems during Peribsens reign. Rice Tiradritti and Helck think that Nynetjer decided to leave a divided realm because of private or political reasons and that the split was a formality sustained by Second Dynasty kings.323334 The origin of the political division is unknown. It might have happened at the beginning of Peribsens rule or shortly before. Because Peribsen chose the deity Seth as his new throne patron Egyptologists are of the view that Peribsen was a chieftain from Thinis or a prince of the Thinite royal house. This theory is based on Seth being a deity of Thinite origin which would explain Peribsens choice his name changing may have been nothing more than smart political and religious propaganda.3435 Peribsen is thought to have gained the Thinite throne and ruled only Upper Egypt whilst other rulers held the Memphite throne and ruled Lower Egypt.27 Identityedit Seal impression of king Sekhemib from Abydos Seal impression of Peribsen Egyptologists Walter Bryan Emery Kathryn A. Bard and Flinders Petrie believe that Peribsen was also known as SekhemibPerenmaat another Second Dynasty ruler that had connected his name with the falcon god Horus. As evidence clay seals of Sekhemib found in the entrance of Peribsens tomb support this hypothesis. Sekhemibs tomb has not yet been found.1363738 This theory is debatable Hermann Alexander Schlgl de Wolfgang Helck Peter Kaplony39 and Jochem Kahl40 argue that the clay seals were only found at the entrance area of Peribsens tomb and none of them depict Peribsen and Sekhemibs names together in one inscription. Furthermore they remark that it was customary for a pharaoh to bury his predecessor and seal his tomb the presence of Sekhemibs seals shows the line of dynastic inheritance. Similar inferences can be drawn from the ivory tablets of king Hotepsekhemwy found at the entrance of king Qaas tomb and the clay seals of Djoser found at the entrance of Khasekhemwys tomb. Schlgl Helck Kaplony and Kahl are convinced that the discovery of Sekhemibs seals support the view that Sekhemib immediately succeeded Peribsen and buried him.2741 Scholars Toby Wilkinson and Helck believe that Peribsen and Sekhemib could have been related. Their theory is based on the stone vessel inscriptions and seal impressions that show strong similarities in their typography and grammar. The vessels of Peribsen show the notation inisetjet tribute of the people of Sethro whilst Sekhemibs inscriptions have the notation inikhasut tribute of the desert nomads. A further indication that Peribsen and Sekhemib were related is their serekh names they both used the syllables Per and ib in their names.4243 The false door inscription of Shery might indicate that Peribsen is identical with king Senedj Senedj means the frightening and that this name was used in the king lists by proxy as the Seth name was forbidden to mention.44 In contrast Dietrich Wildung and Wolfgang Helck identify Peribsen with the Ramesside cartouche name Wadjenes. They think it is possible that the name Peribsen was misread from a sloppy hieratic inscription of Wadjsen.45 Reignedit Seal impression from Peribsens tomb with the first known complete sentence in Egyptian history As some archaeological records support the view that the Egyptian state was divided during Peribsens reign there is continued debate as to why his predecessors decided to divide the realm and whether Peribsen ruled part or all of Egypt. Proponents of the dividedrealmtheoryedit Egyptologists Wolfgang Helck41 Nicolas Grimal Hermann Alexander Schlgl46 and Francesco Tiradritti believe that king Nynetjer the third ruler of the Second dynasty and predecessor to Peribsen ruled an Egypt that was suffering from an overly complex state administration. Nynetjer decided to split Egypt to leave it to two chosen successors who would rule two separate kingdoms in the hope that the state administration could improve. Archaeological evidence such as the imprinted clay seals and inscribed jars appear to support the claim that Peribsen ruled only in Upper Egypt. A great number of these were found in Abydos Naqada and at Elephantine with only a single clay seal bearing his name found in Lower Egypt at Beit Khallaf. Historians think Peribsens realm would have extended from Naqada to the Isle of Elephantine. The rest of Egypt would therefore have been controlled by a different coexisting ruler.3347 Egyptologist Dimitri B. Proussakov supports his theory with notations on the famous Palermo stone concerning the year events of king Nynetjer. From the twelfth year event onward The king of Upper and Lower Egypt appears was amended to The king of Lower Egypt appears. Proussakov sees this as a strong indication that Nynetjers power over Egypt had diminished.48 Egyptologists compare the situation to that of king Qaa one of the last rulers of the First Dynasty. When Qaa died obscure claimants appeared and battled for the throne of Egypt. The struggles reached an apex with the plundering of the royal cemetery at Abydos whereupon the cemetery was abandoned and Saqqara became the new royal burial site. The conflict was ended by the ascension of king Hotepsekhemwy the founder of the Second Dynasty.4950 Barbara Bell another scholar believes that an economic catastrophe such as a famine or a longlasting drought affected Egypt. To better address the problem of feeding the Egyptian population Nynetjer split the realm into two and his successors founded two independent realms perhaps with intent to reunite after the famine. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone where in her opinion the records of the annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period.51 Bells theory is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer who asserts her calculations were incorrect. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at usual levels at Nynetjers time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell overlooked that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription take into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis but not elsewhere along the river. A statewide drought was unlikely.52 Rulers of Lower and Upper Egypt Egyptian historians such as Helck Tiradritti Schlgl Emery and Grimal are convinced that Peribsen was a coruler. The investigation into the rulers of Lower Egypt is ongoing. The Rammesside king lists differ in their order of royal names from king Senedj onward. The royal table of Sakkara and the royal canon of Turin reflect Memphite traditions which only allowed Memphite rulers to be mentioned. The Abydos king list reflects instead the Thinite traditions and therefore only Thinite rulers appear on that list. Until king Senedj all the king lists are in agreement. After him the Sakkara list and the Turin list mention three kings as successors Neferkara I Neferkasokar and Hudjefa I. The Abydos king list jumps forward to Khasekhemwy calling him Djadjay. The discrepancies are considered by Egyptologists to be the result of the division of Egypt during the Second dynasty.27334753 Alabaster fragment with the nebtiname Weneg.54 Additional contradictory findings are the Horus and Nebty names of kings discovered in the Great Southern Gallery in the necropolis of the Third dynasty king Djoser at Sakkara. Stone vessel inscriptions mention the kings Nubnefer WenegNebty Horus Ba Horus Bird and Za each of these is mentioned only a few times suggesting their reigns were short. King Sneferka might be identical with king Qaa or an ephemeral successor of his. King WenegNebty might be identical with the Ramesside cartouche name Wadjenes. But kings such as Nubnefer Bird and Za remain a mystery. They never appear anywhere else and the number of objects surviving from their lifetimes is very limited. Schlgl Helck and Peter Kaplony postulate that Nubnefer Za and Bird were contemporaries of Peribsen and Sekhemib and ruled over Lower Egypt whilst the latter two ruled Upper Egypt.2733475355 Opponents of the dividedrealmtheoryedit Scholars such as Herman TeVelde17 I. E. S. Edwards56 and Toby Wilkinson13 believe the inscription of the famous Annal stone of Fifth dynasty a black olivinbasalt slabstone displaying a very detailed king list argues against the division of the realm. On the stone the kings from 
1 st to 
7 th dynasty are listed by their Horus name their gold name and their cartouche name their name banderoles end with the name of their royal mother. The lists also contain rectangular windows presenting year events from the day of kings coronation up to his death. The most famous fragments of the Annal stone are called Palermo Stone and Cairo Stone. On the Cairo stone in line IV the nine last years of king Nynetjer are preserved but most of the year windows are illegible now.13 The date of Nynetjers death is followed by a new king. Recent investigations reveal that the serekh of that new king is surmounted by a fourlegged animal not by the Horusfalcon. Since the only fourlegged heraldic serekh animal in early Egypt was the chimera of the god Seth despite passionate disagreement the indicated ruler is likely to be Peribsen. Egyptologists such as TeVelde Barta and Edwards do not agree Peribsen might have not been the only king with a Sethname. The year events under Nynetjer show increasing references to Seth suggesting the tradition of a Horus name as the sole name of kings might have already evolved. The rise of a king allied with Seth was thus unsurprising. TeVelde Barta and Edwards think that in addition to Peribsen the rulers Wadjenes Nubnefer or Sened might have been Sethkings as well one of them surely was the true direct successor of Nynetjer. The comparatively large amount of archaeological finds from Peribsens reign contradict the brief estimated length of rulership only 10 to 12 years as presented on the Annal stone.13 The Annal stone gives absolutely no indication of a division of the Egyptian realm. Barta TeVelde Wilkinson and Edwards argue that the theory of state division is untenable. An administrative reorganization or split in the priesthood sects is more likely.13 Political accomplishmentsedit During his time on the throne Peribsen founded an administrative center called The white house of treasury as well as a new royal residence called the protection of Nubt located near Ombos Nubt being the Ancient Egyptian name of Naqada.57 The administrative titles of scribes sealbearers and overseers were adjusted to correspond to the divided bureaucratic state administration. For example titles like sealer of the king were changed into sealer of the king of Upper Egypt. This bureaucratic reform may indicate an attempt by Peribsen to limit the power of these officials further evidence for a bloated and unwieldy state administration under Nynetjer.58 The administration system under Peribsen and Sekhemib had a clear and welldefined hierarchy as an example from highest to the lowest rank Treasury house royal and therefore highest in ranking  pension office  property  vineyards  private vineyard property of citizens and therefore lowest in ranking. King Khasekhemwy the last ruler of the Second dynasty was able to reunify the state administration of Egypt and therefore unite the whole of Ancient Egypt. He brought the two treasury houses of Egypt under the control of the House of the King bringing them into a new single administration centre.585960 Peribsen also founded royal edifices such as Pernubt house of Ombos and PerMedjed house of meetings and created several cities of economic importance. Their names Afnut city of the headdressmakers Nebj protectors city Abetdesheret city of the red granite jars and Hujsetjet city of the Asians are mentioned on numerous clay seals alongside Peribsens serekh often preceded by the phrase visit of the king at ....6061 Inscriptions on stone vessels also mention an inisetjet tribute of the people of Sethro which might indicate that Peribsen founded a cult centre for the deity Seth in the Nile Delta. This may suggest Peribsen ruled over the whole of Egypt or at least that he was accepted as king across all of Egypt.62 One official from Peribsens reign NeferSetekh Seth is beautiful the wabpriest of the king is known to Egyptologists by his stela. His name may highlight the appearance and popularity of Seth as a royal deity.53 In Peribsens tomb at Abydos clay seals were found that demonstrate the first complete written sentence in recorded Egyptian history. The inscription reads63 The golden oneHe of Ombos hath unifiedhanded over the two realms forto his son the king of Lower and Upper Egypt Peribsen. The title The golden one also read as He of Ombos is considered by Egyptologists to be a religious form of address to the deity Seth.646566 Religious changesedit Despite his alignment with Seth numerous deities were worshipped by the populace under Peribsen. Numerous clay seal impressions and jar inscriptions mention the gods Ash Horus Nekhbet Min Bastet and Kherty. The depictions of the deities are followed by the name of the place or town where they had their principal cult center. On the Cairo stone a statue of Ash and a fetish of Seth are credited to Peribsen complementing the clay seal impressions. Curiously several seal impressions show a sun disc over the Seth chimera atop the royal serekh the ancient symbol for the god Ra. There is no archaeologic proof that the sun god Ra was part of the Egyptian pantheon at this early date the appearance of the disc may be the first evidence of the evolving sun cult and theistic change. The sun disc appears in connection to one of the state patrons for example under Peribsens predecessor Raneb the sun was connected to Horus under Peribsen it was connected to Seth. Under king Khasekhemwy the sun finally received its own name ra and at the time of throne change between Khasekhemwy and his follower Djoser several priests and officials also connected their name to Ra.6768 Tombedit Peribsens funerary enclosure at Abydos in the background the Great Enclosure of king Khasekhemwy is visible Mehen game board from Peribsens tomb in Abydos on display at the Louvre. Peribsen was buried in the tomb P of the royal cemetery at Umm elQaab near Abydos. The first excavation of the tomb started in 1898 under the supervision of French archaeologist and Egyptologist mile Amlineau.69 This first foray was followed by excavations in 1901 and 1902 under the supervision of British archaeologist Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie.57071 Further exploration of the tomb was undertaken in 1928 by the Swiss Egyptologist Edouard Naville.72 The tombs construction is straightforward and compared to the size of other royal tombs in the same area surprisingly small. The design model was the tomb of king Djer third pharaoh of the First dynasty thought to be the Tomb of Osiris from the Middle Kingdom. The architecture of Peribsens tomb is similar to the residential palace. The tomb measures 16 metres 52 ft x 13 metres 43 ft and comprises three independent structures nested into one another in the center is the main burial chamber measuring 
7.3  metres 24 ft x 
2.9  metres 
9.5  ft and which is made of mud bricks reeds and wood. On the north east and west sides the burial chamber is surrounded by nine small storage rooms leading into one another on the south face is a long antechamber. A passageway runs between the inner structures and the outer wall.57071 Excavations under the supervision of the Deutsches Archologisches Institut Kairo DAIK in 2001 and 2004 revealed that the tomb had been erected and completed in a great hurry. The building works took place in a single phase the walls were plastered roughly and the monument had collapsed several times over the centuries. During the Middle Kingdom Peribsens tomb was restored at least twice together with the tomb of Djer which was thought to be that of Osiris.7073 Findingsedit The tomb had been extensively plundered by tomb robbers during antiquity yet numerous stone vessels and earthen jars remained. Some of the stone vessels had coppercoated rims and are similar to the better known finds from tomb of Khasekhemwy. Vessels from preceding rulers such as Nynetjer and Raneb were also found. Beads and bracelets made of fayence and carnelian and tools made of copper were excavated. Special findings include a silver needle engraved with the name of king Hor Aha and clay seal fragments with the name of king Sekhemib. The two stone stelae from the entrance common to burial chambers of the First and Second dynasties are now on display in two different museums.57071 Royal funerary enclosureedit A royal funerary enclosure made of mud bricks was found close to Peribsens tomb. Clay seals with Peribsens serekh name on them were located near the eastern entrance and inside a destroyed offering shrine. The findings support the view that the building was part of Peribsens burial site. The funerary enclosure is commonly known as Middle Fort. This was first discovered in 1904 under the supervision of Canadian archaeologist Charles Trick Currelly and British Egyptologist Edward Russell Ayrton. The enclosure wall was located on the northwest side of Khasekhemwys funerary enclosure Shunet El Zebib raisin barn. Peribsens measures 108 metres 354 ft x 55 metres 180 ft and housed only a few cult buildings. The enclosure has three entrances one to the east one to the south and one to the north. A small shrine measuring 
12.3  metres 40 ft x 
9.7 5 metres 
32.0  ft was located at the southeast corner of the funerary enclosure. It once comprised three small chapels. No subsidiary tombs were found.707174 The tradition of burying the family and court of the king when he died was abandoned at the time of Qaa one of the last rulers of the First dynasty.75 Referencesedit  a b Kathryn A.
