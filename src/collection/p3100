15 th century BC. Ancient Egyptian culture Architecture Art Clothing Cuisine Dance Literature v t e Ancient Egyptian clothes refers to clothing worn in ancient Egypt from the end of the Neolithic period prior to 3100 BC to the collapse of the Ptolemaic Kingdom with the death of Cleopatra in 30 BC. Egyptian clothing was filled with a variety of colors. Adorned with precious gems and jewels the fashions of the ancient Egyptians were made for not only beauty but also comfort. Egyptian fashion was created to keep cool while in the hot desert. Elements of Egyptian clothing Sample of ancient Egyptian linen from Saqqara dating to 390343 BC Late Period Modern illustration of a mans tunic in the style popularized in the New Kingdom In ancient Egypt linen was by far the most common textile. It helped people to be comfortable in the subtropical heat. Linen is made from the flax plant by spinning the fibers from the stem of the plant. Spinning weaving and sewing were very important techniques for all Egyptian societies. Plant dyes could be applied to clothing but the clothing was usually left in its natural color. Wool was known but considered impure. Only the wealthy wore animal fibers that were the object of taboos. They were used on occasion for overcoats but were forbidden in temples and sanctuaries. Peasants workers and other people of modest condition often wore nothing but the shenti made of flax was worn by all people. Slaves often worked naked.1 Unique headdresses included the khat a loose headcloth worn by men of noble rank and the nemes a striped cloth reserved for monarchs. Deities There were several ancient Egyptian deities related to fabrics clothing and weaving chiefly the god Hedjhotep and the goddess Tayt.2 Pharaohs Royal clothing is particularly well documented as well as the khat nemes and crowns of the pharaohs. The pharaohs would often wear animal skins usually leopard or lion as a sign of their station.1 Men From about 2130 BC during the Old Kingdom garments were simply constructed. Men wore wrap around skirts belted at the waist. This style of dress was consistent across class but higher class Egyptians wore more finely crafted pieces.3 While womens clothing changed during the Middle Kingdom mens clothing stayed largely static as evidenced by available art. The two most notable changes were the pleating of the skirts and the adoption of the triangular apron by upperclass men. This starched ornamented kilt was held up by a sash and worn over a loincloth.4 Two tunics and a chest of clothes tomb of Kha and Merit 
14 th century BCE Museo Egizio in Turin Artistic relics from the New Kingdom show the largest evolution in mens clothing. New Kingdom art depicts the use of sheer blouses with intricately pleated sleeves as well as more elaborate pleating of the skirts with sheer overskirts.5 Still only wealthier citizens could afford these materials6 Women Network dress.

The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology London Egyptian woman in a kalasiris Female statue with clothing 2118  1980 BC Museo Egizio Turin Italy During the Old Middle and New Kingdom ancient Egyptian women mostly wore a simple sheath dress called a kalasiris7 which is shown to cover the breasts in statues but in paintings and relief the single breast depicted in profile is exposed.8 Womens clothing in ancient Egypt was more conservative than mens clothing. The dresses were held up by one or two straps and were worn down to the ankle while the upper edge could be worn above or below the breasts. The length of the dress denoted the social class of the wearer.9 Beading or feathers were also used as an embellishment on the dress.10 Over the dress women had a choice of wearing shawls capes or robes. The shawl was a piece of fine linen cloth around 4 feet wide by 13 or 14 feet long which was mostly worn pleated. Surviving dresses consist of a body made from a tube of material sewn up one side supported not by straps but by a bodice with sleeves. In contrast to dresses shown in art such linen garments tend to be baggy and would conceal rather than reveal the body. It was made of linen a material that tends to sag but is shown to hug the body with no slag.11 Children Children wore no clothing until 6 years old. Once they turned six they were allowed to wear clothing to protect them from the dry heat. A popular hairstyle among children was the sidelock an unshaved length of hair on the right side of the head. Even though children usually wore no clothing they wore jewelry such as anklets bracelets collars and hair accessories.8 Wigs Merits wig from the tomb of Kha and Merit

Made from human hair and sometimes supplemented with date palm fiber they were often styled in tight curls and narrow braids.12 For special occasions both men and women could top their wigs with cones of perfumed fat that would melt to release their fragrance and condition the hair.13 Jewelry See also Ancient Egyptian flint jewelry Pectoral Ancient Egypt Usekh collar and Egyptian Finger and Toe stalls Pectoral of Senusret II Metropolitan Museum of Art Jewelry was very popular in ancient Egypt no matter the social class. It was heavy and rather voluminous. The main reason for wearing jewelry is because of its aesthetic function. The Egyptians were quite soberly dressed in white linen fabrics and jewelry offered a possibility for contrast.14 The Egyptian preference was towards the use of bright colors lustrous stones and precious metals. Gold was won in large quantities in the eastern desert of Egypt but also came from Nubia that was an Egyptian colony for centuries. On the other hand silver was rare and was imported from Asia. Therefore it was silver that was often considered more precious than gold. The eastern desert was also an important source for colorful semiprecious stones such as carnelian amethyst and jasper. In the Sinai were turquoise mines the deep blue lapis lazuli had to come from far away Afghanistan. Glass and faience glaze over a core of stone or sand were favorites to replace rocks because they could be produced in many colors.15 The Egyptians became very skilled when making jewelry from turquoise metals like gold and silver and small beads. Both men and women adorned themselves with earrings bracelets rings necklaces and neck collars that were brightly colored. Those who could not afford jewelry made from gold or other stones would make their jewelry from colored pottery beads.16 One creation that was specific to ancient Egypt was the gorgerine an assembly of metal discs worn on the chest either over bare skin or over a shirt and attached in the back.

18 th Dynasty sandals circa 13901352 BCE Cosmetics Main article Beauty and cosmetics in ancient Egypt Embalming allowed the development of cosmetics and perfumes.clarification needed The perfumes of Egypt were the most numerous but also the most sought and the costliest of antiquity which used them extensively. The Egyptians used makeup most of all the ancient people. Nails and hands were painted with henna. Black kohl which was used to mark eyes was obtained from galena. Eye shadow was made from crushed malachite. Red which was applied to lips came from ochre. These products were mixed with animal fat to make them compact and to preserve them. Both men and women wore galena or malachite eyeliner to protect the eyes and enhance their beauty. Findings were published by American Chemical Society in the journal Analytic Chemistry suggest that the use of lead in makeup was intentional. Findings suggest that the lead in combination with salts produced naturally by the body produce nitric oxide which boosts the immune system. It is believed that the production and result were intentional. The increase in immune productivity would help to prevent infections like conjunctivitis.17 Footwear Footwear was the same for both sexes. It consisted of coiled sewn sandals of leatherwork or for the priestly class papyrus. Since Egyptians were usually barefoot sandals were worn on special occasions or at times when their feet might get hurt.9 See also Biblical clothing Clothing in ancient Rome Clothing in ancient Greece Clothing in the ancient world References  a b Ancient Egyptian costumes.
