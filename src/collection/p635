Manetho writes that these kings ruled from Memphis since their pyramids were built at Saqqara very close one to another.26 By the Fifth Dynasty the religious institution had established itself as the dominant force in society27 a trend of growth in the bureaucracy and the priesthood and a decline in the pharaohs power had been established during Neferirkare Kakais reign.28 During Djedkare Isesis rule officials were endowed with greater authorityevidenced by the opulent private tombs they constructedeventually leading to the creation of a feudal system in effect.29 These established trendsdecentralization of authority coupled with growth in bureaucracyintensified during the three decades of Unass rule which also witnessed economic decline.30 This continued on into Sixth Dynasty leading into the First Intermediate Period.31 Tetiedit Main article Teti Teti is identified as the first king of the Sixth Dynasty3213 by Manetho after the conclusion of the reign of Unas.32 He acceded to the throne in the 
23 rd century BC.33 Teti is assigned a regnal duration of 30 or 33 years by Manetho34  improbably long as the celebration of a Sed festival is not attested to and the latest date recorded corresponds to the sixth cattle count 12 or 13 years into his reign. The Royal Canon of Turin RTC gives another unlikely estimate of seven months.11 The archaeologist Hartwig Altenmller mediates between Manetho and the record of the cattle count to offer a reign length of around 23 years.34 The Egyptologists Peter Clayton and William Smith accord 12 years to his reign.35
36 b The relationship between Teti and his predecessors remains unclear but his wife Iput is thought to be a daughter of Unas.3236 This would mean that Teti ascended to the throne as Unass soninlaw.34 His inauguration solved a potential succession crisis Unas had died without a male heir.31 Teti adopted the Horus name Seheteptawy meaning He who pacifies the Two Lands to establish his reign as one of renewed political unity.35 The transition appears to have occurred smoothly3613 and Teti retained officials from his predecessors of the Fifth Dynasty such as viziers Mehu and Kagemni who had begun their careers under Djedkare Isesi.34 Despite this the RTC too inserts a break between Unas and Teti which the Egyptologist Jaromr Malek contends relates to a change of location of the capital and royal residence.32 The capital migrated from White Wall to the populous suburbs further south to Djedisutderived from the name of Tetis pyramid and pyramid town and located east of the monument. The royal residence might have been yet further south in the valley away and across a lake from the city east of South Saqqarawhere the pyramids of Djedkare Isesi and Pepi I were built.39 Teti had his daughter Sesheshet married to one of his viziers and later chief priest Mereruka a clear sign of his interest in cooperating with the noble class.40 Mereruka was buried close to Tetis pyramid in a lavish tomb in North Saqqara.1135 As part of his policy of pacification Teti issued a decree exempting the temple at Abydos from taxation. He was the first ruler to be closely associated with the cult of Hathor at Dendera.11 Abroad Teti maintained trade relations with Byblos and Nubia.35 Teti commissioned the construction of a pyramid at North Saqqara. His pyramid follows the standard set by Djedkare Isesi with a base length of 
78.5  m 258 ft 150 cu converging to the apex at 53 attaining a peak height of 
52.5  m 172 ft 100 cu.41 The substructure of the pyramid was very similar to Unass and Djedkare Isesis it had a descending corridor and horizontal passage guarded at about the middle by three granite portcullises leading to an antechamber flanked to its east by the serdab with its three recesses and to its west by the burial chamber containing the sarcophagus.42 The walls of the chambers and a section of the horizontal passage were inscribed with Pyramid Texts as in Unas pyramid.43 The mortuary temple with the exception of its entrance conforms to the same basic plans as his predecessors.4344 The complex contained a cult pyramid to the southeast of the pyramid with base length 
15.7  m 52 ft 30 cu.45 The causeway connecting to the mortuary temple is yet to be excavated44 while the valley temple and pyramid town are entirely missing.43 Tetis pyramid became the site of a large necropolis and included the pyramids of his wives Neith and Iput mother of Pepi I.4647 Iputs skeleton was discovered buried in her pyramid in a wooden coffin.46 Manetho claims that Teti was assassinated by a bodyguard but no contemporary sources confirm this.3548 The story if true might explain the references to the ephemeral ruler Userkare proposed to have briefly reigned between Teti and Pepi I.35 Userkare is attested to in the Royal Turin Canon and Abydos kinglist and is mentioned in several contemporaneous documents.11 Pepi Iedit During this dynasty expeditions were sent to Wadi Maghara in the Sinai Peninsula to mine for turquoise and copper as well as to the mines at Hatnub and Wadi Hammamat. The pharaoh Djedkara sent trade expeditions south to Punt and north to Byblos and Pepi I sent expeditions not only to these locations but also as far as Ebla in modernday Syria. Pepi IIedit The most notable member of this dynasty was Pepi II who is credited with a reign of 94 years.49 Nitiqretedit Also known by the Greek name Nitocris this woman is believed by some authorities to have been not only the first female pharaoh but the first queen in the world although it is currently accepted that her name is actually a mistranslation of the king Neitiqerty Siptah.

6 th Dynasty. From Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology London The rise of the nobilityedit With the growing number of biographical inscriptions in nonroyal tombs50 our knowledge of the contemporary history broadens.51 For example we hear of an unsuccessful plot against Pepi I.52 We also read a letter written by the young king Pepi II excited that one of his expeditions will return with a dancing pygmy from the land of Yam located to the south of Nubia.53 These nonroyal tomb inscriptions are but one example of the growing power of the nobility which further weakened the absolute rule of the king. As a result it is believed that on the death of the longlived Pepi II his vassals were entrenched enough to resist the authority of his many successors which may have contributed to the rapid decline of the Old Kingdom.
