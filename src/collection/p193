1 st dynasty Narmer Ancient Egyptian nrmr may mean painful catfish stinging catfish harsh catfish or fierce catfish123 was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the Early Dynastic Period whose reign began at a date estimated to fall in the range 32732987 BC.4 He was the successor to the Protodynastic king Ka. Many scholars consider him the unifier of Egypt and founder of the First Dynasty and in turn the first king of a unified Egypt. He also had a prominently noticeable presence in Canaan compared to his predecessors and successors. Neithhotep is thought to be his queen consort or his daughter. A majority of Egyptologists believe that Narmer was the same person as Menes.a678 Historical identityedit Comparison of serekhs Name of Narmer in full format Name of HorAha in full format Reconstruction of the NarmerMenes Seal impression from Abydos Naqada Label reconstruction9 Although highly interrelated the questions of who was Menes and who unified Egypt are actually two separate issues. Narmer is often credited with the unification of Egypt by means of the conquest of Lower Egypt by Upper Egypt. Menes is traditionally considered the first kingpharaoh of Ancient Egypt and is identified by the majority of Egyptologists as the same person as Narmer  although a vigorous debate also proposes identification with HorAha Narmers successor as a primary alternative.b The issue is confusing because Narmer is a Horus name while Menes is a Sedge and Bee name personal or birth name. All of the King Lists which began to appear in the New Kingdom era list the personal names of the kings and almost all begin with Menes or begin with divine andor semidivine rulers with Menes as the first human king. The difficulty is aligning the contemporary archaeological evidence which lists Horus Names with the King Lists that list personal names. Two documents have been put forward as proof either that Narmer was Menes or alternatively HorAha was Menes. The first is the Naqada Label found at the site of Naqada in the tomb of Queen Neithhotep often assumed to have been the mother of Horus Aha.10 The label shows a serekh of HorAha next to an enclosure inside of which are symbols that have been interpreted by some scholars as the name Menes. The second is the seal impression from Abydos that alternates between a serekh of Narmer and the chessboard symbol mn which is interpreted as an abbreviation of Menes. Arguments have been made with regard to each of these documents in favour of Narmer or HorAha being Menes but in neither case is the argument conclusive.c The second document the seal impression from Abydos shows the serekh of Narmer alternating with the gameboard sign mn together with its phonetic complement the n sign which is always shown when the full name of Menes is written again representing the name Menes. At first glance this would seem to be strong evidence that Narmer was Menes.14 However based on an analysis of other early First Dynasty seal impressions which contain the name of one or more princes the seal impression has been interpreted by other scholars as showing the name of a prince of Narmer named Menes hence Menes was Narmers successor HorAha and thus HorAha was Menes.15 This was refuted by CervellAutuori 2005 pp. 4245 but opinions still vary and the seal impression cannot be said to definitively support either theory.16 Necropolis seal impression of the Egyptian pharaoh Den. Necropolis seal impression of the Egyptian pharaoh Qaa.17 Two necropolis sealings found in 1985 and 1991 in Abydos Umm elQaab in or near the tombs of Den18 and Qaa19 show Narmer as the first king on each list followed by HorAha. The Qaa sealing lists all eight of the kings of what scholars now call the First Dynasty in the correct order starting with Narmer. These necropolis sealings are strong evidence that Narmer was the first king of the First Dynasty hence the same person as Menes.20 Nameedit Serekhs bearing the rebus symbols nr catfish and mr chisel inside being the phonetic representation of Narmers name21 The complete spelling of Narmers name consists of the hieroglyphs for a catfish nrd and a chisel mr hence the reading Narmer using the rebus principle. This word is sometimes translated as raging catfish.23 However there is no consensus on this reading. Other translations of the adjective before catfish include angry fighting fierce painful furious bad evil biting menacing and stinging.123 Some scholars have taken entirely different approaches to reading the name that do not include catfish in the name at all242526 but these approaches have not been generally accepted. Rather than incorporating both hieroglyphs Narmers name is often shown in an abbreviated form with just the catfish symbol sometimes stylized even in some cases represented by just a horizontal line.27 This simplified spelling appears to be related to the formality of the context. In every case that a serekh is shown on a work of stone or an official seal impression it has both symbols. But in most cases where the name is shown on a piece of pottery or a rock inscription just the catfish or a simplified version of it appears. Two alternative spellings of Narmers name have also been found. On a mud sealing from Tarkhan the symbol for the jbird Gardiner sign G47 duckling has been added to the two symbols for Narmer within the serekh. This has been interpreted as meaning Narmer the masculine28 however according to Ilona Regulski29 The third sign the jbird is not an integral part of the royal name since it occurs so infrequently. Godron30 suggested that the extra sign is not part of the name but was put inside the serekh for compositional convenience. In addition two necropolis seals from Abydos show the name in a unique way While the chisel is shown conventionally where the catfish would be expected there is a symbol that has been interpreted by several scholars as an animal skin.31 According to Dreyer it is probably a catfish with a bulls tail similar to the image of Narmer on the Narmer Palette in which he is shown wearing a bulls tail as a symbol of power.32 Reignedit The date commonly given for the beginning of Narmers reign is c. 3100 BC.3334 Other mainstream estimates using both the historical method and radiocarbon dating are in the range c. 32732987 BC.e Unification of Upper and Lower Egyptedit The famous Narmer Palette discovered by James E. Quibell in the 18971898 season at Hierakonpolis35 shows Narmer wearing the crown of Upper Egypt on one side of the palette and the crown of Lower Egypt on the other side giving rise to the theory that Narmer unified the two lands.36 Since its discovery however it has been debated whether the Narmer Palette represents an actual historic event or is purely symbolic.f Of course the Narmer Palette could represent an actual historical event while at the same time having a symbolic significance. In 1993 Gnter Dreyer discovered a year label of Narmer at Abydos depicting the same event that is depicted on the Narmer Palette. In the First Dynasty years were identified by the name of the king and an important event that occurred in that year. A year label was typically attached to a container of goods and included the name of the king a description or representation of the event that identified the year and a description of the attached goods. This year label shows that the Narmer Palette depicts an actual historical event.37 Support for this conclusion in addition to Dreyer includes Wilkinson38 and Davies  Friedman.39 Although this interpretation of the year label is the dominant opinion among Egyptologists there are exceptions including Baines40 and Wengrow.41 Narmer Palette Narmer Palette Drawing front Drawing back Narmer Macehead The Narmer Macehead Narmer Macehead drawing. The design shows captives being presented to Pharaoh Narmer enthroned in a naos. Ashmolean Museum Oxford.43 The scene depicts a ceremony in which captives and plunder are presented to King Narmer who is enthroned beneath a canopy on a stepped platform. He wears the Red Crown of Lower Egypt holds a flail and is wrapped in a long cloak. To the left Narmers name is written inside a representation of the palace facade the serekh surmounted by a falcon. At the bottom is a record of animal and human plunder 400000 cattle 1422000 goats and 120000 captives.42 Archaeological evidence suggests that Egypt was at least partially unified during the reigns of Ka and IryHor Narmers immediate predecessors and perhaps as early as Scorpion I. Tax collection is probably documented for Ka44 and IryHor.45 The evidence for a role for Scorpion I in Lower Egypt comes from his tomb Uj in Abydos Upper Egypt where labels were found identifying goods from Lower Egypt.46 These are not tax documents however so they are probably indications of trade rather than subjugation. There is a substantial difference in the quantity and distribution of inscriptions with the names of those earlier kings in Lower Egypt and Canaan which was reached through Lower Egypt compared to the inscriptions of Narmer. Kas inscriptions have been found in three sites in Lower Egypt and one in Canaan.47 IryHor inscriptions have also been found in two sites in Lower Egypt and one in Canaan.4748 This must be compared to Narmer whose serekhs have been found in ten sites in Lower Egypt and nine sites in Canaan see discussion in Tomb and Artefacts section. This demonstrates a qualitative difference between Narmers role in Lower Egypt compared to his two immediate predecessors. There is no evidence in Lower Egypt of any Upper Egyptian kings presence before IryHor. The archaeological evidence suggest that the unification began before Narmer but was completed by him through the conquest of a polity in the northwest Delta as depicted on the Narmer Palette.49 The importance that Narmer attached to his unification of Egypt is shown by the fact that it is commemorated not only on the Narmer Palette but on a cylinder seal50 the Narmer Year Label37 and the Narmer Boxes51 and the consequences of the event are commemorated on the Narmer Macehead.52 The importance of the unification to ancient Egyptians is shown by the fact that Narmer is shown as the first king on the two necropolis seals and under the name Menes the first king in the later King Lists. Although there is archaeological evidence of a few kings before Narmer none of them are mentioned in any of those sources. It can be accurately said that from the point of view of Ancient Egyptians history began with Narmer and the unification of Egypt and that everything before him was relegated to the realm of myth. Peak of Egyptian presence in Canaanedit According to Manetho quoted in Eusebius Fr. 
7 a Menes made a foreign expedition and won renown. If this is correct and assuming it refers to Narmer it was undoubtedly to the land of Canaan where Narmers serekh has been identified at nine different sites. An Egyptian presence in Canaan predates Narmer but after about 200 years of active presence in Canaan53 Egyptian presence peaked during Narmers reign and quickly declined afterwards. The relationship between Egypt and Canaan began around the end of the fifth millennium and apparently came to an end sometime during the Second Dynasty when it ceased altogether.54 It peaked during Dynasty 0 through the reign of Narmer.55 Dating to this period are 33 Egyptian serekhs found in Canaan56 among which 20 have been attributed to Narmer. Prior to Narmer only one serekh of Ka and one inscription with IryHors name have been found in Canaan.57 The serekhs earlier than IryHor are either generic serekhs that do not refer to a specific king or are for kings not attested in Abydos.55 Indicative of the decline of Egyptian presence in the region after Narmer only one serekh attributed to his successor HorAha has been found in Canaan.55 Even this one example is questionable Wilkinson does not believe there are any serekhs of HorAha outside Egypt58 and very few serekhs of kings for the rest of the first two dynasties have been found in Canaan.59 The Egyptian presence in Canaan is best demonstrated by the presence of pottery made from Egyptian Nile clay and found in Canaang as well as pottery made from local clay but in the Egyptian style. The latter suggests the existence of Egyptian colonies rather than just trade.61 The nature of Egypts role in Canaan has been vigorously debated between scholars who suggest a military invasion62 and others proposing that only trade and colonization were involved. Although the latter has gained predominance6163 the presence of fortifications at Tell esSakan dating to Dynasty 0 through early Dynasty 1 period and built almost entirely using an Egyptian style of construction demonstrate that there must have also been some kind of Egyptian military presence.64 Regardless of the nature of Egypts presence in Canaan control of trade to and through Canaan was important to Ancient Egypt. Narmer probably did not establish Egypts initial influence in Canaan by a military invasion but a military campaign by Narmer to reassert Egyptian authority or to increase its sphere of influence in the region is certainly plausible. In addition to the quote by Manetho and the large number of Narmer serekhs found in Canaan a recent reconstruction of a box of Narmers by Dreyer may have commemorated a military campaign in Canaan.65 It may also represent just the presentation of tribute to Narmer by Canaanites.65 Neithhotepedit Narmer and HorAhas names were both found in what is believed to be Neithhoteps tomb which led Egyptologists to conclude that she was Narmers queen and mother of HorAha.66 Neithhoteps name means Neith is satisfied. This suggests that she was a princess of Lower Egypt based on the fact that Neith is the patron goddess of Sais in the Western Delta exactly the area Narmer conquered to complete the unification of Egypt and that this was a marriage to consolidate the two regions of Egypt.66 The fact that her tomb is in Naqada in Upper Egypt has led some to the conclusion that she was a descendant of the predynastic rulers of Naqada who ruled prior to its incorporation into a united Upper Egypt.67 It has also been suggested that the Narmer Macehead commemorates this wedding.68 However the discovery in 2012 of rock inscriptions in Sinai by Pierre Tallet69 raise questions about whether she was really Narmers wife.h Neithhotep is probably the earliest nonmythical woman in history whose name is known to us today.71 Tomb and artifactsedit Tombedit Chambers B17 and B18 in the Umm elQaab which constitute the tomb of Narmer Narmers tomb in Umm elQaab near Abydos in Upper Egypt consists of two joined chambers B17 and B18 lined in mud brick. Although both mile Amlineau and Petrie excavated tombs B17 and B18 it was only in 1964 that Kaiser identified them as being Narmers.
72 i Narmers tomb is located next to the tombs of Ka who likely ruled Upper Egypt just before Narmer and HorAha who was his immediate successor.j As the tomb dates back more than 5000 years and has been pillaged repeatedly from antiquity to modern times it is amazing that anything useful could be discovered in it. Because of the repeated disturbances in Umm elQaab many articles of Narmers were found in other graves and objects of other kings were recovered in Narmers grave. However Flinders Petrie during the period 189919037576 and starting in the 19
70 s the German Archaeological Institute DAIk have made discoveries of the greatest importance to the history of Early Egypt by their reexcavation of the tombs of Umm elQaab. Despite the chaotic condition of the cemetery inscriptions on both wood and bone seal impressions as well as dozens of flint arrowheads were found. Petrie says with dismay that hundreds of arrowheads were discovered by the French presumably Amlineau. What happened to them is not clear but none ended up in the Cairo Museum.77 Flint knives and a fragment of an ebony chair leg were also discovered in Narmers tomb all of which might be part of the original funerary assemblage. The flint knives and fragment of a chair leg were not included in any of Petries publications but are now at the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology University College London registration numbers UC35679 UC52786 and UC35682. According to Dreyer32 these arrowheads are probably from the tomb of Djer where similar arrowheads were found.78 It is likely that all of the kings of Ancient Egypt buried in Umm elQaab had funerary enclosures in Abydos northern cemetery near the cultivation line. These were characterized by large mud brick walls that enclosed space in which funerary ceremonies are believed to have taken place. Eight enclosures have been excavated two of which have not been definitely identified.7980 While it has yet to be confirmed one of these unidentified funerary enclosures may have belonged to Narmer.l Artifactsedit Narmer serekh in its full formal format on an alabaster vase from Abydos Narmer is well attested throughout Egypt southern Canaan and Sinai altogether 98 inscriptions at 26 sites.m At Abydos and Hierakonpolis Narmers name appears both within a serekh and without reference to a serekh. At every other site except Coptos Narmers name appears in a serekh. In Egypt his name has been found at 17 sites 4 in Upper Egypt Hierakonpolis86 Naqada8788 Abydos 7576 and Coptos8990 10 in Lower Egypt Tarkhan9192 Helwan9394 Zawyet elAryan95 Tell Ibrahim Awad96 Ezbet elTell97 Minshat Abu Omar9899 Saqqara100101 Buto102 Tell elFarkha103104 and Kafr Hassan Dawood105 1 in the Eastern Desert Wadi elQaash106 2 in the Western Desert Kharga Oasis107108 and Gebel Tjauti109110 During Narmers reign Egypt had an active economic presence in southern Canaan. Pottery sherds have been discovered at several sites both from pots made in Egypt and imported to Canaan and others made in the Egyptian style out of local materials. Twenty serekhs have been found in Canaan that may belong to Narmer but seven of those are uncertain or controversial. These serekhs came from eight different sites Tel Arad111112 En Besor Ein HaBesor113114 Tel esSakan115116 Nahal Tillah Halif Terrace117 Tel Erani Tel Gat118119 Small Tel Malhata120121 Tel Maahaz122 and Tel Lod123 Narmers serekh along with those of other Predynastic and Early Dynastic kings has been found at the Wadi Ameyra in the southern Sinai where inscriptions commemorate Egyptian mining expeditions to the area.124125 Nag elHamdulabedit First recorded at the end of the 
19 th century an important series of rock carvings at Nag elHamdulab near Aswan was rediscovered in 2009 and its importance only realized then.126127128 Among the many inscriptions tableau 
7 a shows a man wearing a headdress similar to the White Crown of Upper Egypt and carrying a scepter. He is followed by a man with a fan. He is then preceded by two men with standards and accompanied by a dog. Apart from the dog motif this scene is similar to scenes on the Scorpion Macehead and the recto of the Narmer Palette. The man equipped with pharaonic regalia the crown and scepter can clearly be identified as a king. Although no name appears in the tableau Darnell127 attributes it to Narmer based on the iconography and suggests that it might represent an actual visit to the region by Narmer for a Following of Horus ritual. In an interview in 2012 Gatto129 also describes the king in the inscription as Narmer. However Hendricks 2016 places the scene slightly before Narmer based in part on the uncharacteristic absence of Narmers royal name in the inscription. Popular cultureedit The First Pharaoh The First Dynasty Book 1 by Lester Picker is a fictionalized biography of Narmer. The author consulted with Egyptologist Gnter Dreyer to achieve authenticity.130 Murder by the Gods An Ancient Egyptian Mystery by William G. Collins is a thriller about Prince Aha later king HorAha with Narmer included in a secondary role.131 Pharaoh The Boy who Conquered the Nile by Jackie French is a childrens book ages 1014 about the adventures of Prince Narmer.132 The Third Gate by Lincoln Child is the third book in the Jeremy Logan series and revolves primarily around the discovery and exploration of a fictional secret burial place of Narmer. Warframe uses Narmers name for a faction added in The New War update that shares some similarities to the pharaohs reign.133 In The Kane Chronicles by Rick Riordan one of siblings Carter and Sadies parents comes from Narmers lineage the other from Ramses the Great book one The Red Pyramid page 195.

Levy Levantine and CyberArchaeology Laboratory UC San Diego See alsoedit First Dynasty of Egypt List of pharaohs Naqada III Scorpion II Upper Egypt Notesedit  Egyptologists have long debated whether Menes was the same person as Narmer or HorAha Narmers successor. A 2014 study by Thomas C. Heagy published in the Egyptological journal ArchoNil compiled a list of 69 Egyptologists who took either position. Fortyone of them have concluded that Menes was Narmer while 31 have concluded that Menes was HorAha. Three EgyptologistsFlinders Petrie Kurt Sethe and Stan Hendrickxon the list have first concluded that Menes was HorAha but later concluded that Menes was Narmer.5  The question of who was Meneshence who was the first king of the First Dynasty has been hotly debated. Since 1897 70 different authors have taken an opinion on whether it is Narmer or Aha.5 Most of these are only passing references but there have been several in depth analyses on both sides of the issues. Recent discussions in favor of Narmer include Kinnaer 2001 CervellAutuori 2005 and Heagy 2014. Detailed discussions in favor of Aha include Helck 1953 Emery 1961 pp. 3137 and Dreyer 2007. For the most part English speaking authors favor Narmer while German speaking authors favor HorAha. The most important evidence in favor of Narmer are the two necropolis seal impressions from Abydos which list Narmer as the first king. Since the publication of the first of the necropolis sealings in 1987 28 authors have published articles identifying Narmer with Menes compared to 14 who identify Narmer with HorAha.  In the upper right hand quarter of the Naqada label is a serekh of HorAha. To its right is a hillshaped triple enclosure with the mn sign surmounted by the signs of the two ladies the goddesses of Upper Egypt Nekhbet and Lower Egypt Wadjet. In later contexts the presence of the two ladies would indicate a nbty name one of the five names of the king. Hence the inscription was interpreted as showing that the nbty name of HorAha was Mn short for Menes.11 An alternative theory is that the enclosure was a funeral shrine and it represents HorAha burying his predecessor Menes. Hence Menes was Narmer.12 Although the label generated a lot of debate it is now generally agreed that the inscription in the shrine is not a kings name but is the name of the shrine The Two Ladies Endure and provide no evidence for who Menes was.13  Although the catfish portrayed in Narmers name has sometimes been described as an electric catfish based on its fin configuration it is actually of the nonelectric Heterobranchus genus.22  Establishing absolute dating for Ancient Egypt relies on two different methods each of which is problematic. As a starting point the Historical Method makes use of astronomical events that are recorded in Ancient Egyptian texts which establishes a starting point in which an event in Egyptian history is given an unambiguous absolute date. Dead reckoningadding or subtracting the length of each kings reign based primarily on Manetho the Turin King List and the Palermo Stone is then used until one gets to the reign of the king in question. However there is uncertainty about the length of reigns especially in the Archaic Period and the Intermediate Periods. Two astrological events are available to anchor these estimates one in the Middle Kingdom and one in the New Kingdom for a discussion of the problems in establishing absolute dates for Ancient Egypt see Shaw 20
00 a pp. 116. Two estimates based on this method are Hayes 1970 p. 174 who gives the beginning of the reign of NarmerMenes as 3114 BC which he rounds to 3100 BC and Krauss  Warburton 2006 p. 487 who places the ascent of Narmer to the throne of Egypt as c. 2950 BC. Several estimates of the beginning of the First Dynasty assume that it began with HorAha. Setting aside the question of whether the First Dynasty began with Narmer or HorAha to calculate the beginning of Narmers reign from these estimates they must be adjusted by the length of Narmers reign. Unfortunately there are no reliable estimates of the length of Narmers reign. In the absence of other evidence scholars use Manethos estimate of the length of the reign of Menes i.e. 62 years. If one assumes that Narmer and Menes are the same person this places the date for the beginning of Narmers reign at 62 years earlier than the date for the beginning of the First Dynasty given by the authors who associate the beginning of the First Dynasty with the start of HorAhas reign. Estimates of the beginning of Narmers reign calculated in this way include von Beckerath 1997 p. 179 c. 30943044 BC Helck 1986 p. 28 c. 2987 BC Kitchen 2000 p. 48 c. 3092 BC and Shaw 20
00 b p. 480 c. 3062 BC. Considering all six estimates suggests a range of c. 3114  2987 BC based on the Historical Method. The exception to the mainstream consensus is Mellaart 1979 pp. 910 who estimates the beginning of the First Dynasty to be c. 3400 BC. However since he reached this conclusion by disregarding the Middle Kingdom astronomical date his conclusion is not widely accepted. Radiocarbon Dating has unfortunately its own problems According to Hendrickx 2006 p. 90 the calibration curves for the second half of the 
4 th millennium BC show important fluctuations with long possible data ranges as a consequence. It is generally considered a bad period for Radiocarbon dating. Using a statistical approach including all available carbon 14 dates for the Archaic Period reduces but does not eliminate these inherent problems. Dee  et al. uses this approach and derive a 65 confidence interval estimate for the beginning of the First Dynasty of c. 3211  3045 BC. However they define the beginning of the First Dynasty as the beginning of the reign of HorAha. There are no radiocarbon dates for Narmer so to translate this to the beginning of Narmers reign one must again adjust for the length of Narmers reign of 62 years which gives a range of c. 32733107 BC for the beginning of Narmers reign. This is reassuringly close to the range of mainstream Egyptologists using the Historical Method of c. 3114  2987 BC. Thus combining the results of two different methodologies allows to place the accession of Narmer to c. 3273  2987 BC.  According to Schulman harvnb error no target CITEREFSchulman help the Narmer Palette commemorates a conquest of Libyans that occurred earlier than Narmer probably during Dynasty 0. Libyans in this context were not people who inhabited what is modern Libya but rather peoples who lived in the northwest Delta of the Nile which later became a part of Lower Egypt. Schulman describes scenes from Dynasty V 2 scenes Dynasty VI and Dynasty XXV. In each of these the king is shown defeating the Libyans personally killing their chief in a classic smiting the enemy pose. In three of these postNarmer examples the name of the wife and two sons of the chief are namedand they are the same names for all three scenes from vastly different periods. This proves that all but the first representation cannot be recording actual events but are ritual commemorations of an earlier event. The same might also be true of the first example in Dynasty V. The scene on the Narmer Palette is similar although it does not name the wife or sons of the Libyan chief. The Narmer Palette could represent the actual event on which the others are based. However Schulman following Breasted 1931 argues against this on the basis that the Palermo Stone shows predynastic kings wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt suggesting that they ruled a unified Egypt. Hence the Narmer Palette rather than showing a historic event during Narmers reign commemorates the defeat of the Libyans and the unification of Egypt which occurred earlier. Khler 2002 p. 505 proposes that the Narmer Palette has nothing to do with the unification of Egypt. Instead she describes it as an example of the subjecting the enemy motif which goes back as far as Naqada Ic about 400 years before Narmer and which represents the ritual defeat of chaos a fundamental role of the king. OConnor 2011 also argues that it has nothing to do with the unification but has a very complicated religious meaning.  During the summer of 1994 excavators from the Nahal Tillah expedition in southern Israel discovered an incised ceramic sherd with the serekh sign of Narmer. The sherd was found on a large circular platform possibly the foundations of a storage silo on the Halif Terrace. Dated to c. 3000 BCE mineralogical studies conducted on the sherd conclude that it is a fragment of a wine jar which had been imported from the Nile valley to Canaan.60  In 2012 Pierre Tallet discovered an important new series of rock carvings in Wadi Ameyra. This discovery was reported in Tallet 2015 and in 2016 in two web articles by Owen Jarus70 These inscriptions strongly suggest that Neithhotep was Djers regent for a period of time but do not resolve the question of whether she was Narmers queen. In the first of Jarus articles he quotes Tallet as saying that Neithhotep was not the wife of Narmer. However Tallet in a personal communication with Thomas C. Heagy explained that he had been misquoted. According to Tallet she could have been Narmers wife Djers grandmother but that it is more likely because Narmer and HorAha are both thought to have had long reigns that she was in the next generationfor example Djers mother or aunt. This is consistent with the discussion in Tallet 2015 pp. 2829.  For a discussion of Cemetery B see Dreyer 1999 pp. 11011 fig. 7 and Wilkinson 2000 pp. 2932 fig. 2  Narmers tomb has much more in common with the tombs of his immediate predecessors Ka and IryHor and other late Predynastic tombs in Umm elQaab than it does with later 
1 st Dynasty tombs. Narmers tomb is 31 sq. meters compared to HorAha whose tomb is more than three times as large not counting HorAhas 36 subsidiary graves. According to Deyer73 Narmers tomb is even smaller than the tomb of Scorpion I tomb Uj several generations earlier.74 In addition the earlier tombs of Narmer Ka and IryHor all have two chambers with no subsidiary chambers while later tombs in the 
1 st Dynasty all have more complex structures including subsidiary chambers for the tombs of retainers who were probably sacrificed to accompany the king in the afterlife.OConnor 2009 pp. 148150 To avoid confusion its important to understand that he classifies Narmer as the last king of the 0 Dynasty rather than the first king of the 
1 st Dynasty in part because Narmers tomb has more in common with the earlier 0 Dynasty tombs than it does with the later 
1 st Dynasty tombs.Dreyer 2003 p. 64 harvnb error no target CITEREFDreyer2003 help also makes the argument that the major shift in tomb construction that began with HorAha is evidence that HorAha rather than Narmer was the first king of the 
1 st Dynasty.  Numerous publications with either Werner Kaiser or his successor Gnter Dreyer as the lead authormost of them published in MDAIK beginning in 1977  Next to HorAhas enclosure is a large unattributed enclosure referred to as the Donkey Enclosure because of the presence of 10 donkeys buried next to the enclosure. No objects were found in the enclosure with a kings name but hundreds of seal impressions were found in the gateway chamber of the enclosure all of which appear to date to the reigns of Narmer HorAha or Djer. HorAha and Djer both have enclosures identified making Narmer the most attractive candidate for the builder of this monument.81 The main objection to its assignment to Narmer is that the enclosure is too big. It is larger than all three of HorAhas put together while HorAhas tomb is much larger than Narmers tomb. For all of the clearly identified 
1 st Dynasty enclosures there is a rough correlation between the size of the tomb and the size of the enclosure. Identifying the Donkey Enclosure with Narmer would violate that correlation. That leaves HorAha and Djer. The objection to the assignment of the enclosure to Aha is the inconsistency of the subsidiary graves of HorAhas enclosure and subsidiary graves of the donkeys. In addition the seeming completeness of the Aha enclosure without the Donkey Enclosure argues against HorAha. This leaves Djer whom Bestock considers the most likely candidate. The problems with this conclusion as identified by Bestock are that the Donkey Enclosure has donkeys in the subsidiary graves whereas Djer has humans in his. In addition there are no large subsidiary graves at Djers tomb complex that would correspond to the Donkey Enclosure.82 She concludes that the interpretation and attribution of the Donkey Enclosure remain speculative.83 There are however two additional arguments for the attribution to Narmer First it is exactly where one would expect to find Narmers Funerary Enclosureimmediately next to HorAhas. Second all of the 
1 st Dynasty tombs have subsidiary graves for humans except that of Narmer and all of the attributed 
1 st Dynasty enclosures except the Donkey Enclosure have subsidiary graves for humans. But neither Narmers tomb nor the Donkey Enclosure have known subsidiary graves for humans. The lack of human subsidiary graves at both sites seems important. It is also possible that Narmer had a large funerary enclosure precisely because he had a small tomb.8485 In the absence of finding an object with a Narmers name on it any conclusion must be tentative but it seems that the preponderance of evidence and logic support the identification of the Donkey Enclosure with Narmer.  Of these inscriptions 29 are controversial or uncertain. They include the unique examples from Coptos En Besor Tell elFarkhan Gebel Tjauti and Kharga Oasis as well as both inscriptions each from Buto and Tel Maahaz. Sites with more than one inscription are footnoted with either references to the most representative inscriptions or to sources that are the most important for that site. All of the inscriptions are included in the Narmer Catalog which also includes extensive bibliographies for each inscription. Several references discuss substantial numbers of inscriptions.
