For the book by Annette Imhausen see Mathematics in Ancient Egypt A Contextual History. Ancient Egyptian mathematics is the mathematics that was developed and used in Ancient Egypt c. 3000 to c. 300 BCE from the Old Kingdom of Egypt until roughly the beginning of Hellenistic Egypt. The ancient Egyptians utilized a numeral system for counting and solving written mathematical problems often involving multiplication and fractions. Evidence for Egyptian mathematics is limited to a scarce amount of surviving sources written on papyrus. From these texts it is known that ancient Egyptians understood concepts of geometry such as determining the surface area and volume of threedimensional shapes useful for architectural engineering and algebra such as the false position method and quadratic equations. Overviewedit Written evidence of the use of mathematics dates back to at least 3200 BC with the ivory labels found in Tomb Uj at Abydos. These labels appear to have been used as tags for grave goods and some are inscribed with numbers.1 Further evidence of the use of the base 10 number system can be found on the Narmer Macehead which depicts offerings of 400000 oxen 1422000 goats and 120000 prisoners.2 Archaeological evidence has suggested that the Ancient Egyptian counting system had origins in SubSaharan Africa.3 Also fractal geometry designs which are widespread among SubSaharan African cultures are also found in Egyptian architecture and cosmological signs.4 The evidence of the use of mathematics in the Old Kingdom c. 26902180 BC is scarce but can be deduced from inscriptions on a wall near a mastaba in Meidum which gives guidelines for the slope of the mastaba.5 The lines in the diagram are spaced at a distance of one cubit and show the use of that unit of measurement.1 The earliest true mathematical documents date to the 
12 th Dynasty c. 19901800 BC. The Moscow Mathematical Papyrus the Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll the Lahun Mathematical Papyri which are a part of the much larger collection of Kahun Papyri and the Berlin Papyrus 6619 all date to this period. The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus which dates to the Second Intermediate Period c. 1650 BC is said to be based on an older mathematical text from the 
12 th dynasty.6 The Moscow Mathematical Papyrus and Rhind Mathematical Papyrus are so called mathematical problem texts. They consist of a collection of problems with solutions. These texts may have been written by a teacher or a student engaged in solving typical mathematics problems.1 An interesting feature of ancient Egyptian mathematics is the use of unit fractions.7 The Egyptians used some special notation for fractions such as 12 13 and 23 and in some texts for 34 but other fractions were all written as unit fractions of the form 
1 n or sums of such unit fractions. Scribes used tables to help them work with these fractions. The Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll for instance is a table of unit fractions which are expressed as sums of other unit fractions. The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and some of the other texts contain 
2 n tables. These tables allowed the scribes to rewrite any fraction of the form 
1 n as a sum of unit fractions.1 During the New Kingdom c. 15501070 BC mathematical problems are mentioned in the literary Papyrus Anastasi I and the Papyrus Wilbour from the time of Ramesses III records land measurements. In the workers village of Deir elMedina several ostraca have been found that record volumes of dirt removed while quarrying the tombs.16 Sourcesedit Current understanding of ancient Egyptian mathematics is impeded by the paucity of available sources. The sources that do exist include the following texts which are generally dated to the Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period The Moscow Mathematical Papyrus8 The Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll8 The Lahun Mathematical Papyri8 The Berlin Papyrus 6619 written around 1800 BC The Akhmim Wooden Tablet6 The Reisner Papyrus dated to the early Twelfth dynasty of Egypt and found in Nag elDeir the ancient town of Thinis8 The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus RMP dated from the Second Intermediate Period c. 1650 BC but its author Ahmes identifies it as a copy of a now lost Middle Kingdom papyrus. The RMP is the largest mathematical text.8 From the New Kingdom there are a handful of mathematical texts and inscriptions related to computations The Papyrus Anastasi I a literary text written as a fictional letter written by a scribe named Hori and addressed to a scribe named Amenemope. A segment of the letter describes several mathematical problems.6 Ostracon Senmut 153 a text written in hieratic6 Ostracon Turin 57170 a text written in hieratic6 Ostraca from Deir elMedina contain computations. Ostracon IFAO 1206 for instance shows the calculation of volumes presumably related to the quarrying of a tomb.6 According to tienne Gilson Abraham taught the Egyptians arythmetic and astronomy.9 Numeralsedit Main articles Egyptian numerals and Egyptian fraction Ancient Egyptian texts could be written in either hieroglyphs or in hieratic. In either representation the number system was always given in base 10. The number 1 was depicted by a simple stroke the number 2 was represented by two strokes etc. The numbers 10 100 1000 10000 and 100000 had their own hieroglyphs. Number 10 is a hobble for cattle number 100 is represented by a coiled rope the number 1000 is represented by a lotus flower the number 10000 is represented by a finger the number 100000 is represented by a frog and a million was represented by a god with his hands raised in adoration.8 Hieroglyphics for Egyptian numerals2 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 Slab stela of Old Kingdom princess Neferetiabet dated 25902565 BC from her tomb at Giza painting on limestone now in the Louvre Egyptian numerals date back to the Predynastic period. Ivory labels from Abydos record the use of this number system. It is also common to see the numerals in offering scenes to indicate the number of items offered. The kings daughter Neferetiabet is shown with an offering of 1000 oxen bread beer etc. The Egyptian number system was additive. Large numbers were represented by collections of the glyphs and the value was obtained by simply adding the individual numbers together. This scene depicts a cattle count copied by the Egyptologist Lepsius. In the middle register we see 835 horned cattle on the left right behind them are some 220 animals cows and on the right 2235 goats. In the bottom register we see 760 donkeys on the left and 974 goats on the right. The Egyptians almost exclusively used fractions of the form 
1 n. One notable exception is the fraction 23 which is frequently found in the mathematical texts. Very rarely a special glyph was used to denote 34. The fraction 12 was represented by a glyph that may have depicted a piece of linen folded in two. The fraction 23 was represented by the glyph for a mouth with 2 different sized strokes. The rest of the fractions were always represented by a mouth superimposed over a number.8 Hieroglyphics for some fractions8 12 13 23 14 15 Notationedit Steps of calculations were written in sentences in Egyptian languages. e.g. Multiply 10 times 100 it becomes 1000. In Rhind Papyrus Problem 28 the hieroglyphs and D54 D55 symbols for feet were used to mean to add and to subtract. These were presumably shorthands for and meaning to go in and to go out.1011 Multiplication and divisionedit Main article Ancient Egyptian multiplication Egyptian multiplication was done by a repeated doubling of the number to be multiplied the multiplicand and choosing which of the doublings to add together essentially a form of binary arithmetic a method that links to the Old Kingdom. The multiplicand was written next to figure 1 the multiplicand was then added to itself and the result written next to the number 2. The process was continued until the doublings gave a number greater than half of the multiplier. Then the doubled numbers 1 2 etc. would be repeatedly subtracted from the multiplier to select which of the results of the existing calculations should be added together to create the answer.2 As a shortcut for larger numbers the multiplicand can also be immediately multiplied by 10 100 1000 10000 etc. For example Problem 69 on the Rhind Papyrus RMP provides the following illustration as if Hieroglyphic symbols were used rather than the RMPs actual hieratic script.8 To multiply 80  14 Egyptian calculation Modern calculation Result Multiplier Result Multiplier 80 1 800 10 160 2 320 4 1120 14 The denotes the intermediate results that are added together to produce the final answer. The table above can also be used to divide 1120 by 80. We would solve this problem by finding the quotient 80 as the sum of those multipliers of 80 that add up to 1120. In this example that would yield a quotient of 10  4  
14.8  A more complicated example of the division algorithm is provided by Problem 66. A total of 3200 ro of fat are to be distributed evenly over 365 days. Dividing 3200 by 365 1 365 2 730 4 1460 8 2920 23 24313 110 3612 12190 16 First the scribe would double 365 repeatedly until the largest possible multiple of 365 is reached which is smaller than 3200. In this case 8 times 365 is 2920 and further addition of multiples of 365 would clearly give a value greater than 3200. Next it is noted that 23  110  12190 times 365 gives us the value of 280 we need. Hence we find that 3200 divided by 365 must equal 8  23  110  121
90.8  Algebraedit Main article Egyptian algebra Egyptian algebra problems appear in both the Rhind mathematical papyrus and the Moscow mathematical papyrus as well as several other sources.8 Aha in hieroglyphs Era New Kingdom 15501069 BC Aha problems involve finding unknown quantities referred to as Aha if the sum of the quantity and parts of it are given. The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus also contains four of these type of problems. Problems 1 19 and 25 of the Moscow Papyrus are Aha problems. For instance problem 19 asks one to calculate a quantity taken 112 times and added to 4 to make 
10.8  In other words in modern mathematical notation we are asked to solve the linear equation 3 2  x  4  10. displaystyle frac 
32 times x410.  Solving these Aha problems involves a technique called method of false position. The technique is also called the method of false assumption. The scribe would substitute an initial guess of the answer into the problem. The solution using the false assumption would be proportional to the actual answer and the scribe would find the answer by using this ratio.8 The mathematical writings show that the scribes used least common multiples to turn problems with fractions into problems using integers. In this connection red auxiliary numbers are written next to the fractions.8 The use of the Horus eye fractions shows some rudimentary knowledge of geometrical progression. Knowledge of arithmetic progressions is also evident from the mathematical sources.8 Quadratic equationsedit The ancient Egyptians were the first civilization to develop and solve seconddegree quadratic equations. This information is found in the Berlin Papyrus fragment. Additionally the Egyptians solve firstdegree algebraic equations found in Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.12 Geometryedit Main article Egyptian geometry Image of Problem 14 from the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus. The problem includes a diagram indicating the dimensions of the truncated pyramid. There are only a limited number of problems from ancient Egypt that concern geometry. Geometric problems appear in both the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus MMP and in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus RMP. The examples demonstrate that the Ancient Egyptians knew how to compute areas of several geometric shapes and the volumes of cylinders and pyramids. Area Triangles The scribes record problems computing the area of a triangle RMP and MMP.8 Rectangles Problems regarding the area of a rectangular plot of land appear in the RMP and the MMP.8 A similar problem appears in the Lahun Mathematical Papyri in London.1314 Circles Problem 48 of the RMP compares the area of a circle approximated by an octagon and its circumscribing square. This problems result is used in problem 50 where the scribe finds the area of a round field of diameter 9 khet.8 Hemisphere Problem 10 in the MMP finds the area of a hemisphere.8 Volumes Cylindrical cylinder Several problems compute the volume of cylindrical granaries RMP 4143 while problem 60 RMP seems to concern a pillar or a cone instead of a pyramid. It is rather small and steep with a seked reciprocal of slope of four palms per cubit.8 In section IV.3 of the Lahun Mathematical Papyri the volume of a granary with a circular base is found using the same procedure as RMP 43. Rectangular Cuboid Several problems in the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus problem 14 and in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus numbers 44 45 46 compute the volume of a rectangular granary.13 Truncated pyramid frustum Frustum The volume of a truncated pyramid is computed in MMP 
14.8  The Seqededit Problem 56 of the RMP indicates an understanding of the idea of geometric similarity. This problem discusses the ratio runrise also known as the seqed. Such a formula would be needed for building pyramids. In the next problem Problem 57 the height of a pyramid is calculated from the base length and the seked Egyptian for the reciprocal of the slope while problem 58 gives the length of the base and the height and uses these measurements to compute the seqed. In Problem 59 part 1 computes the seqed while the second part may be a computation to check the answer If you construct a pyramid with base side 12 cubits and with a seqed of 5 palms 1 finger what is its altitude8 See alsoedit Red auxiliary number History of mathematics History of geometry Egyptian hieroglyphics and Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian Ancient Egyptian units of measurement and technology Mathematics and architecture Referencesedit  a b c d e Imhausen Annette 2006.
