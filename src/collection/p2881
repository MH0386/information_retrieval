20 th Dynasty Neferkare Setepenre Ramesses IX also written Ramses originally named Amonherkhepshef Khaemwaset ruled 11291111 BC1 was the eighth pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt. He was the third longest serving king of this Dynasty after Ramesses III and Ramesses XI. He is now believed to have assumed the throne on I Akhet day 21 based on evidence presented by Jrgen von Beckerath in a 1984 GM article.23 According to the latest archaeological information Ramesses IX died in Regnal Year 19 I Peret day 27 of his reign.4 Therefore he enjoyed a reign of 18 years 4 months and 6 days. His throne name Neferkare Setepenre means Beautiful Is The Soul of Re Chosen of Re.5 Ramesses IX is believed to be the son of Mentuherkhepeshef a son of Ramesses III since Mentuherkhopshefs wife the lady Takhat bears the prominent title of Kings Mother on the walls of tomb KV10 which she usurped and reused in the late 
20 th Dynasty no other 
20 th Dynasty king is known to have had a mother with this name.6 Ramesses IX was therefore probably a grandson of Ramesses III.7 Tomb robberiesedit Relief of Ramesses IX at Karnak His reign is best known for the year 16 and year 17 tomb robbery trials recorded in the Abbott Papyrus the Papyrus Leopold II Papyrus BM 10054 and on the recto of both Papyrus BM 10053 and Papyrus BM 10068. It has been suggested that the undated Papyrus Mayer B dealing with the plundering of the tomb of Ramesses VI8 may also stem from his reign. During these trials it became clear that several royal and noble tombs in the Western Theban Necropolis had been robbed including that of a 
17 th Dynasty king Sobekemsaf II. Paser Mayor of Eastern Thebes or Karnak accused his subordinate Paweraa the Mayor of West Thebes responsible for the safety of the necropolis of being either culpable in this wave of robberies or negligent in his duties of protecting the Valley of the Kings from incursions by tomb robbers. Paweraa played a leading part in the vizierial commission set up to investigate and not surprisingly it proved impossible for Paweraa to be officially charged with any crime due to the circumstantiality of the evidence. Paser disappeared from sight soon after the report was filed.9 Projectsedit Interior of Ramesses IXs KV6 royal tomb In the sixth year of his reign he inscribed his titulature in the Lower Nubian town of Amara West.10 Most of his building works centre on the sun temple centre of Heliopolis in Lower Egypt where the most significant monumental works of his reign are located.11 However he also decorated the wall to the north of the Seventh Pylon in the Temple of AmunRe at Karnak.12 Finally his name has been found at the Dakhla Oasis in Western Egypt and Gezer at Canaan which may suggest a residual Egyptian influence in Asia the majority of the New Kingdom Empires possessions in Canaan and Syria had long been lost to the Sea Peoples by his reign. He is also known for having honoured his predecessors Ramesses II Ramesses III and Ramesses VII. He also paid close attention to Lower Egypt and built a substantial monument at Heliopolis. Familyedit Relief of the pharaoh Ramesses IX from the Metropolitan Museum of Art Ramesses IX is known to have had two sons at Heliopolis a gateway was reinscribed with texts including the kings names and also those of the prince and High Priest Nebmaatre who was fairly certainly his son.13 Ramesses IXs second son Montuherkhopshef C perhaps this kings intended heir who did not live long enough to succeed his father took over the former KV19 tomb of Sethirkhepsef B in the Valley of the Kings.14 The throne was instead assumed by Ramesses X whose precise relationship to Ramesses IX is unclear. Ramesses X might have been Ramesses IXs son but this assumption remains unproven. Tomb KV19 which was one of the most beautifully decorated tombs in the royal valley had been abandoned by Sethirkhepsef B when the latter assumed the throne as king Ramesses VIII and one of prince Montuherkhopshefs depictions there bears the prenomen cartouche to Ramesses IX on its belt thereby establishing the identity of this princes father.15 The tomb of Ramesses IX KV6 has been open since antiquity as is evidenced by the presence of Roman and Greek graffiti on the tomb walls. It is quite long in the tradition of the syringe tunnels of the later 
19 th and 
20 th Dynasties and lies directly opposite the tomb of Ramesses II in the Valley of the Kings this fact may have influenced Ramesses IXs choice of location for his final resting place due to its proximity to this great Pharaoh.16 While Ramesses IXs chief queen is not precisely identified in surviving Egyptian inscriptions she was most likely Baketwernel.17 Burial and rediscoveryedit In 1881 the mummy of Ramesses IX nr. 5209 was found in the Deir elBahri cache DB320 within one of the two coffins of Neskhonswife of the Theban High Priest Pinedjem II.18 This pharaohs mummy was not apparently examined by Grafton Elliot Smith and not included in his 1912 catalogue of the Royal Mummies.19 When the mummy was unwrapped by Maspero a bandage was found from a year 5 mentioning the lady Neskhons most probably from the reign of king Siamun. A further strip of linen from a year 7 identified the mummy as Ra Khaemwaset which can be taken as a reference to either Ramesses Khaemwaset Meryamun IX or Ramesses Khaemwaset Meryamun Neterheqainu XI.20 But since an ivory box of Neferkare Ramesses IX was found in the royal cache itself and Ramesses XI was probably never buried at Thebes but rather in Lower Egypt the royal mummy is most likely to be that of Ramesses IX himself.21 It is estimated that the king was about 50 years old when he died but it is extremely difficult to correctly establish the age of mummies and his mummy was found to have broken limbs a broken neck and damage to its nose which is missing.22 In April 2021 his mummy was moved from the Egyptian Museum to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs Golden Parade. 23 In modern literatureedit The novel Ancient Evenings by Norman Mailer is told from the perspective of characters living during the reign of Ramesses IX including Ramesses IX himself. Most but not all of the novel takes place on one long evening in 1123 or 1122 BCE during which the characters including Ramesses IX tell stories of the past. The majority of the book concerns the reign of Ramesses II approximately 150 years before the night of the narrative the Battle of Kadesh 1274 BCE is in turn the central event of this subnarrative.
