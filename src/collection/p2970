31 st Dynasty or Dynasty 31 also known as the Second Egyptian Satrapy was effectively a satrapy of the Achaemenid Persian Empire between 343 BC to 332 BC. It was founded by Artaxerxes III the King of Persia after his reconquest of Egypt and subsequent crowning as Pharaoh of Egypt and was disestablished upon the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great. The period of the 
31 st Dynasty was the second occasion in which Persian pharaohs ruled Egypt hence the term Second Egyptian Satrapy. Before the 
31 st Dynasty was founded Egypt had enjoyed a brief period of independence during which three indigenous dynasties reigned the 
28 th 
29 th and 
30 th dynasties. The period before this is referred to as the First Egyptian Satrapy or the 
27 th Dynasty 525404 BC. Historyedit First Egyptian Campaignedit In around 351 BC Artaxerxes embarked on a campaign to recover Egypt which had revolted under his father Artaxerxes II. At the same time a rebellion had broken out in Asia Minor which being supported by Thebes threatened to become serious.5 Levying a vast army Artaxerxes marched into Egypt and engaged Nectanebo II. After a year of fighting the Egyptian Pharaoh Nectanebo inflicted a crushing defeat on the Persians with the support of mercenaries led by the Greek generals Diophantus and Lamius.6 Artaxerxes was compelled to retreat and postpone his plans to reconquer Egypt. Second Egyptian Campaignedit Artaxerxes III as Pharaoh satrapal coinage of Cilicia.7 The Svenigorodsky cylinder seal depicting a Persian king thrusting his lance at an Egyptian pharaoh while holding four other Egyptian captives on a rope.8910 In 343 BC Artaxerxes in addition to his 330000 Persians had now a force of 14000 Greeks furnished by the Greek cities of Asia Minor 4000 under Mentor consisting of the troops which he had brought to the aid of Tennes from Egypt 3000 sent by Argos and 1000 from Thebes. He divided these troops into three bodies and placed at the head of each a Persian and a Greek. The Greek commanders were Lacrates of Thebes Mentor of Rhodes and Nicostratus of Argos while the Persians were led by Rhossaces Aristazanes and Bagoas the chief of the eunuchs. Nectanebo II resisted with an army of 100000 of whom 20000 were Greek mercenaries. Nectanebo II occupied the Nile and its various branches with his large navy. The character of the country intersected by numerous canals and full of strongly fortified towns was in his favour and Nectanebo II might have been expected to offer a prolonged if not even a successful resistance. But he lacked good generals and overconfident in his own powers of command he found himself outmanoeuvered by the Greek mercenary generals. His forces were defeated by the combined Persian armies near Pelusium.11 Probable portrait of young Artaxerxes IV as Pharaoh wearing the Pharaonic crown.7 After his defeat Nectanebo hastily fled to Memphis leaving the fortified towns to be defended by their garrisons. These garrisons consisted of partly Greek and partly Egyptian troops between whom jealousies and suspicions were easily sown by the Persian leaders. As a result the Persians were able to rapidly defeat numerous towns across Lower Egypt and were advancing upon Memphis when Nectanebo decided to quit the country and flee southwards to Ethiopia.11 The Persian army then completely routed the Egyptians and occupied the Lower Delta of the Nile. Following Nectanebos flight to Ethiopia all of Egypt submitted to Artaxerxes. The Jews in Egypt were sent either to Babylon or to the south coast of the Caspian Sea the same location where the Jews of Phoenicia had earlier been sent.citation needed After this victory over the Egyptians Artaxerxes had the city walls destroyed started a reign of terror and set about looting all the temples. Persia gained a significant amount of wealth from this looting. Artaxerxes also imposed high taxes and attempted to weaken Egypt enough that it could never revolt against Persia again. During the 10 years that Persia controlled Egypt believers in the native religion were persecuted and sacred books were stolen.12 Before he returned to Persia he appointed Pherendares as satrap of Egypt. With the wealth gained from his reconquest of Egypt Artaxerxes was able to amply reward his mercenaries. He then returned to his capital having successfully completed his invasion and occupation of Egypt. Satrapal rule in Egyptedit Portrait of Sabaces Achaemenid satrap of Egypt from his coinage. Circa 340333 BC. Achaemenid Egypt. It is not known who served as satrap after Artaxerxes III but Pherendates II was an early satrap of Egypt. Under Darius III 336330 BC there was Sabaces who fought and died at Issus and was succeeded by Mazaces. Egyptians also fought at Issus for example the nobleman Somtutefnekhet of Heracleopolis who described on the Naples stele how he escaped during the battle against the Greeks and how Arsaphes the god of his city protected him and allowed him to return home. In 332 BC Mazaces handed over the country to Alexander the Great without a fight. The Achaemenid empire had ended and for a while Egypt was a satrapy in Alexanders empire. Later the Ptolemies and the Romans successively ruled the Nile valley. Cultureedit Egyptian man in a Persian costume c. 343332 BC accession number 
71.1 39 Brooklyn Museum.13 Occasionally Egyptians wore foreign costumes and jewelry. The taste for non Egyptian fashion arose during periods of extensive trade or diplomatic contact with distant courts or when Egypt was controlled by a foreign power. The Persians who twice invaded the Nile Valley from their West Asia homeland dominated Egypt during the Twentyseventh Dynasty 525 404 B.C.E. and the Thirtyfirst Dynasty 342332 B.C.E.. This statue dates to the later period of Persian rule in Egypt.13 According to the Brooklyn Museum The long skirt shown wrapped around this statues body and tucked in at the upper edge of the garment is typically Persian. The necklace called a torque is decorated with images of ibexes symbols in ancient Persia of agility and sexual prowess. The depiction of this official in Persian dress may have been a demonstration of loyalty to the new rulers.13 Coinageedit Achaemenid Egyptian coinageedit Coin of Satrap Sabakes in imitation of Athenian coinage.
