He was a prolific writer who published countless articles in journals such as Orientalia Gttinger Miszellen GM Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt JARCE Archiv fr Orientforschung AfO and Studien zur Altgyptischen Kultur SAK among others. Together with Kenneth Kitchen he is viewed as one of the foremost scholars on the New Kingdom and the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt. His many popular Germanlanguage publications include Handbuch der gyptischen Knigsnamen 
2 nd edition Mainz 1999 and Chronologie des Pharaonischen gypten or Chronology of the Egyptian Pharaohs MS 46 Philip von Zabern Mainz 1997 which is regarded by academics as one of the best and most comprehensive books on the chronology of Ancient Egypt and its various Pharaohs. In 1953 he personally inspected and recorded the Nile Quay Texts at Karnak before they were permanently lost or damaged through erosion. Academic contributionsedit Throughout his academic career Beckerath maintained a high scholarly standard in his publications and articles and dispelled many previously held assumptions or beliefs by meticulously analyzing the original evidence. For instance in a GM 154 1996 paper he examined and published a privately owned and poorly known stela which dated to Year 22 of Osorkon IIs reign and has frequently been called a Jubilee stela by academics GM 154 pp. 19. Beckerath revealed however that this document did not mention any Sed festival or Jubilee celebrations for Osorkon II in this year as one would have expected if he had indeed celebrated his massive Jubilee Feast at this time. Instead Beckerath demonstrated that the stelas text simply read Regnal Year 22 under the Majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Usermaatre Setepenamun i.e. Osorkon II son of Re the Appearance of the beloved Osorkon Meryamun in the presence of the deities Osiris Horus and Isis. GM 154 p. 20. Osorkon II is shown being blessed by these gods in the stela. In other words the document was just a perfectly ordinary stela depicting the king before this trinity of gods. Beckerath aptly notes that this new evidence casts serious doubt upon the idea that the damaged Sed Jubilee date in Osorkon IIs Bubastis Festival Hall should be read as Year 22 rather than Year 30 of this pharaohs reign the latter reading is possible with some restoration of the damaged numeral as Edward Wente noted in his 1976 JNES review of Kitchens TIPE book. Beckeraths analysis thus undermined the conventional view that this king celebrated his Sed Jubilee in his 
22 nd Year and suggests that Osorkon II likely celebrated his first Jubilee Feast in his 
30 th Year instead. Traditionally in Egypt Sed Jubilee Feasts were held on the 
30 th Year of a kings reign as is evidenced by the practices of other 
22 nd Dynasty kings such as Osorkon I Shoshenq III and Shoshenq V. In another article titled Zur Datierung des Papyrus Brooklyn 
16.2 05 in GM 140 1994 pp. 1517 Professor Beckerath argued that the 
49 th regnal year of a king referred to in Pap. Brooklyn 
16.2 05 which is generally ascribed to Shoshenq III of the 
22 nd Dynasty and comes from a mummy bandage from Deir elBahari should be dated to Year 49 of the 
21 st dynasty king Psusennes I instead because it is unlikely that private persons from Upper Egypt would refer to this late year of Shoshenq III.1 Shoshenq III is known to have lost effective control of Upper Egypt after his 
8 th Year when Pedubast I proclaimed himself king here. All mentions of Shoshenq III after his 
8 th Year in Upper Egypt are associated with the serving High Priest of Amun Osorkon B. After the 1993 discovery of a new Tanite king named Shoshenq IV who ruled Egypt for a minimum of 10 years in the 
13 year interval from Year 39 of Shoshenq III to Year 1 of Pami Kenneth Kitchen accepted von Beckeraths proposal in the introduction to the latest 1996 edition of his book The Third Intermediate Period of Egypt c. 1100650 BC. Kitchen writes that this new royal arrangement i.e. Shoshenq IIIShoshenq IVPami means that Papyrus Brooklyn 
16.2 05 of a Year 49 followed by a Year 4 must now be attributed to the time of Psusennes I and Amenemope not to Shoshenq III and Pimay. i.e. Pami cf. 103 83 below Kitchen TIPE 1996 p. xxvi. Beckerath also advocated the view that Shoshenq II enjoyed an independent reign at Tanis in his book Chronologie des Pharaonischen gypten. This view is seconded by Norbert Dautzenberg among other scholars. He died in June 2016 at the age of
