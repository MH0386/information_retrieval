3 JW.TJ late Egyptian Sywt adopted into the Coptic as Syowt2  sjowt which means Guardian of the northern approach of Upper Egypt.3 In GraecoRoman Egypt it was called Lycopolis or Lykopolis Greek    4 wolf city Lycon5 or Lyco.67 Ancient Asyutedit Statue of the chief royal scribe Yuny of Asyut and his wife Renenutet 12901270 BCE early Dynasty 19. Ancient Asyut was the capital of the Thirteenth Nome of Upper Egypt Lycopolites Nome around 3100 BC. It was located on the western bank of the Nile. The two most prominent gods of ancient Egyptian Asyut were Anubis and Wepwawet both funerary deities. During the First Intermediate Period the rulers of Zawty Khety I Tefibi and Khety II were supporters of the Herakleopolitan kings of whose domain the Nome formed the southern limits. The conflict between this Nome and the southern Nomes under the rule of the Eleventh Dynasty ended with the victory of Thebes and the decline of Asyuts importance. Skull of Khety from Asyut 1950 BCE. Lycopolis has no remarkable ruins but in the excavated chambers of the adjacent rocks mummies of wolves have been found confirming the origin of its name as well as a tradition preserved by Diodorus Siculus8 to the effect that an Ethiopian army invading Egypt was repelled beyond the city of Elephantine by packs of wolves. Osiris was worshipped under the symbol of a wolf at Lycopolis. According to a myth he had come from the shades as a wolf to aid Isis and Horus in their combat with Typhon.9 Other ancient Egyptian monuments discovered in Asyut include the Asyut necropolis west of the modern city tombs which date to dynasties Nine Ten and Twelve and the Ramessid tombs of Siese and Amenhotep. Asyut transliterated swt10 in hieroglyphs Era 
1 st Intermediate Period 21812055 BC In GraecoRoman times there was a distinct dialect of Coptic spoken in Asyut known as Lycopolitan after the Greek name for the city. Lesserused names for this dialect are SubAkhmimic and Assiutic. A large Byzantine Treasure was discovered near the city in the early twentieth century and is now dispersed amongst a number of museums in the West. The hoard is composed of some of the most elaborate jewellery to survive from late antiquity. Asyut was at the end of the 40 Day Road that connected the city to Darfur through the Selima and Kharga Oases. The history of the road known by local herders as Darb alArbain goes back over 700 years. It was used as a pathway for great caravans of up to 12000 camels at its peak in the 
14 th century.11 Modern Asyutedit Today the city of Asyut has almost 400000 inhabitants.12 It is the Egyptian city with one of the highest Coptic Christian concentrations of approximately

80 s.14 Coptic Catholic Eparchyedit On 10 August 1947 a Coptic Catholic eparchy Eastern Catholic Diocese of Assiut or Lycopolis was established on southern Egyptian territory split off from the Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Luqsor each suffragan of Coptic Catholic Patriarch of Alexandria. Its episcopal see is the cathedral of the Mother of Divine Love in Assyut.

It is the driest city of Egypt.16 Luxor Minya Qena and Asyut have the widest difference of temperatures between days and nights of any city in Egypt with almost 16 C 29 F difference. The city of Asyut is sandwiched between two mountain ranges of about 6
00 m height. There is also a lowering in elevation in mid Egypt from the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. This gives the city and nearby towns and villages the similar properties of a continental climate meaning that the city has harsh and chilly cold winter weather and very hot but nonhumid summers. During summer the temperature can exceed 42 C 108 F. Yet in winter Asyut gets below 0 C 32 F temperatures during the night and frost can easily form while hail or snow are rare because of the low average of the citys precipitation and general low humidity. The highest record temperature was 51 C 124 F recorded on July 23 1994 while the lowest record temperature was 2 C 28 F recorded on January 16 20
