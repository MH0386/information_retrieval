18 th Dynasty or Dynasty 18 is classified as the first dynasty of the New Kingdom of Egypt the era in which ancient Egypt achieved the peak of its power. The Eighteenth Dynasty spanned the period from 15501549 to 1292 BC. This dynasty is also known as the Thutmoside Dynasty1156 for the four pharaohs named Thutmose. Several of Egypts most famous pharaohs were from the Eighteenth Dynasty including Tutankhamun whose tomb was found by Howard Carter in 1922. Other famous pharaohs of the dynasty include Hatshepsut c. 1479 BC1458 BC the longestreigning woman pharaoh of an indigenous dynasty and Akhenaten c. 13531336 BC the heretic pharaoh with his Great Royal Wife Nefertiti. The Eighteenth Dynasty is unique among Egyptian dynasties in that it had two queens regnant women who ruled as sole pharaoh Hatshepsut and Neferneferuaten usually identified as Nefertiti.2 Historyedit Early Dynasty XVIIIedit AhmoseNefertari. AhmoseNefertari was the daughter of Seqenenre Tao a 
17 th dynasty king who rose up against the Hyksos. Her brother Ahmose expelled the Hyksos and she became queen of a united Egypt. She was deified after she died. Head of an Early Eighteenth Dynasty King depicting either Ahmose I Amenhotep I or Thutmose I c. 15391493 BC

8 E Brooklyn Museum Dynasty XVIII was founded by Ahmose I the brother or son of Kamose the last ruler of the 
17 th Dynasty. Ahmose finished the campaign to expel the Hyksos rulers. His reign is seen as the end of the Second Intermediate Period and the start of the New Kingdom. Ahmoses consort Queen AhmoseNefertari was arguably the most venerated woman in Egyptian history and the grandmother of the 
18 th Dynasty.3 She was deified after she died. Ahmose was succeeded by his son Amenhotep I whose reign was relatively uneventful.4 Amenhotep I probably left no male heir and the next pharaoh Thutmose I seems to have been related to the royal family through marriage. During his reign the borders of Egypts empire reached their greatest expanse extending in the north to Carchemish on the Euphrates and in the south up to Kanisah Kurgus beyond the fourth cataract of the Nile. Thutmose I was succeeded by Thutmose II and his queen Hatshepsut who was the daughter of Thutmose I. After her husbands death and a period of regency for her minor stepson who would later become pharaoh as Thutmose III Hatshepsut became pharaoh in her own right and ruled for over twenty years. Thutmose III who became known as the greatest military pharaoh ever also had a lengthy reign after becoming pharaoh. He had a second coregency in his old age with his son Amenhotep II. Amenhotep II was succeeded by Thutmose IV who in his turn was followed by his son Amenhotep III whose reign is seen as a high point in this dynasty. Amenhotep IIIs reign was a period of unprecedented prosperity artistic splendor and international power as attested by over 250 statues more than any other pharaoh and 200 large stone scarabs discovered from Syria to Nubia.5 Amenhotep III undertook large scale building programmes the extent of which can only be compared with those of the much longer reign of Ramesses II during Dynasty XIX.6 Amenhotep IIIs consort was the Great Royal Wife Tiye for whom he built an artificial lake as described on eleven scarabs.7 Akhenaten the Amarna Period and Tutankhamunedit Main article Amarna Period The Aten Akhenaten and his family adoring the Aten. Second from the left is Meritaten daughter of Akhenaten. Amenhotep III may have shared the throne for up to twelve years with his son Amenhotep IV. There is much debate about this proposed coregency with different experts considering that there was a lengthy coregency a short one or none at all. In the fifth year of his reign Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten njtn Effective for the Aten and moved his capital to Amarna which he named Akhetaten. During the reign of Akhenaten the Aten jtn the sun disk became first the most prominent deity and eventually came to be considered the only god.8 Whether this amounted to true monotheism continues to be the subject of debate within the academic community. Some state that Akhenaten created a monotheism while others point out that he merely suppressed a dominant solar cult by the assertion of another while he never completely abandoned several other traditional deities. Later Egyptians considered this Amarna Period an unfortunate aberration. After his death Akhenaten was succeeded by two shortlived pharaohs Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten of which little is known. In 1334 Akhenatens son Tutankhaten ascended to the throne shortly after he restored Egyptian polytheist cult and subsequently changed his name in Tutankhamun in honor to the Egyptian god Amun.9 His infant daughters 3

Ay may have married the widowed Great Royal Wife and young halfsister of Tutankhamun Ankhesenamun in order to obtain power she did not live long afterward. Ay then married Tey who was originally Nefertitis wetnurse. Ays reign was short. His successor was Horemheb a general during Tutankhamuns reign whom the pharaoh may have intended as his successor in case he had no surviving children which is what came to pass.10 Horemheb may have taken the throne away from Ay in a coup dtat. Although Ays son or stepson Nakhtmin was named as his fatherstepfathers Crown Prince Nakhtmin seems to have died during the reign of Ay leaving the opportunity for Horemheb to claim the throne next. Horemheb also died without surviving children having appointed his vizier Paramessu as his heir. This vizier ascended the throne in 1292 BC as Ramesses I and was the first pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty. This example to the right depicts a man named Ay who achieved the exalted religious positions of Second Prophet of Amun and High Priest of Mut at Thebes. His career flourished during the reign of Tutankhamun when the statue was made. The cartouches of King Ay Tutankhamuns successor appearing on the statue were an attempt by an artisan to update the sculpture.11 Relations with Nubiaedit The Eighteenth Dynasty empire conquered all of Lower Nubia under Thutmose I.12 By the reign of Thutmose III the Egyptians directly controlled Nubia to the Nile river 
4 th cataract with Egyptian influence  tributaries extending beyond this point.1314 The Egyptians referred to the area as Kush and it was administered by the Viceroy of Kush. The 
18 th dynasty obtained Nubian gold animal skins ivory ebony cattle and horses which were of exceptional quality.12 The Egyptians built temples throughout Nubia. One of the largest and most important temples was dedicated to Amun at Jebel Barkal in the city of Napata. This Temple of Amun was enlarged by later Egyptian and Nubian Pharaohs such as Taharqa.

The radiocarbon date range for its beginning is 15701544 BC the mean point of which is 1557 BC.18 Pharaohs of the

The dates and names in the table are taken from Dodson and Hilton.19 Many of the pharaohs were buried in the Valley of the Kings in Thebes designated KV. More information can be found on the Theban Mapping Project website.20 Several diplomatic marriages are known for the New Kingdom. These daughters of foreign kings are often only mentioned in cuneiform texts and are not known from other sources. The marriages were likely to have been a way to confirm good relations between these states.21 Dynasty XVIII Kings of Egypt Pharaoh Image Prenomen Throne name Horusname Reign Burial Consorts Comments Ahmose I  Ahmosis I Nebpehtire Aakheperu 15491524 BC Dra Abu elNaga AhmoseNefertari AhmoseHenuttamehu AhmoseSitkamose Amenhotep I Djeserkare Kauwaftau 15241503 BC Tomb ANB or KV39 AhmoseMeritamon Thutmose I Aakheperkare Kanakhtmerymaat 15031493 BC KV20 KV38 Ahmose Mutnofret Thutmose II Aakheperenre Kanakhtuserpehty 14931479 BC KV42 Hatshepsut Iset Hatshepsut Maatkare Useretkau 14791458 BC KV20 Thutmose II Thutmose III Menkheperenre Kanakhtkhaemwaset 14791425 BC KV34 Satiah MerytreHatshepsut Nebtu Menhet Menwi and Merti Amenhotep II Aakheperure Kanakhtwerpehty 14271397 BC KV35 Tiaa Thutmose IV Menkheperure Kanakhttutkhau 13971388 BC KV43 Nefertari Iaret Mutemwiya Daughter of Artatama I of Mitanni Amenhotep III Nebmaatre Kanakhtkhaemmaat 13881351 BC KV22 Tiye Gilukhipa of Mitanni Tadukhipa of Mitanni Sitamun Iset Daughter of Kurigalzu I of Babylon21 Daughter of KadashmanEnlil of Babylon21 Daughter of Tarhundaradu of Arzawa21 Daughter of the ruler of Ammia21 Amenhotep IVAkhenaten NeferkepherureWaenre Kanakhtqaishuti originally Meryaten later 13511334 BC Royal Tomb of Akhenaten KV55  Nefertiti Kiya Tadukhipa of Mitanni Daughter of atiya ruler of Eniasi21 Meritaten Meketaten Ankhesenamun Daughter of BurnaBuriash II King of Babylon21 Smenkhkare Ankhkheperure unknown 13351334 BC KV55  Meritaten Neferneferuaten AnkhkheperureAkhetenhyes unknown 13341332 BC Akhenaten Smenkhkare Usually identified as Queen Nefertiti Tutankhamun Nebkheperure Kanakhttutmesut 13321323 BC KV62 Ankhesenamun Ay Kheperkheperure Kanakhttjehenkhau 13231319 BC KV23 Ankhesenamun Tey Horemheb DjeserkheperureSetepenre Kanakhtsepedsekheru 13191292 BC KV57 Mutnedjmet Amenia Timeline of the

18 th Dynasty. From Thebes Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology London Ahmose I. Though he was called the founder of the 
18 th dynasty he was the brother of Kamose the last pharaoh of the 
17 th dynasty. During his reign he expelled the Hyksos from Lower Egypt and brought the Nile Delta under his control politically unifying Egypt once again. Amenhotep I gained the throne after his two elder brothers had died. He was the son of Ahmose and AhmoseNefertari. He was succeeded by Thutmose I who married his daughter Ahmose. Amenhotep I with his mother AhmoseNefertari. Both royals are credited with opening a workmens village at Deir elMedina. Deir elMedina housed the artisans and workers of the pharaohs tombs in the Valley of the Kings from the 
18 th to 
21 st dynasties. Amenhotep I and his mother were deified and were the villages principal gods. Thutmose I. A military man he came to power by marrying the sister of Amenhotep I or may have been his son to a secondary wife. During his reign he pushed the borders of Egypt into Nubia and the Levant. He is credited with the starting the building projects in what is now the temple of Karnak. Sketch from temple relief of Thutmose II. Considered a weak ruler he was married to his sister Hatshepsut. He named Thutmose III his son as successor but Thutmose III was too young to rule at his fathers death and thus his stepmother Hatshepsut was his regent. Hatshepsut and Thutmose II had a daughter Neferure. Hatshepsut. Daughter of Thutmose I she ruled jointly as her stepson Thutmose IIIs coregent. She soon took the throne for herself and declared herself pharaoh. While there were other female rulers and regents before her she is the only one who used the symbolic beard. Thutmosis III a military man and member of the Thutmosid royal line is commonly called the Napoleon of Egypt. His conquests of the Levant brought Egypts territories and influence to its greatest extent. He also built numerous monuments most famously his Festival Hall and botanical garden at Karnak and ordered the construction of the city of Napata in Nubia. Amenhotep II. Thutmose IV. Amenhotep III whose long reign over Egypt found it at the height of its imperial splendor. He built numerous monuments including the palace of Malqata the Colossi of Memnon and extensive expansions of the Temples of Karnak and Luxor and has more surviving statutes than any other ancient Egyptian monarch. Akhenaten initially Amenhotep IV began a religious revolution in which he declared Aten was a supreme god and turned his back on the old traditions. He moved the capital to Akhetaten. Queen Nefertiti possibly the daughter of Ay married Akhenaten. Her role in daily life at the court soon extended from Great Royal Wife to that of a coregent. It is also possible that she may have ruled Egypt in her own right as pharaoh Neferneferuaten. Queen Meritaten was the eldest daughter of Akhenaten and Nefertiti. She was the wife of Smenkhkare. She also may have ruled Egypt in her own right as pharaoh and is one of the possible candidates of being the pharaoh Neferneferuaten. Neferneferure and Neferneferuaten Tasherit. Shown here as children they were two of six daughters born to Akhenaten and Nefertiti. It is possible that Neferneferuaten Tasherit was the one who may have been her fathers coregent and may have ruled as the female pharaoh Neferneferuaten. Smenkhkare was a coregent of Akhenaten who ruled after his death. It was once believed that Smenkhkare was a male guise of Nefertiti however it is accepted that Smenkhkare was a male. He took Meritaten Queen Nefertitis daughter as his wife. Tutankhamun born Tutankhaten was Akhenatens son and the successor to Neferneferuaten. As pharaoh he instigated policies to restore Egypt to its old religion and moved the capital away from Akhetaten. Ay served as a high official to Akhenaten and a vizier to Tutankhamun. He may have been the father of Nefertiti. After the death of Tutankhamun Ay laid a claim to the throne by burying him and marrying Tutankhamuns wife Ankhesenamun. After the death of Ay Horemheb assumed the throne. A commoner he had served as a military official to both Tutankhamun and Ay. Horemheb instigated a policy of damnatio memoriae against everyone associated with the Amarna period. With no heir born to him he appointed his own vizier Paramessu as his successor. Tiye was the daughter of the court official Yuya. She married Amenhotep III and became his principal wife. Her knowledge of government helped her gain power in her position and she was soon running affairs of state and foreign affairs for her husband Amenhotep III and later her son Akhenaten. She was also Tutankhamuns grandmother. Senenu High Priest of Amun at Deir ElBari grinding grain c. 13521292 BC Limestone Brooklyn Museum.
