He was one of the Black Pharaohs who ruled over Egypt for nearly a century.56 Early lifeedit See also Twentyfifth Dynasty of Egypt family tree Taharqa may have been the son of Piye the Nubian king of Napata who had first conquered Egypt though the relationships in this family are not completely clear see Twentyfifth Dynasty of Egypt family tree. Taharqa was also the cousin and successor of Shebitku.7 The successful campaigns of Piye and Shabaka paved the way for a prosperous reign by Taharqa.

This stela records that an Apis bull born and installed fourth month of Season of the Emergence day 9 in year 26 of Taharqa died in Year 20 of Psamtik I 
4 th month of Shomu day 20 having lived 21 years. This would give Taharqa a reign of 26 years and a fraction in 690664 BC.9 Taharqa portrait Nubian Museum.10 Irregular accession to poweredit Taharqa explicitly states in Kawa Stela V line 15 that he succeeded his predecessor previously assumed to be Shebitku but now established to be Shabaka instead after the latters death with this statement I received the Crown in Memphis after the Falcon flew to heaven.11 The reference to Shebitku was an attempt by Taharqa to legitimise his accession to power.12 However Taharqa never mentions the identity of the royal falcon and completely omits any mention of Shabakas intervening reign between Shebitku and Taharqa possibly because he ousted Shabaka from power.13 In Kawa IV line 713 Taharqa states He Taharqa sailed northward to Thebes amongst the beautiful young people that His Majesty the late King ShabataqoShebitku had sent from Nubia. He was there in Thebes with him. He appreciated him more than any of his brothers. There here follows a description of the poor state of the temple of Kawa as observed by the prince. The heart of his Majesty was in sadness about it until his Majesty became king crowned as King of Upper and Lower Egypt .... It was during the first year of his reign he remembered what he had seen of the temple when he was young.14 Statue of Taharqa in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts In Kawa V line 15 Taharqa states I was brought from Nubia amongst the royal brothers that his Majesty had brought. As I was with him he liked me more than all his brothers and all his children so that he distinguished me. I won the heart of the nobles and was loved by all. It was only after the hawk had flown to heaven that I received the crown in Memphis.15 Therefore Taharqa says that King Shebitku who was very fond of him brought him with him to Egypt and during that trip he had the opportunity to see the deplorable state of the temple of Amun at Kawa an event he remembered after becoming king. But on Kawa V Taharqa says that sometime after his arrival in Egypt under a different king whom this time he chose not to name there occurred the death of this monarch Shabaka here and then his own accession to the throne occurred. Taharqas evasiveness on the identity of his predecessor suggests that he assumed power in an irregular fashion and chose to legitimise his kingship by conveniently stating the possible fact or propaganda that Shebitku favoured him more than all his brothers and all his children.12 Moreover in lines 13  14 of Kawa stela V His Majesty who can be none other but Shebitku is mentioned twice and at first sight the falcon or hawk that flew to heaven mentioned in the very next line 15 seems to be identical with His Majesty referred to directly before i.e. Shebitku.16 However in the critical line 15 which recorded Taharqas accession to power a new stage of the narrative begins separated from the previous one by a period of many years and the king or hawkfalcon that flew to heaven is conspicuously left unnamed in order to distinguish him from His Majesty Shebitku. Moreover the purpose of Kawa V was to describe several separate events that occurred at distinct stages of Taharqas life instead of telling a continuous story about it.16 Therefore the Kawa V text began with the 
6 th year of Taharqa and referred to the High Nile flood of that year before abruptly jumping back to Taharqas youth at the end of line 
13.1 6 In the beginning of line 15 Taharqas coronation is mentioned with the identity of the hawkfalconnow known to be Shabakaleft unnamed but if it was Shebitku Taharqas favourite king Taharqa would clearly have identified him and there is a description given of the extent of the lands and foreign countries under Egypts control but then in the middle of line 16 the narrative switches abruptly back again to Taharqas youth My mother was in TaSety . Now I was far from her as a twenty year old recruit as I went with His Majesty to the North Land.16 However immediately afterwards around the middle of line 17 the text jumps forward again to the time of Taharqas accession Then she came sailing downstream to see me after a long period of years. She found me after I had appeared on the throne of Horus....16 Hence the Kawa V narrative switches from one event to another and has little to no chronological coherence or value. Reignedit Kushite heartland and Kushite Empire of the 
25 th dynasty of Egypt under Taharqa17 Although Taharqas reign was filled with conflict with the Assyrians it was also a prosperous renaissance period in Egypt and Kush.1819 The empire flourished under Taharqa due in part to a particularly large Nile river flood abundant crops18 and the intellectual and material resources set free by an efficient central government.19 Taharqas inscriptions indicate that he gave large amounts of gold to the temple of Amun at Kawa.20 The Nile valley empire was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom.21 Taharqa and the 
25 th dynasty revived Egyptian culture.22 Religion arts and architecture were restored to their glorious Old Middle and New Kingdom forms. During Taharqas reign the central features of Theban theology were merged with Egyptian Middle and New Kingdom imperial ideology..19 Under Taharqa the cultural integration of Egypt and Kush reached such a point that it could not be reversed even after the Assyrian conquest.19 Portrait of Taharqa Kerma Museum Reconstruction with original colors Louvre Museum. Taharqa restored existing temples and built new ones. Particularly impressive were his additions to the Temple at Karnak new temple at Kawa and temples at Jebel Barkal.2223242526 Taharqa continued the 
25 th dynastys ambitious program to develop Jebel Barkal into a monumental complex of sancturies...centered around the great temple of...Amun.19 The similarity of Jebel Barkal to Karnak seems to be central to the builders at Jebel Barkal..19 The rest of Taharqas constructions served to create Temple Towns which were local centers of government production and redistribution.19 It was during the 
25 th dynasty that the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids many in modern Sudan since the Middle Kingdom.242728 Taharqa built the largest pyramid 52 meters square at base in the Nubian region at Nuri near ElKurru with the most elaborate Kushite rockcut tomb.29 Taharqa was buried with over 1070 shabtis of varying sizes and made of granite green ankerite and alabaster.30 War between Taharqa and Assyriaedit Main article Assyrian conquest of Egypt The Victory stele of Esarhaddon was created following the kings victory in Egypt and depicts Esarhaddon in a majestic pose with a war mace in his hand and royal captives kneeling before him. One is Ushankhuru the son of Taharqa shackled with a rope around his neck but wearing the Kushite crown. The other may be AbdiMilkutti King of Sidon. Taharqa began cultivating alliances with elements in Phoenicia and Philistia who were prepared to take a more independent position against Assyria.31 Taharqas army undertook successful military campaigns as attested by the list of conquered Asiatic principalities from the Mut temple at Karnak and conquered peoples and countries Libyans Shasu nomads Phoenicians Khor in Palestine from Sanam temple inscriptions.19 Torok mentions the military success was due to Taharqas efforts to strengthen the army through daily training in longdistance running as well as Assyrias preoccupation with Babylon and Elam.19 Taharqa also built military settlements at the Semna and Buhen forts and the fortified site of Qasr Ibrim.19 Imperial ambitions of the Mesopotamianbased Assyrian Empire made war with the 
25 th dynasty inevitable. In 701 BC the Kushites aided Judah and King Hezekiah in withstanding the siege of Jerusalem by King Sennacherib of the Assyrians 2 Kings 199 Isaiah 3
79.3 2 There are various theories Taharqas army33 disease divine intervention Hezekiahs surrender Herodotus mice theory as to why the Assyrians failed to take Jerusalem and withdrew to Assyria.34 Many historians claim that Sennacherib was the overlord of Khor following the siege in 701 BC. Sennacheribs annals record Judah was forced into tribute after the siege.35 However this is contradicted by Khors frequent utilization of an Egyptian system of weights for trade36 the 20 year cessation in Assyrias pattern before 701 and after Sennacheribs death of repeatedly invading Khor37 Khor paying tribute to Amun of Karnak in the first half of Taharqas reign19 and Taharqa flouting Assyrias ban on Lebanese cedar exports to Egypt while Taharqa was building his temple to Amun at Kawa.38 Statue of Pharaoh Taharqa from Jebel Barkal 
3.6  meters. National Museum of Sudan.39 In 679 BC Sennacheribs successor King Esarhaddon campaigned into Khor and took a town loyal to Egypt. After destroying Sidon and forcing Tyre into tribute in 677676 BC Esarhaddon invaded Egypt proper in 674 BC. Taharqa and his army defeated the Assyrians outright in 674 BC according to Babylonian records.40 This invasion which only a few Assyrian sources discuss ended in what some scholars have assumed was possibly one of Assyrias worst defeats.41 In 672 BC Taharqa brought reserve troops from Kush as mentioned in rock inscriptions.19 Taharqas Egypt still held sway in Khor during this period as evidenced by Esarhaddons 671 BC annal mentioning that Tyres King Balu had put his trust upon his friend Taharqa Ashkelons alliance with Egypt and Esarhaddons inscription asking if the KushiteEgyptian forces plan and strive to wage war in any way and if the Egyptian forces will defeat Esarhaddon at Ashkelon.42 However Taharqa was defeated in Egypt in 671 BC when Esarhaddon conquered Northern Egypt captured Memphis imposed tribute and then withdrew.18 Although the Pharaoh Taharqa had escaped to the south Esarhaddon captured the Pharaohs family including Prince NesAnhuret royal wives19 and most of the royal courtcitation needed which were sent to Assyria as hostages. Cuneiform tablets mention numerous horses and gold headdresses were taken back to Assyria.19 In 669 BC Taharqa reoccupied Memphis as well as the Delta and recommenced intrigues with the king of Tyre.18 Taharqa intrigued in the affairs of Lower Egypt and fanned numerous revolts.43 Esarhaddon again led his army to Egypt and on his death in 668 BC the command passed to Ashurbanipal. Ashurbanipal and the Assyrians again defeated Taharqa and advanced as far south as Thebes but direct Assyrian control was not established.18 The rebellion was stopped and Ashurbanipal appointed as his vassal ruler in Egypt Necho I who had been king of the city Sais. Nechos son Psamtik I was educated at the Assyrian capital of Nineveh during Esarhaddons reign.44 As late as 665 BC the vassal rulers of Sais Mendes and Pelusium were still making overtures to Taharqa in Kush.19 The vassals plot was uncovered by Ashurbanipal and all rebels but Necho of Sais were executed.19 The remains of three colossal statues of Taharqa were found at the entrance of the palace at Nineveh. These statues were probably brought back as war trophies by Esarhaddon who also brought back royal hostages and numerous luxury objects from Egypt.4546 Deathedit Taharqa died in the city of Thebes47 in 664 BC. He was followed by his appointed successor Tantamani a son of Shabaka who invaded Lower Egypt in hopes of restoring his familys control. This led to a renewed conflict with Ashurbanipal and the Sack of Thebes by the Assyrians in 663 BCE. He was himself succeeded by a son of Taharqa Atlanersa. Nuri pyramidedit The ruins of the pyramid of Taharqa at Nuri. It is the earliest and largest pyramid of the Nuri site. Main article Nuri Taharqa chose the site of Nuri in North Sudan to build his pyramid away from the traditional burial site of ElKurru. It was the first and the largest pyramid of Nuri and he was followed by close to twenty later kings at the site.48 Pyramids of the successors of Taharqa seen from the top of his pyramid at Nuri the first pyramid to be built and the largest at the site Biblical referencesedit Mainstream scholars agree that Taharqa is the Biblical Tirhakah Heb  king of Ethiopia Kush who waged war against Sennacherib during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah 2 Kings 199 Isaiah 3
79.4 933 The events in the biblical account are believed to have taken place in 701 BC whereas Taharqa came to the throne some ten years later. If the title of king in the biblical text refers to his future royal title he still may have been too young to be a military commander50 although this is disputed.51 According to the egyptologist Jeremy Pope Taharqa was probably between 25 and 33 years old in 701 BC and following Kushite custom to delegate actual leadership in combat to a subordinate was sent by his predecessor Shabako as a military commander to fight against the Assyrians.52 Aubin mentions that the biblical account in Genesis 1067 Table of Nations lists Taharqas predecessors Shebitku and Shabako  and .53 Concerning Taharqas successor the sack of Thebes was a momentous event that reverberated throughout the Ancient Near East. It is mentioned in the Book of Nahum chapter 3810 Profile of Taharqa on the Taharqa Shrine Ashmolean Museum Art thou better than populous No that was situate among the rivers that had the waters round about it whose rampart was the sea and her wall was from the sea Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength and it was infinite Put and Lubim were thy helpers. Yet was she carried away she went into captivity her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets and they cast lots for her honourable men and all her great men were bound in chains Depictionsedit Taharqa under the name Tearco the Aethiopian was described by the Ancient Greek historian Strabo. Strabo mentioned Taharqa in a list of other notable conquerors Cyrus the Great Xerxes Sesotris and mentioned that these princes had undertaken expeditions to lands far remote.54 Strabo mentions Taharqa as having Advanced as far as Europe55 and citing Megasthenes even as far as the Pillars of Hercules in Spain56 Similarly in 1534 the Muslim scholar IbnlKhattib alMakkary wrote an account of Taharqas establishment of a garrison in the south of Spain in approximately 702 BC.57 However Sesostris the Aegyptian he adds and Tearco the Aethiopian advanced as far as Europe and Nabocodrosor who enjoyed greater repute among the Chaldaeans than Heracles led an army even as far as the Pillars. Thus far he says also Tearco went. Strabo Geographia XV.
