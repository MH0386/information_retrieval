Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. Thats what were doing.  Jimmy Wales Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit and millions already have. Wikipedias purpose is to benefit readers by presenting information on all branches of knowledge.

Wikipedia currently has more than sixtytwo million articles in more than 300 languages including 6818600 articles in English with 122676 active contributors in the past month. Wikipedias fundamental principles are summarized in its five pillars. The Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines although editors do not need to be familiar with them before contributing. Anyone can edit Wikipedias text references and images. What is written is more important than who writes it. The content must conform with Wikipedias policies including being verifiable by published sources. Editors opinions beliefs personal experiences unreviewed research libelous material and copyright violations will not remain. Wikipedias software allows easy reversal of errors and experienced editors watch and patrol bad edits. Wikipedia differs from printed references in important ways. It is continually created and updated and encyclopedic articles on new events appear within minutes rather than months or years.

Its contributors enhance its articles quality and quantity and remove misinformation errors and vandalism.
