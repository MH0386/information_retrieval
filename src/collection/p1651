23 rd Dynasty or Dynasty 23 is usually classified as the third dynasty of the ancient Egyptian Third Intermediate Period. This dynasty consisted of a number of Meshwesh kings who ruled either as pharaohs or as independent kings of parts of Upper Egypt from 880 BC to 720 BC and pharaohs from 837 BC to 728 BC. Historyedit There is much debate surrounding this dynasty which may have been situated at Herakleopolis Magna Hermopolis Magna and Thebes. Monuments from their reign show that they controlled Upper Egypt in parallel with the Twentysecond dynasty shortly before the death of Osorkon II. While the Twentythird Dynasty is considered a Tanite dynasty as it originated from the city Tanis it never reigned from there. The Twentysecond Dynasty from Bubastis took over Tanis and Memphis and managed to retain these cities almost until the end of their Dynasty. As a result the Twentythird Dynasty being more or less an offshoot of the Twentysecond Dynasty originated from Tanis. Instead as mentioned above most historians argue that they used Leontopolis as their capital.1 This is confirmed by Piankhys stela which locates Iuput II in Leontopolis.2 However some historians argue that Iuput II should not be considered a Twentythird Dynasty king at all as it has not been undoubtedly proven that the Twentythird Dynasty ruled from Leontopolis merely that Iuput II ruled from somewhere in the Delta.3 If Iuput II is the only connection between the Twentythird Dynasty and Leontopolis this viewpoint would eliminate Piankhys stela as proof for Leontopolis being the capital of the Twentythird Dynasty. Another reason there is much debate is besides the conflicts between Lower and Upper Egypt that existed there were now also conflicts in the Delta itself. Part of these conflicts were succession struggles but another part involved the High Priests of Amun at Thebes who for a period during the Twentyfirst Dynasty effectively ruled Upper Egypt despite not being regarded as a separate dynasty however some did become pharaoh as part of a dynasty like Psusennes I. Although their power declined after the Twentyfirst Dynasty the High Priests of Amun remained powerful and influential and marriages into the royal family were not unusual.4 As a result multiple reigns within the Twentythird Dynasty as well as between the Twentysecond and Twentythird Dynasties overlap. This is because some members of the Twentythird Dynasty reigned as independent kings like Harsiese A and as a separate dynasty after Osorkon IIs of the Twentysecond Dynasty death. Some historians argue that the Twentythird Dynasty started with Takelot II and consider Pedubastis I as a separate independent and short lived part of that Dynasty. Others consider Takelot IIs line as a separate independent part of the Twentysecond Dynasty and consider Pedubastis Is short lived line as the Twentythird Dynasty.1 When Osorkon II died crown prince Shoshenq had already died so his younger brother Takelot II took the throne at Tanis. High priest of Amun at that moment in time was Nimlot Takelot IIs halfbrother. Nimlot was appointed by Osorkon II and Nimlot married his own daughter Karomama Merytmut II to Takelot II. As a result Nimlot would be the grandfather of any children and thus heirs to the throne Takelot II would get. When Nimlot died in the eleventh year of Takelot II5 a fight for the succession broke out. Takelot II chose prince Osorkon but Harsiese grandson of the chief priest did not agree. Thebes revolted at his hand but prince Osorkon managed to crush the revolt. This relative peace lasted four years as in Takelot IIs fifteenth year a civil war broke out. This conflict lasted for almost ten years and after another two years of relative peace the Thebans once again revolted. Takelot II died before this new conflict was resolved and with prince Osorkon far from Tanis his younger brother Shoshenq III seized power. While this helped in resolving the conflict with Thebes because they accepted Shoshenq III as king a new conflict started. Instead of a conflict between royal families this was from within the royal family. Prince Pedubastis proclaimed himself king and reigned from Leontopolis simultaneously with Shoshenq III.5 While prince Osorkon was usurped by his brother Shoshenq III Shoshenq did reappoint him as chief priest of Amun. Because Harsiese of the Theban revolt above disappeared in the twentyninth year of Shoshenq IIIs reign prince Osorkon effectively controlled Upper Egypt for about a decade as chief priest of Amun. Meanwhile Shoshenq III was and remained more powerful than the kings in Leontopolis. By this time Pedubastis and his son Iuput whom he had appointed as coregent had already died seemingly in the same year 804 BC. Shoshenq VI had succeeded Pedubastis1 but not for long as prince Osorkon succeeded him six years later as Osorkon III6 reigning simultaneously with Shoshenq III for the last years of his reign. At Herakleopolis a Twentysecond Dynasty king named Shoshenq V was still in power around 766 BC. However Osorkon III installed his eldest son Takelot there also allowing him to be chief priest of Amun at the same time. As a result the Twentysecond Dynastys role in the Theban area was greatly reduced. When Osorkon III died Takelot had been his fathers1 coregent and was thus now sole ruler.5 Takelot III had given up his role as chief priest when he became pharaoh and his sister Shepenwepet I seems to have taken over that role as well as being appointed as Divine Adoratrice of Amun. As a result she effectively ruled over the Theban region with her brother. Takelot III also gave up his rule of Herakleopolis to Peftjauawhybastet who was married to a daughter of Rudamon Takelots brother. Rudamon succeeded Takelot III but shortly after was succeeded by Iuput II also known as IniIny. Under his reign the region became more divided again as Peftjauawybastet and Nimlot governor of Hermopolis adopted royal titles. Rudamon and Iuput II only reigned over Thebes in the final phase of the Twentythird Dynasty as Piankhy king of Napata put an end to the socalled Libyan anarchy.5 Pharaohs and Kings of the
