15 th Maaibre Sheshi also Sheshy was a ruler of areas of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period. The dynasty chronological position duration and extent of his reign are uncertain and subject to ongoing debate. The difficulty of identification is mirrored by problems in determining events from the end of the Middle Kingdom to the arrival of the Hyksos in Egypt. Nonetheless Sheshi is in terms of the number of artifacts attributed to him the bestattested king of the period spanning the end of the Middle Kingdom and the Second Intermediate period roughly from c. 1800 BC until 1550 BC. Hundreds of scaraboid seals bearing his name have been found throughout the Levant Egypt Nubia and as far away as Carthage where some were still in use 1500 years after his death. Three competing hypotheses have been put forth for the dynasty to which Sheshi belonged. The first hypothesis is supported by Egyptologists such as Nicolas Grimal William C. Hayes and Donald B. Redford who believe that he should be identified with Salitis founder of the 
15 th Dynasty according to historical sources and king of the Hyksos during their invasion of Egypt. Salitis is credited with 19 years of reign and would have lived sometime between c. 1720 BC and 1650 BC. The second hypothesis is supported by Egyptologist William Ayres Ward and the archaeologist Daphna BenTor who propose that Sheshi was a Hyksos king and belongs to the second half of the 
15 th Dynasty reigning between Khyan and Apophis. Alternatively Manfred Bietak has proposed that Sheshi was a vassal of the Hyksos ruling over some part of Egypt or Canaan. The very existence of such vassals is debated. The final hypothesis says Sheshi could be a ruler of the early 
14 th Dynasty a line of kings of Canaanite descent ruling over of the Eastern Nile Delta immediately before the arrival of the Hyksos. Proponents of this theory such as Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker credit Sheshi with 40 years of reign starting ca. 1745 BC. Ryholt proposed that Sheshi allied his kingdom with the Kushites in Nubia via a dynastic marriage with the Nubian princess Tati. Ryholt further posits that the son of Sheshi and Tati was Nehesy whose name means The Nubian whom he believes succeeded Sheshi to the throne as the pharaoh Nehesy Aasehre. Attestationsedit Nomen and prenomen on sealsedit The nomen of Sheshinote 4 is inscribed on over two hundred scarab seals which constitute the sole attestations of his reign. The number of scarabs attributed to Sheshi is paralleled in number only by those bearing the prenomen Maaibre9 meaning The righteous one is the heart of Ra.7 Based on the close stylistic similarities between both groups of scarabs as well as their otherwise unmatched numbers10 the consensus among Egyptologists is that Maaibre was the prenomen of Sheshi.8911 Provenance of some of the scarabs of Maaibre Sheshi12 Consequently Maaibre Sheshi is the best attested ruler of the Second Intermediate Period in terms of the number of artefacts attributed to him with 396 seals and two seal impressions showing his nomen or prenomen.13 This figure is three times higher than the 123 seals attributed to the next best attested king of the period Yakbim Sekhaenre.note 514 In addition to these seals Manfred Bietak has suggested that a scarab discovered in Avaris and inscribed with the name of a king Shenshek should probably be attributed to Sheshi.15 This conclusion is rejected by Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker who believe that Shenshek was a separate king.1617 Location of the findsedit Over 80 percent of the seals attributed to Maaibre Sheshi are of unknown provenancenote 6 but the remaining 20 percent have been found throughout Egypt Nubia and Canaan indicating widespread trade and diplomatic contacts during Sheshis reign.19 Important finds include seals from Lachish Gezer Jericho Tel Michal20 Amman and Tell elAjjul21 in Canaan. In Lower Egypt three seals have been unearthed in Tell elYahudiya and Tell elMashkuta and a further eight are from the wider Delta region.22 Four seals originate from Saqqara23 and a further five from the Middle Egyptian sites of Abusir elMelek Kom Medinet Ghurab Kom elAhmar and Deir Rifa. To the south in Upper Egypt a total of twenty seals are known from Abydos Hu Thebes Elephantine Esna and Edfu24 In Nubia seals of Sheshi have been found in the Egyptian fortresses of Uronarti and Mirgissa and otherwise in Dakka Kerma Sayala Aniba Masmas Faras Ukma Akasha and Sai.18 Finally two seal impressions of Sheshi have been found in Carthage2526 in a context dated archeologically to the 
2 ndcentury BC.27 The seals of Sheshi are now scattered in many different museums including the Israel Museum28 Petrie Museumnote 730 Ashmolean British Museum Louvre Walters Art Museum31 Metropolitan Museum of Art32 and the Egyptian Museum of Cairo.33 Historical sourcesedit No historical attestation of Sheshi is known for certain. Sheshi is absent from the Turin canon a list of kings written on papyrus during the Ramesside period and which serves as the primary historical source for the Second Intermediate Period.34 This is because the section of the papyrus covering the 
13 th to 
17 th Dynasties is heavily damaged35 and the problem of Sheshis chronological position cannot be resolved from the document. It is unclear whether Sheshi is mentioned in the Aegyptiaca a history of Egypt written in the 
3 rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II 283246 BC by the Egyptian priest Manetho. Indeed the Aegyptiaca only reports Hellenized names for Egyptian pharaohs and the identification of Sheshi with any particular name remains controversial.36 Finally Aharon Kempinski and Donald B. Redford have proposed that Sheshi is the historical figure who gave rise to the Biblical Sheshai one of the Anakim living in Hebron at the time of the conquest of Canaan by the Hebrews according to Numbers 13
22.3 738 David Rohl goes even further and explicitly equates Sheshi with Sheshai.39 Dynastyedit Seal reading the Son of Ra Sheshi living for ever Walters Art Museum40 Three competing hypotheses have been proposed regarding the dynasty to which Sheshi belonged. Hyksos ruleredit William C. Hayes Nicolas Grimal Redford and Peter Clayton identify Sheshi with Salitis also known as Saites.341424344 According to the Aegyptiaca Salitis was the founder of the Hyksos 
15 th Dynasty.45 Alternatively Bietak and Janine Bourriau have proposed that Salitis should be identified with SakirHar46 a poorly known ruler of the Second Intermediate Period who in contrast to Sheshi47 is known to have borne the title of Hyksos.48 If Sheshi is to be equated with Salitis then the seals of Sheshi discovered in Nubia suggest that the Hyksos allied themselves with the Nubians against the native Egyptian 
13 th Dynasty as soon as they arrived in the Nile Delta42 an event which Grimal places at c. 1720 BC.42 Grimal envisions Sheshis kingdom as comprising the entire Nile Delta and the Nile valley north of Gebelein. According to Manetho as reported by Josephus in Against Apion49 Salitis reigned from Memphis850 and fortified the existing town of Avaris51 which was to become the Hyksos seat of power.43 Grimal and Hayes further equate Sheshi with Sharek42 a king whose sole attestation is found on a stone slab detailing the genealogy of Ankhefensekhmet a priest who lived at the end of the 
22 nd Dynasty c. 750 BC some 900 years after Sheshis estimated lifetime.note 852 William Ayres Ward and the archaeologist Daphna BenTor rely on seriations of the seals of Sheshi and other kings of the Second Intermediate Period to date Sheshi to the second half of the 
15 th Dynasty between the great Hyksos pharaohs Khyan and Apophis.5354 Vassal of the Hyksosedit Jrgen von Beckerath is less assertive about Sheshis identity and assigns him to his combined 
15 th
16 th Dynasty where he regroups Hyksos rulers whose chronological position is uncertain together with kings whom he sees as vassals of the Hyksos.55 Von Beckeraths analysis relies on the hypothesis that Manethos 
16 th Dynasty comprised minor rulers of the Nile Delta region called lesser Hyksos who served the great Hyksos kings of the 
15 th Dynasty such as Khyan and Apophis.56 For Manfred Bietak the large number of attestations of Sheshi suggests that he was an important Hyksos ruler8 yet his inclusion in the 
15 th Dynasty may be doubtful given the total absence of monuments attributable to him.57 Thus Bietak concludes that Sheshi should be placed in a group of West Semitic rulers who coexisted with the 
15 th Dynasty possibly as vassals or partly independently from it and some of whom even bore the title of Hyksos.58 The existence of lesser Hyksos kings in Egypt is currently debated.59 Ryholt has shown that a statement in Eusebius epitome of the Aegyptiaca indicating that the Hyksos had vassals contains a corruption of Manethos original text.5960 Thus he rejects the hypothesis that the 
16 th Dynasty comprised vassals of the Hyksos and maintains instead that it was a native Egyptian dynasty independently reigning over the Theban region between the fall of the 
13 th Dynasty and the advent of the 
17 th Dynasty.61 These conclusions on the 
16 th Dynasty have been accepted by many scholars including BenTor James Peter Allen Susan Allen62 Baker and Redford.63 Yet for both Redford64 and Bietak without doubt there were under the umbrella of the fifteenth dynasty rulers a series of vassals in southern and coastal Palestine in Middle Egypt and in Thebes. ... Such was the political system of the Hyksos and typical of the Amorite kingdoms in Syria and the citystates in Palestine.58 King of the 
14 th Dynastyedit Seal reading the son of Ra Sheshi living forever Walters Art Museum.65 Ryholt and Baker reject the identification of Sheshi as a 
15 th Dynasty ruler.6667 Ryholt observes that early Hyksos kings such as SakirHar and Khyan are known to have adopted the title Heqa khasewet meaning ruler of the foreign landsnote 9 a title which Sheshi did not bear.47 In addition the later of these two kings Khyan only adopted an Egyptian prenomen during the second half of his reigna practice that was followed by subsequent Hyksos kings.47 In contrast if Sheshi is to be identified with Maaibre then Sheshi bore a prenomen. This implies either that he was a Hyksos king reigning after Khyan in contradiction with Khyans known successors Apophis and Khamudi and the fact that Sheshi did not bear the title of Heqa khasewet69 or that he belonged to another dynasty.47 Consequently Ryholt suggests that Sheshi was actually a 
14 th Dynasty ruler5 the 
14 th Dynasty being a line of kings of Canaanite descent possibly ruling over the Eastern Nile Delta immediately before the arrival of the Hyksos 
15 th Dynasty. Many Egyptologists accept the existence of the 
14 th Dynasty based on archaeological evidence7071 and on the fact that about 50 kings are recorded in the Turin canon between the 
13 th Dynasty and the later Hyksos rulers.7172 On the other hand Redford proposed that these 50 kings constitute the genealogy of the Hyksos rulers and that the 
14 th Dynasty is chimerical.73 Based on a seriation of the scarab seals of the Second Intermediate Period available in 1900 AD George Willoughby Fraser was able to date Sheshis reign to a short dynasty before the Hyksos invasion. More recently Ryholt obtained a similar result using his own seriation74 and places Sheshi before YaqubHar and the great Hyksos rulers Khyan and Apophis and after Yakbim Sekhaenre Yaammu Nubwoserre Qareh Khawoserre and Ammu Ahotepre.75 Rolf Krauss independently reached the same conclusion.76 Given that the earliest 
14 th Dynasty ruler mentioned on the Turin canon is Nehesy a king who left several attestations of his reign in the Delta region and that there is only space for one predecessor for Nehesy on the canon Ryholt concludes that the earlier document from which the canon was copied had a lacuna preceding Nehesy.77 Such lacunae are noted as wsf on the canon and could cover any number of kings.note 1079 Thus Ryholt sees no obstacle with having Sheshi succeed Ammu Ahotepre and immediately precede Nehesy.5 Datingedit Scarab of Sheshi reading The good god Maaibre given life.80 Mid
18 th century BCedit Ryholt dates Sheshis reign to the mid
18 th century BC. His main argument is the presence of seals of Sheshi and of two kings of the mid 
13 th Dynasty Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw and Djedkheperew in the Egyptian fort of Uronarti in Nubia. The fort of Uronarti was abandoned at some point in the 
13 th Dynasty an event which Ryholt dates to the reign of Djedkheperew given the lack of seals attributable to subsequent kings. Ryholt thus proposes that Sheshi reigned from c. 1745 BC until 1705 BC and was a contemporary of Khabaw and Djedkheperew.5 Ryholts hypothesis regarding Sheshi comes with his dating the start of the 
14 th Dynasty around 1805 BC5 over 90 years earlier than accepted by most Egyptologists.note 1182 They propose instead that the 
14 th Dynasty emerged during the two decades of Merneferre Ays reign83 which is dated to between 1700 BC5 and 1660 BC depending on the scholar.84 Ay is the last 
13 th Dynasty pharaoh to be attested in Lower Egypt and most scholars therefore contend that he abandoned Itjtawy the capital of Egypt since the reign of Amenemhat I c. 1980 BC in favor of Thebes as he lost control of the Delta region to the 
14 th Dynasty.note 128387 Mid to late
17 th century BCedit If Sheshi is to be identified with Salitis the founder of the 
15 th Dynasty according to Manetho then he would have lived around 1650 BC the date agreed upon by most Egyptologists including Ryholt for the arrival of the Hyksos in Egypt.8889909192 If Sheshi lived during the second half of the 
15 th Dynasty between the reigns of Khyan and Apophis as BenTor and Ward favor5393 then Sheshi would have reigned c. 1600 BC.88 Reign lengthedit The Egyptologists identifying Sheshi with Salitis follow Josephus Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius who report that Manetho credited Salitis with 19 years of reign in his Aegyptiaca.445 Ryholt relies instead on a statistical method and estimates the duration of Sheshis reign to have been between 20 and 53 years. The method consists in tallying the seals of Yakbim Sekhaenre Yaammu Nubwoserre Qareh Khawoserre and Ammu Ahotepre with those of Sheshi. Then knowing that the first four of these kings reigned for at least 30 yearsnote 1396 implies that they have left between 
7.5  and 20 seals per year while on throne. Consequently Sheshis nearly 400 scarabs would correspond to 20 to 53 years96 which Ryholt gives as about 40 years.97 Familyedit Ryholt proposes that Sheshi had at least two consorts Tati with whom he fathered his successor pharaoh Nehesy and an unknown queen with whom he fathered a prince Ipqu.98 Ryholt reached this conclusion on noting that scarabs of queen Tati and Princes Ipqu and Nehesy bear stylistic markers which are found on those of Sheshi and thus that they must have been contemporaries.99 In addition Tati is attested as a feminine Nubian name in earlier execration texts98 which would explain the peculiar name of Nehesy meaning the Nubian. For Ryholt Sheshis motivation behind a dynastic marriage with a Kushite princess was to ally his kingdom with the Nubians.100 Ryholts hypothesis concerning Nehesy may be vindicated by a number of scarabs giving Nehesy the titles of kings son and of eldest king son indicating that Nehesys father was a king as well. In addition both Nehesy and Ipqu bore the titles of kings son of Ra a conflation of the titles son of Ra and kings son which could indicate that they were appointed junior coregents by Sheshi.101 These conclusions are shared by Baker102 but rejected by BenTor who argues not only that Nehesy reigned before Sheshi but also that the Nehesy referred to as kings son was a later Hyksos prince. In 2005 a stele of Nehesy was discovered in the fortress city of Tjaru the starting point of the Way of Horus the major road leading out of Egypt into Canaan. The stele shows a kings son Nehesy offering oil to the god Banebdjedet and also bears an inscription mentioning the kings sister Tany. A woman with this name and title is known from other sources around the time of the Hyksos pharaoh Apophis c. 1570 BC.103 This suggests that the kings son Nehesy of the stela lived c. 1570 BC as well over 100 years after King Nehesys estimated lifetime. This could be confirmed by BenTors observation that the scarabs referring to the kings son Nehesy are different in style from those referring to king Nehesy. In this situation the kings son Nehesy would be a Hyksos prince different from the betterknown king Nehesy.104 Notes references and sourcesedit Notesedit  William C. Hayes gives the reign of Sheshi as three years c. 1675 BC.2  Identifying Sheshi with SalitisSaites3 founder of the 
15 th Dynasty according to the Aegyptiaca.4  Ryholt dates the reign of Sheshi to 17451705 BC.5  The meaning of Sheshi is uncertain it could be the diminutive of another name.8  The dynasty and chronological position of Yakbim Sekhaenre are highly uncertain.14  On the 396 seals of Sheshi catalogued by Ryholt 325 are of unknown provenancehaving possibly been dug up illegally.18  The Petrie Museum houses over 25 seals with catalog numbers UC 11682 11683 11684 11685 11986 11687 11688 11689 11690 11692 11693 11694 11695 11696 11697 11698 11699 11700 11701 11702 11703 11704 11705 11706 11825 and 165
95.2 9  Shareks existence is doubted by Ryholt.52  This title is also often rendered as Hekachasut from the Egyptian q
33 swt.68  Ryholts theory concerning the meaning of wsf on the Turin canon has been accepted by other scholars including Allen and BenTor.78  The 
14 th dynasty is traditionally dated to 17101650 BC.81  Most Egyptologists consider Nehesy to have been either the founder85 or the second king of this dynasty.86  This 30 year figure is strongly dependent on Ryholts controversial reconstruction of the early 
14 th Dynasty. First Ryholt uses a seriation of the seals of Yakbim Yaammu Qareh and Ammu to posit that they were Sheshis predecessors94 a conclusion rejected by S. and J. Allen and BenTor.95 Then Ryholt observes that the abandonment of the Egyptian fortress at Uronarti suggests that Sheshi and Djedkheperew were contemporaries something which is also contested by Allen Allen and BenTor.95 Finally Ryholt uses his reconstruction of the 
13 th Dynasty to date Djedkheperews reign to c. 1770 leaving around 30 years for Sheshis four predecessors.96 Referencesedit  Walters Art Museum 2015 Online catalog Seal 29621.
