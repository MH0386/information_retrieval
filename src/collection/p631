24 th century BC for the Egyptian pharaoh Unas the ninth and final king of the Fifth Dynasty.
9 a It is the smallest Old Kingdom pyramid but significant due to the discovery of Pyramid Texts spells for the kings afterlife incised into the walls of its subterranean chambers. Inscribed for the first time in Unass pyramid the tradition of funerary texts carried on in the pyramids of subsequent rulers through to the end of the Old Kingdom and into the Middle Kingdom through the Coffin Texts that form the basis of the Book of the Dead. Unas built his pyramid between the complexes of Sekhemket and Djoser in North Saqqara. Anchored to the valley temple at a nearby lake a long causeway was constructed to provide access to the pyramid site. The causeway had elaborately decorated walls covered with a roof which had a slit in one section allowing light to enter illuminating the images. A long wadi was used as a pathway. The terrain was difficult to negotiate and contained old buildings and tomb superstructures. These were torn down and repurposed as underlay for the causeway. A significant stretch of Djosers causeway was reused for embankments. Tombs that were on the path had their superstructures demolished and were paved over preserving their decorations. Two Second Dynasty tombs presumed to belong to Hotepsekhemwy Nebra and Ninetjer from seals found inside are among those that lie under the causeway. The site was later used for numerous burials of Fifth Dynasty officials private individuals from the Eighteenth to Twentieth Dynasties and a collection of Late Period monuments known as the Persian tombs. The causeway joined the temple in the harbour with the mortuary temple on the east face of the pyramid. The mortuary temple was entered on its east side through a large granite doorway seemingly constructed by Unass successor Teti. Just south of the upper causeway are two long boat pits. These may have contained two wooden boats the solar barques of Ra the sun god. The temple was laid out in a similar manner to Djedkare Isesis. A transverse corridor separates the outer from the inner temple. The entry chapel of the inner temple has been completely destroyed though it once contained five statues in niches. A feature of the inner temple was a single quartzite column that was contained in the antichambre carre. The room is otherwise ruined. Quartzite is an atypical material to use in architectural projects though examples of it being used sparingly in the Old Kingdom exist. The material is associated with the sun cult due to its sunlike coloration. The underground chambers remained unexplored until 1881 when Gaston Maspero who had recently discovered inscribed texts in the pyramids of Pepi I and Merenre I gained entry. Maspero found the same texts inscribed on the walls of Unass pyramid their first known appearance. The 283 spells in Unass pyramid constitute the oldest smallest and best preserved corpus of religious writing from the Old Kingdom. Their function was to guide the ruler through to eternal life and ensure his continued survival even if the funerary cult ceased to function. In Unass case the funerary cult may have survived the turbulent First Intermediate Period and up until the Twelfth or Thirteenth Dynasty during the Middle Kingdom. This is a matter of dispute amongst Egyptologists where a competing idea is that the cult was revived during the Middle Kingdom rather than having survived until then. Location and excavationedit The pyramid is situated on the Saqqara plateau and lies on a line running from the pyramid of Sekhemkhet to the pyramid of Menkauhor.18 The site required the construction of an exceptionally long causeway to reach a nearby lake suggesting the site held some significance to Unas.19 The pyramid was briefly examined by John Shae Perring and soon after by Karl Richard Lepsius who listed the pyramid on his pioneering list as number XXXV.4 Entry was first gained by Gaston Maspero who examined its substructure in 18
81.4 20 He had recently discovered a set of texts in the pyramids of Pepi I and Merenre I. Those same texts were discovered in Unass tomb making this their earliest known appearance.4 From 1899 to 1901 the architect and Egyptologist Alessandro Barsanti conducted the first systematic investigation of the pyramid site succeeding in excavating part of the mortuary temple as well as a series of tombs from the Second Dynasty and the Late Period.21 Later excavations by Cecil Mallaby Firth from 1929 until his death in 1931 followed by those of the architect JeanPhilippe Lauer from 1936 to 1939 were conducted with little success. The archaeologists Selim Hassan Muhammed Zakaria Goneim and A. H. Hussein mainly focused on the causeway leading to the pyramid while conducting their investigations from 1937 to 1949. Hussein discovered a pair of limestonelined boat pits at the upper end of the causeway. In the 19
70 s Ahmad Moussa excavated the lower half of the causeway and the valley temple.22 Moussa and another archaeologist Audran Labrousse fr conducted an architectural survey of the valley temple from 1971 to 19
81.2 3 The pyramids of Unas Teti Pepi I and Merenre were the subjects of a major architectural and epigraphic project in Saqqara led by Jean Leclant.24 From 1999 until 2001 the Supreme Council of Antiquities conducted a major restoration and reconstruction project on the valley temple. The three entrances and ramps were restored and a low limestone wall built to demarcate the temples plan.23 Mortuary complexedit Layoutedit Layout of Unass complex Unass complex is situated between the pyramid of Sekhemkhet and the southwest corner of the pyramid complex of Djoser. It is in symmetry with the pyramid of Userkaf situated at the northeast corner in Saqqara.25 Old Kingdom mortuary complexes consist of five essential components 1 a valley temple 2 a causeway 3 a mortuary temple 4 a cult pyramid and 5 the main pyramid.26 Unass monument has all of these elements the main pyramid constructed six steps high from limestone blocks22 a valley temple situated in a natural harbour at the mouth of a wadi5 a causeway constructed using the same wadi as a path5 a mortuary temple similar in layout to that of Unass predecessor Djedkare Isesis27 and a cult pyramid in the south of the mortuary temple.28 The pyramid mortuary temple and cult pyramid were enclosed by a 7 m 23 ft 13 cu tall perimeter wall.29 The perimeter wall from the northeast to northwest corner is about 86 m 282 ft 164 cu long and stretches 76 m 249 ft 145 cu from north to south.30 Main pyramidedit Remains of the outer casing on Unass pyramid Though Unass reign lasted for around thirty to thirtythree years11 his pyramid was the smallest built in the Old Kingdom.4 Time constraints cannot be considered a factor explaining the small size and it is more likely that resource accessibility constrained the project.22 The monuments size was also inhibited due to the extensive quarrying necessary to increase the size of the pyramid. Unas chose to avoid that additional burden and instead kept his pyramid small.31 The core of the pyramid was built six steps high constructed with roughly dressed limestone blocks which decreased in size in each step.22 The construction material for the core would ideally have been locally sourced.3233 This was then encased with fine white limestone blocks34 quarried from Tura.35 Some of the casing on the lowest steps has remained intact.27 The pyramid had a base length of 
57.7 5 m 1
89.5  ft 1
10.2 1 cu converging towards the apex at an angle of approximately 56 giving it a height of 43 metres 141 ft 82 cu on completion.36 The pyramid had a total volume of 47390 m3 61980 cu yd.7 The pyramid was smoothsided.373839 The pyramid has since been ruined4 as have all others of the Fifth Dynasty40 a result of its poor construction and materials.41 The pyramids of the Fifth Dynasty were further systematically dismantled during the New Kingdom to be reused in the construction of new tombs.42 Unas abandoned the practice of building pyramids for his consorts43 instead Khenut and Nebet were buried in a double mastaba northeast of the main pyramid.44 Each queen was accorded separate rooms and an individual entrance though the layout of the tombs is identical. Khenut owned the western half and Nebet owned the eastern half. Their chambers were extensively decorated.45 The chapel for Nebets mastaba contains four recesses. One bears a cartouche of Unass name indicating that it may have contained a statue of the king whereas the others contained statues of the queen.46 Directly north of the mastaba were the tombs for Unass son Unasankh and daughter Iput. Another daughter Hemetre was buried in a tomb west of Djosers complex.47 Substructureedit Layout of Unas substructure. Materials colourcoded light orange  fine white limestone red  red granite white  white alabaster grey  greywacke. A small chapel called the north chapel or entrance chapel4836 was situated adjacent to the pyramids north face. It consisted of a single room with an altar and a stela bearing the hieroglyph for offering table. Only trace elements of the chapel remain.27 These chapels had a false door and a decoration scheme similar to the offering hall which the archaeologist Dieter Arnold suggests indicates that the chapel was a miniature offering chapel.48 The entrance into the substructure of the pyramid lay under the chapels pavement.2736 The substructure of the pyramid is similar to that of Unass predecessor Djedkare Isesi.27 The entry leads into a 
14.3 5 m 
47.1  ft long vertically sloping corridor inclined at 22 that leads to a vestibule at its bottom.4922 The vestibule is

10.1  ft containing the rulers sarcophagus.2753 The roof of both the antechamber and burial chamber were gabled in a similar fashion to earlier pyramids of the era.27 Modern entrance to the pyramid substructures bottom left Near the burial chambers west wall sat Unass coffin made from greywacke rather than basalt as was originally presumed.2758 The coffin was undamaged but its contents had been robbed.59 A canopic chest had once been buried at the foot of the southeast corner of the coffin.27 Traces of the burial are fragmentary all that remain are portions of a mummy including its right arm skull and shinbone as well as the wooden handles of two knives used during the opening of the mouth ceremony.27 The mummy remains have been displayed in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo.36 The walls of the chambers were lined with Tura limestone60 while those surrounding Unass sarcophagus3661 were sheathed in white alabaster incised and painted to represent the doors of the royal palace facade complementing the eastern passage.2762 Taken as symbolically functional these allowed the king to depart the tomb in any direction.63 The ceiling of the burial chamber was painted blue with gold stars to resemble the night sky.36 The ceiling of the antechamber and corridor were similarly painted. Whereas the stars in the antechamber and the burial chamber pointed northward the stars in the corridor pointed towards the zenith.27 The remaining walls of the burial chamber antechamber and parts of the corridor were inscribed with a series of vertically written texts chiselled in basrelief and painted blue.2736 Pyramid Texts of Unasedit Main article Pyramid Texts The burial chamber with protective spells filling the west gable protecting the sarcophagus and its contents below. The inscriptions known as the Pyramid Texts were the central innovation of Unass pyramid126 on whose subterranean walls they were first etched.1264 The Pyramid Texts are the oldest large corpus of religious writing known from ancient Egypt.12 A total of 283 such spells36 out of at least 1000 known and an indeterminate number of unknown ones65 appear in Unass pyramid.64 The spells are the smallest and bestpreserved collection of Pyramid Texts known from the Old Kingdom.66 Though they first appeared in Unass pyramid many of the texts are significantly older.
67 c The texts subsequently appeared in the pyramids of the kings and queens of the Sixth to Eighth Dynasties6570 until the end of the Old Kingdom.12 With the exception of a single spell copies of Unass texts appeared throughout the Middle Kingdom and later including a near complete replica of the texts in the tomb of Senwosretankh at ElLisht.6671 Ancient Egyptian belief held that the individual consisted of three basic parts the body the ka and the ba.72 When the person died the ka would separate from the body and return to the gods from where it had come while the ba remained with the body.72 The body of the individual interred in the burial chamber never physically left54 but the ba awakened released itself from the body and began its journey toward new life.7354 Significant to this journey was the Akhet the horizon a junction between the earth the sky and the Duat.74 To ancient Egyptians the Akhet was the place from where the sun rose and so symbolised a place of birth or resurrection.7475 In the texts the king is called upon to transform into an akh in the Akhet.7677 The akh literally effective being was the resurrected form of the deceased7278 attained through individual action and ritual performance.79 If the deceased failed to complete the transformation they became mutu that is the dead.7274 The function of the texts in congruence with all funerary literature was to enable the reunion of the rulers ba and ka leading to the transformation into an akh8078 and to secure eternal life among the gods in the sky.648182 The writings on the west gable in Unass burial chamber consist of spells that protect the sarcophagus and mummy within.8384 The north and south walls of the chamber are dedicated to the offering and resurrection rituals respectively5473 and the east wall contains texts asserting the kings control over his sustenance in the form of a response to the offering ritual.8586 The offering ritual texts continue onto the north and south walls of the passageway87 splitting the resurrection ritual which concludes on the south wall.8588 In the rituals of the burial chamber66 the king is identified both as himself and as the god Osiris89 being addressed as Osiris Unas.12 The king is also identified with other deities occasionally several alongside Osiris in other texts.90 The Egyptologist James Allen identifies the last piece of ritual text on the west gable of the antechamber85 Your son Horus has acted for you. The great ones will shake having seen the knife in your arm as you emerge from the Duat. Greetings experienced one Geb has created you the Ennead has given you birth. Horus has become content about his father Atum has become content about his years the eastern and western gods have become content about the great thing that has happened in his embrace  the gods birth. It is Unis Unis see It is Unis Unis look It is Unis hear It is Unis Unis exist It is Unis Unis raise yourself from your side Do my command you who hate sleep but were made slack. Stand up you in Nedit. Your good bread has been made in Pe receive your control of Heliopolis. It is Horus who speaks having been commanded to act for his father. The stormlord the one with spittle in his vicinity Seth  he will bear you he is the one who will bear Atum.91 The antechamber and corridor were inscribed primarily with personal texts.66 The west north and south walls of the antechamber contain texts whose primary concern is the transition from the human realm to the next and with the kings ascent to the sky.92 The east wall held a second set of protective spells starting with the Cannibal Hymn.93 In the hymn Unas consumes the gods to absorb their power for his resurrection.9495 The Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson identifies the hymn as a mythologizing of the butchery ritual in which a bull is sacrificed.95 The serdab remained uninscribed.96 The southern section of the walls of the corridor contain texts
97 d that focus primarily on the resurrection and ascension of the deceased.99 The mere presence of the spellse within the tomb were believed to have efficacy101 thus protecting the king even if the funerary cult ceased to function.1021
03 f Parts of the corpus of Pyramid Texts were passed down into the Coffin Texts81 an expanded set of new texts written on nonroyal tombs of the Middle Kingdom some retaining Old Kingdom grammatical conventions and with many formulations of the Pyramid Texts recurring.65105106 The transition to the Coffin Texts was begun in the reign of Pepi I and completed by the Middle Kingdom. The Coffin Texts formed the basis for the Book of the Dead in the New Kingdom and Late Period.81 The texts would resurface in tombs and on papyri for two millennia finally disappearing around the time that Christianity was adopted.107 Valley templeedit Valley temple belonging to Unass pyramid complex Layout of Unass valley temple. In order 1 Colonnaded entrance court 2 Entrance hall 3 South hall 
4 a and b Secondary entrances 5 Main cult hall 6 Storerooms 7 Passage leading to 8 the Causeway. Unass valley temple is situated in a harbour that naturally forms at the point where the mouth of a wadi meets the lake. The same wadi was used as a path for the causeway.56 The temple sits between those of Nyuserre Ini and Pepi II. Despite a complex plan the temple did not contain any significant innovations. It was richly decorated  in a fashion similar to the causeway and mortuary temple  and the surviving palm granite columns that stood at the entrance into the temple evidence their high quality craftsmanship.108 The main entrance into the temple was on the east side consisting of a portico with eight granite palm columns arranged into two rows. A narrow westward corridor led from the entry into a rectangular northsouth oriented hall. A second hall was to the south. Two secondary entrances into the halls were built on the north and south sides. Each had a portico with two columns. These were approached by narrow ramps. West of the two halls was the main cult hall. It had a second chamber with three storerooms to the south and a passageway leading to the causeway to the northwest.23 Causewayedit The causeway connecting the valley temple to the mortuary temple of Unass pyramid complex was constructed along the path provided by a natural wadi.5 The Egyptologist Iorwerth Edwards estimates the walls to be 4 m 13 ft high and 
2.0 4 m 6 ft 8 in thick. The passageway was about 
2.6 5 m 8 ft 8 in wide. It had a roof constructed from slabs 
0.4 5 m 1 ft 6 in thick projecting from each wall toward the centre.109 The causeway at between 720 m 2360 ft29 and 750 m 2460 ft5 long was among the longest constructed for any pyramid comparable to the causeway of Khufus pyramid.5 The causeway is also the best preserved of any from the Old Kingdom.110 Construction of the causeway was complicated and required negotiating uneven terrain and older buildings which were torn down and their stones appropriated as underlay. The causeway was built with two turns rather than in a straight line.29 Around 250 m 820 ft worth of Djosers causeway was used to provide embankments for Unass causeway and to plug gaps between it and the wadi.529 South of the uppermost bend of the causeway were two 45 m 148 ft long boat pits of white limestone which might originally have housed wooden boats with curved keels representing the day and night vessels of Ra the sun god.20111112 The boats lay side by side in an eastwest orientation.113 Causeway leading to the pyramid of Unas Tombs in the path of the causeway were built over preserving their decorations but not their contents indicating that the tombs had been robbed either before or during the causeways construction.20 Two large royal tombs dating to the Second Dynasty are among those that lie beneath the causeway.114115 The western gallery tomb contains seals bearing the names of Hotepsekhemwy and Nebra and the eastern gallery tomb contains numerous seals inscribed with the name of Ninetjer indicating probable ownership.114 The superstructures of the tombs were demolished allowing the mortuary temple and upper end of the causeway to be built over the top of them.31 The interior walls of the causeway were highly decorated with painted basreliefs but records of these are fragmentary.5 The remnants depict a variety of scenes including the hunting of wild animals the conducting of harvests scenes from the markets craftsmen working copper and gold a fleet returning from Byblos boats transporting columns from Aswan to the construction site battles with enemies and nomadic tribes the transport of prisoners lines of people bearing offerings and a procession of representatives from the nomes of Egypt.529116 A slit was left in a section of the causeway roofing allowing light to enter illuminating the brightly painted decorations on the walls.5 The archaeologist Peter Clayton notes that these depictions were more akin to those found in the mastabas of nobles.20 The Egyptologist Miroslav Verner highlights one particular scene from the causeway depicting famished desert nomads. The scene had been used as unique proof that the living standards of desert dwellers had declined during Unass reign as a result of climatic changes in the middle of the third millennium B.C. The discovery of a similar relief painting on the blocks of Sahures causeway casts doubt on this hypothesis. Verner contends that the nomads may have been brought in to demonstrate the hardships faced by pyramid builders bringing in higher quality stone from remote mountain areas.29 Grimal suggested that this scene foreshadowed the nationwide famine that seems to have struck Egyptg at the onset of the First Intermediate Period.118 According to Allen et al. the most widely accepted explanation for the scene is that it was meant to illustrate the generosity of the sovereign in aiding famished populations.119 End of Unass causeway facing the mortuary temple A collection of tombs were found north of the causeway.120 The tomb of Akhethetep a vizier was discovered by a team led by Christiane Ziegler.121 The other mastabas belong to the viziers Ihy Iynofert Nyankhba and Mehu.122123 The tombs are conjectured to belong to Unass viziers with the exception of Mehus tomb which is associated with Pepi I.122 Another tomb belonging to Unasankh son of Unas separates the tombs of Ihy and Iynofert.124125 It may be dated late into Unass reign.124 Ahmed Moussa discovered the rockcut tombs of Nefer and Kahay  court singers during Menkauhors reign126  south of Unass causeway containing nine burials along with an extremely well preserved mummy found in a coffin in a shaft under the east wall of the chapel.127 The Chief Inspector at Saqqara Mounir Basta discovered another rockcut tomb just south of the causeway in 1964 later excavated by Ahmed Moussa. The tombs belonged to two palace officials  manicurists128  living during the reigns of Nyuserre Ini and Menkauhor in the Fifth Dynasty named Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep. A highly decorated chapel for the tomb was discovered the following year. The chapel was located inside a unique stone mastaba that was connected to the tombs through an undecorated open court.127 Mortuary templeedit Layout of Unass mortuary temple. In order 1 Granite doorway built by Teti 2 Entrance hall with 
5 a and b storerooms to the north and south 3 Courtyard with 4 eighteen granite columns 6 Transverse corridor 7 Chapel with five statue niches 
8 a b and c Storerooms of the inner temple 9 Antichambre carre with central column 10 Offering hall with 11 false door bearing a protective inscription 12 Cult pyramid and 13 Courtyard surrounding the pyramid complex. The mortuary temple in Unass pyramid complex has a layout comparable to his predecessor Djedkare Isesis with one notable exception. A pink granite doorway separates the end of the causeway from the entrance hall. It bears the names and titles of Teti Unass successor indicating that he must have had the doorway constructed following Unass death.1295 The entrance hall had a vaulted ceiling and a floor paved with alabaster. The walls in the room were decorated with relief paintings that depicted the making of offerings.130 The entrance hall terminates in an open columned courtyard with eighteen  two more columns than in Djedkare Isesis complex  pink granite palm columns supporting the roof of an ambulatory.1305 Some of the columns were reused centuries later in buildings in Tanis the capital of Egypt during the Twenty First and Twenty Second Dynasties. Other columns have been displayed in the British Museum and in the Louvre. Relief decorations that were formerly in the courtyard have also been reused in later projects as shown by the presence of reliefs of Unas in Amenemhat Is pyramid complex in ElLisht.130 Papyriform column from Unass mortuary temple on display in the Louvre North and south of the entrance hall and columned courtyard were storerooms.130 These were stocked regularly with offering items for the royal funerary cult which had expanded influenceh in the Fifth Dynasty.136 Their irregular placement resulted in the northern storerooms being twice as numerous as the southern. The rooms were used for burials in the Late Period as noted by the presence of large shaft tombs.130 At the far end of the courtyard was a transverse corridor creating an intersection between the columned courtyard at its east and inner temple to its west with a cult pyramid to the south and a larger courtyard surrounding the pyramid to the north.28 The inner temple is accessed by a small staircase leading into a ruined chapel with five statue niches.1305 The chapel and offering hall were surrounded by storerooms as elsewhere in the temple there were more storerooms to the north than south.137 The antichambre carre  a square antechamber5  separated the chapel from the offering hall.130 The room measures 
4.2  m 14 ft 
8.0  cu on each side making it the smallest such chamber from the Old Kingdom138 but has been largely destroyed.130 It was originally entered through a door on its eastern side and contained two additional doors leading to the offering hall and storeroom.138 The room contained a single column made of quartzite  fragments of which have been found in the southwest part of the temple130  quarried from the Gabel Ahmar stone quarry near Heliopolis.5 Quartzite being a particularly hard stone  a 7 on the Mohs hardness scale  was not typically used in architectural projects139 but was used sparingly as a building material at some Old Kingdom sites in Saqqara.140141 The hard stone is associated with the sun cult a natural development caused by the coloration of the material being sunlike.1425 Remnants of a granite false door bearing an inscription concerning the souls of the residents of Nekhen and Buto marks what little of the offering hall has been preserved. A block from the door has been displayed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.130143 Cult pyramidedit The purpose of the cult pyramid remains unclear. It had a burial chamber but was not used for burials and instead appears to have been a purely symbolic structure.144 It may have hosted the pharaohs ka145 or a miniature statue of the king.48 It may have been used for ritual performances centring around the burial and resurrection of the ka spirit during the Sed festival.48 The cult pyramid in Unass complex has identifiable remains but has otherwise been destroyed.146 The preserved elements suggest that it had a base length of 
11.5  m 38 ft 22 cu a fifth of that of the main pyramid. The pyramids covering slabs were inclined at 69. This was typical for cult pyramids which had a 21 ratioed slope and thus a height equal to the length of the base i.e. 
11.5  m 38 ft 22 cu. A small channel was dug in front of the pyramid entrance perhaps to prevent runoff from entering the pyramid.147 The first slabs of the descending corridor are declined at 
30.5 . The pit measures 
5.1 5 m 17 ft 10 cu northsouth and 
8.1 5 m 27 ft 16 cu eastwest. The burial chamber was cut 
2.0 3 m 7 ft 4 cu deep into the rock sits 
2.1 2 m 7 ft 4 cu beneath the pavement and measures 5 m 16 ft 10 cu by 
2.5  m 8 ft 5 cu.148 The great enclosurei of the main pyramid and inner temple has an identifiable anomaly. Four m 13 ft 8 cu from the cult pyramids west face the wall abruptly turns to the north before receding for 12 m 39 ft 23 cu toward the main pyramid. It stops 
2.6  m 
8.5  ft 
5.0  cu from the main pyramid and turns once more back onto its original alignment.149 The only explanation for this is the presence of the Second Dynasty Hotepsekhemwys large tomb which spans the width of the whole temple and crosses directly under the recess. The architects of the pyramid appear to have preferred for the enclosure wall to run over the tombs passageway rather than over the top of the subterranean gallery. The cult pyramid has its own secondary enclosure that runs along the north face of the pyramid and half of its west face. This secondary wall was about 
1.0 4 m 3 ft 2 cu thick and had a doubledoor 
0.8  m 
2.6  ft thick built close to its start.150 Later historyedit Evidence suggests that Unass funerary cult survived through the First Intermediate Period and into the Middle Kingdom151 an indication that Unas retained prestige long after his death.152 Two independent pieces of evidence corroborate the existence of the cult in the Middle Kingdom 1 A stela dated to the Twelfth Dynasty bearing the name Unasemsafj and 2 A statue of a Memphite official Sermaatk from the Twelfth or Thirteenth Dynasty with an inscription invoking Unass name.154 The Egyptologist Jaromr Mlek contends that the evidence only suggests a theoretical revival of the cult a result of the valley temple serving as a useful entry path into the Saqqara necropolis but not its persistence from the Old Kingdom.155 Despite renewed interest in the Old Kingdom rulers at the time their funerary complexes including Unass were partially reused in the construction of Amenemhat Is and Senusret Is pyramid complexes at ElLisht.156 One block used in Amenemhats complex has been positively identified as originating from Unass complex likely taken from the causeway on the basis of inscriptions containing his name appearing upon it.157 Several other blocks have their origins speculatively assigned to Unass complex as well.158 The Saqqara plateau witnessed a new era of tomb building in the New Kingdom. Starting with the reign of Thutmose III in the Eighteenth Dynasty and up until possibly the Twentieth Dynasty Saqqara was used as a site for the tombs of private individuals.159 The largest concentrations of tombs from the period are found in a large area south of Unass causeway.160 This area came to prominent use around the time of Tutankhamun.161 Unass pyramid underwent restorative work in the New Kingdom. In the Nineteenth Dynasty20 Khaemweset High Priest of Memphis and son of Ramesses II had an inscription carved onto a block on the pyramids south side commemorating his restoration work.527 Late Period monuments colloquially called the Persian tombs thought to date to the reign of Amasis II were discovered near the causeway. These include tombs built for Tjannehebu Overseer of the Royal Navy Psamtik the Chief Physician and Peteniese Overseer of Confidential Documents. The Egyptologist John D. Ray explains that the site was chosen because it was readily accessible from both Memphis and the Nile Valley.162 Traces of Phoenician and Aramaic burials have been reported in the area directly south of Unass causeway.163 See alsoedit List of Egyptian pyramids List of megalithic sites Notesedit  Proposed dates for Unass reign c. 24042374 BC1011 c. 23752345 BC1213 c. 23562323 BC14 c. 23532323 BC15 c. 23122282 BC16 c. 237848234818  13 years BC.17  The function of the serdab is unclear.51 Joachim Spiegel de considered the room to represent the day sky.52 Nicolas Grimal postulates that these held statues of the deceased.53 Mark Lehner adds that the niches could have been used for storing provisions of the cult a symbolic transfer of offerings presented at the offering halls false door into the subterranean chambers.54 Leclant disputes the royal statue hypothesis proffering instead their use as storage compartments for funerary materials.55 Bernard Mathieu posits that the serdab represents the Demeure dOsiris residence of Osiris where the ruler has to descend below the horizon before resuming their ascent to the northern sky.56 James Allen notes that it may relate to the tripartite Tomb of Horus featured in the Amduat containing Horuss dismembered body after he is slain by Seth. The three recesses thus contained the human head falcon wings and feline rear of Horus.5257  Many of the texts of the offering ritual share commonalities with an offering list that has been discovered in other Fifth Dynasty tombs. The earliest intact example has been sourced from the nonroyal tomb of Debeheni apparently endowed to him by Menkaure of the Fourth Dynasty. Precursor lists have been dated to nonroyal tombs built during Khufus reign two centuries before Unass reign.68 Fragments of the list have been discovered in the mortuary temples of the Fifth Dynasty rulers Sahure Neferirkare Kakai and Nyuserre.69  In Unass pyramid only the south sections of the horizontal passage was inscribed.9836 Tetis pyramid received the same treatment though the pyramids of Merenre and Pepi II had writings throughout the entire horizontal passage and the vestibule with the three granite portcullises and Pepi Is pyramid also had writings on a section of the ascending corridor as well.98  The symbols were strongly believed to have powerful magic imbued within so much so that hieroglyphic symbols representing dangerous animals such as a snake or lion were intentionally damaged after being inscribed in order to prevent them from corporealising and threatening the well being of the king in his chambers.100  A motivator for the regular performance of the cult was the temporary nature of oration. By inscribing the texts the rites gained permanence.104 Even as an akh the deceased required the attention of the living who sustained them through rituals and offerings.74  The issue of famines and economic crises is a hallmark of the First Intermediate Period of Egypt. A series of failures of the Nile flood in various years a result of climate change is often blamed for the collapse of the Old Kingdom. Evidence in the form of biographical testimonies such as the inscriptions of Ankhtifi in his tomb at ElMoalla attesting to the famines are numerous but somewhat questionable. Climatic change bringing drier seasons appears to have started during the Old Kingdom and archaeological observations at Elephantine suggests that flooding seasons were better not worse during the First Intermediate Period. Crises were socially significant during the period and gave a basis for the legitimacy of rulers power. Rulers positioned themselves as caring for the whole of their society including the weak and unfortunate ensuring their right to authority and respect.117  By the Fifth Dynasty the religious institution had established itself as the dominant force in society131132 a trend of growth in the bureaucracy and the priesthood and a decline in the pharaohs power had been established during Neferirkare Kakais reign and only intensified during Unass.133 The prioritization of cult activities received its expression in the expansive storeroom complexes134 that became a feature of pyramid temples beginning with Sahures reign116 and the space they occupied increased in a linear fashion from Neferirkare Kakais reign onwards.135  translated from the French la grande enceinte147  transl.
