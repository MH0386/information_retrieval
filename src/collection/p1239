He is director of the research center Canon and Identity Formation in the Earliest Literate Societies under the University of Copenhagen Programme of Excellence since 2008 and director of The Papyrus Carlsberg Collection  Project since 19
99.1 2 Researchedit One of his most significant publications is a 1997 book titled The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c. 18001550 B.C.3 Aidan Dodson a prominent English Egyptologist calls Ryholts book fundamental for an understanding of the Second Intermediate Period4 because it reviews the political history of this period and contains an updatedand more accuratereconstruction of the Turin Canon since the 1959 publication of Alan Gardiners Royal Canon of Egypt. It also contains an extensive catalogue of all the known monuments inscriptions and seals for the kings of this period. Ryholt is also a specialist on Demotic papyri and literature and has authored numerous books and articles about this subject. In 2011 he discovered the identity of the famous sage king Nechepsos.5 Since 2013 he has directed a project on ancient ink as technology.6 He has also written a book on antiquities trade with Fredrik Norland Hagen. Second Intermediate Periodedit Ryholts study makes note of numerous recent archaeological finds including the discovery of a new Hyksos king named SakirHar the find of a doorjamb at Gebel Antef in the mid19
90 s which establishes that Sekhemre Shedtawy Sobekemsaf Sobekemsaf II here was the father of the 
17 th Dynasty Theban kings Antef VI and Antef VII. He also discusses Ahmoses Unwetterstele document. The book also argues strongly that the Sixteenth dynasty of Egypt was made up of poorly attested Theban kings such as Nebiriau I Nebiriau II Seuserenre Bebiankh and Sekhemre Shedwast who are documented in the last surviving page of the Turin Canon rather than minor Hyksos vassal kings in Lower Egypt as was generally believed. Among the most significant discussions is Ryholts evidence that Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep rather than Ugaf was the first king of Egypts 
13 th Dynasty7 and a discussion of the foreign origins of the Semitic 
13 th Dynasty king named Khendjerwhose reign lasted a minimum of 4 years and 3 months based on dated workmens control notes found on stone blocks from his pyramid complex.8 The most controversial conclusion concerns the identity and dating of 
14 th Dynasty. Ryholt  like Manfred Bietak  argues that it was a forerunner of the 
15 th Dynasty but differs in regarding it as contemporary with the 
13 th Dynasty from the latters founding around 1800 BC until its collapse in c. 16501648 BC. This view is questioned in a review of the book by Daphna Ben Tor and JamesSusan Allen.9 Ryholt has also suggested that Maaibre Sheshi one of the best attested kings of the 
14 th Dynasty was contemporary with the early 
13 th Dynasty on the basis of an archaeological deposit at Uronarti where a sealimpression of this king was found together with impressions of two early 
13 th dynasty Egyptian kings.10 Ben Tor has posited that the context of Maaibre Sheshi seal is not secure and that it was most likely a New Kingdom seal impression.11 The likelihood of New Kingdom intrusions into the Uronarti context was confirmed by Yvonne Markowitz and acknowledged by Reisner.12 Ryholts proposal that king Sheshi Ammu Ahotepre and Yakbim Sekhaenre were rulers of the 
14 th Dynasty is contested by Ben Tors study of the strata levels of their seals which in her view indicate dating to the second half of the Hyksos 
15 th Dynasty and are not contemporary with the 
13 th dynasty. Turin King Listedit Ryholt is regardedby whom as a major scholar in the study of the Turin King List having examined the document in person twice he has published new and better interpretations of this damaged papyrus document in his aforementioned 1997 book and in a ZAS paper titled The Late Old Kingdom in the Turin Kinglist and the Identity of Nitocris13 and has published a detailed discussion of the nature of the document.14 Ryholt reportedly intends to publish his study of the Turin Kinglist in the near future.citation needed Selected publicationsedit Ryholt Kim and Gojko Barjamovic eds. 2020.
