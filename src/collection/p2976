The familys most celebrated members were Philip II of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great under whose leadership the kingdom of Macedonia gradually gained predominance throughout Greece defeated the Achaemenid Empire and expanded as far as Egypt and India. The mythical founder of the Argead dynasty is King Caranus.89 The Argeads claimed descent from Heracles through his greatgreatgrandson Temenus also king of Argos. Originedit Triobol of Argos top and a bronze coin of King Amyntas II of Macedon bottom. The early Argead kings often copied the wolf of Argos coins on their own coinage to highlight their supposed ancestry from this city.10 The words Argead and Argive derive via Latin Argvus11 from the Greek  Argeios meaning of or from Argos12 which is first attested in Homer where it was also used as a collective designation for the Greeks   Argive Danaans.1314 The Argead dynasty claimed descent from the Temenids of Argos in the Peloponnese whose legendary ancestor was Temenus the greatgreatgrandson of Heracles.1 In the excavations of the royal palace at Aegae Manolis Andronikos discovered in the tholos room according to some scholars tholos was the throne room a Greek inscription relating to that belief.15 This is testified by Herodotus in The Histories where he mentions that three brothers of the lineage of Temenus Gauanes Aeropus and Perdiccas fled from Argos to the Illyrians and then to Upper Macedonia to a town called Lebaea where they served the king. The latter asked them to leave his territory believing in an omen that something great would happen to Perdiccas. The boys went to another part of Macedonia near the garden of Midas above which mount Bermio stands. There they made their abode and slowly formed their own kingdom.16 Herodotus also relates the incident of the participation of Alexander I of Macedon in the Olympic Games in 504 or 500 BC where the participation of the Macedonian king was contested by participants on the grounds that he was not Greek. The Hellanodikai however after examining his Argead claim confirmed that the Macedonian kings were Greeks and allowed him to participate.17 The route of the Argeads from Argos Peloponnese to Macedonia according to Herodotus. Another theory supported by the Greek historian Miltiades Hatzopoulos following the opinion of the ancient author Appian is that the Argead dynasty actually came from Argos Orestikon.1819 Periods and dynasties of ancient Egypt All years are BC Early Predynastic period First Dynasty I c. 31502890 Second Dynasty II 28902686 Old Kingdom Third Dynasty III 26862613 Fourth Dynasty IV 26132498 Fifth Dynasty V 24982345 Sixth Dynasty VI 23452181 First Intermediate Seventh Dynasty VII spurious Eighth Dynasty VIII 21812160 Ninth Dynasty IX 21602130 Tenth Dynasty X 21302040 Early Eleventh Dynasty XI 21342061 Middle Kingdom Late Eleventh Dynasty XI 20611991 Twelfth Dynasty XII 19911803 Thirteenth Dynasty XIII 18031649 Second Intermediate Fourteenth Dynasty XIV 17051690 Fifteenth Dynasty Hyksos XV 16741535 Sixteenth Dynasty XVI 16601600 Abydos Dynasty 16501600 Seventeenth Dynasty XVII 15801549 New Kingdom Eighteenth Dynasty XVIII 15491292 Nineteenth Dynasty XIX 12921189 Twentieth Dynasty XX 11891077 Third Intermediate Twentyfirst Dynasty XXI 1069945 Twentysecond Dynasty XXII 945720 Twentythird Dynasty XXIII 837728 Twentyfourth Dynasty XXIV 732720 Twentyfifth Dynasty Nubian XXV 732653 Late Period Twentysixth Dynasty XXVI 672525 Twentyseventh Dynasty

They also added Mygdonia in their territory through the expulsion of the Edoni Eordians and Almopians.20 Historyedit Succession disputesedit The death of the king almost invariably triggered dynastic disputes and often a war of succession between members of the Argead family leading to political and economic instability.21 These included Sixyear Macedonian interregnum 399393 BCE after the death of king Archelaus between Orestes Aeropus II Amyntas II and Pausanias22 Macedonian war of succession 393392 BCE after the death of king Pausanias between Amyntas III and Argaeus II23 Macedonian war of succession 369368 BCE after the death of king Amyntas III between Ptolemy of Aloros and Alexander II of Macedoncitation needed Macedonian war of succession 360359 BCE after the death of king Perdiccas III between Philip II who deposed Amyntas IV Argeus supported by Athens Pausanias supported by Thrace and Archelaus supported by the Chalcidian League21 Wars of the Diadochi 323277 BCE after the death of king Alexander the Great between his Diadochi Successors Additionally longestablished monarchs could still face a rebellion by a relative when the formers kingship was perceived to be weak. An example was Philips rebellion against his older brother king Perdiccas II in the prelude to the Peloponnesian War 433431 BCE.

Family treeedit Modern historians disagree on a number of details concerning the genealogy of the Argead dynasty. Robin Lane Fox for example refutes Nicholas Hammonds claim that Ptolemy of Aloros was Amyntas IIs son arguing that Ptolemy was neither his son nor an Argead.24 Consequently the charts below do not account for every chronological genealogical and dynastic complexity. Instead they represent one common reconstruction of the Argeads advanced by historians such as Hammond Elizabeth Carney and Joseph Roisman.25262728 Simplified Family Tree Perdiccas I r.c. 650 BC Argaeus I r.c. 623 BC Philip I r.c. 593 BC Aeropus I r.c. 563 BC Alcetas r.c. 533 BC Amyntas I r.  497 BC Alexander I r.497  454 BC Perdiccas II r.454  413 BC Menelaus Amyntas Archelaus r.413  399 BC Aeropus II r.397  394 BC Argaeus II r.388  387 BC Amyntas II r.394 Arrhidaeus Orestes r.399  397 BC Pausanias r.394 Ptolemy of Aloros r.368  365 BC Amyntas III r.393  370 BC Alexander II r.370  368 BC Perdiccas III r.365  359 BC Philip II r.359  336 BC Amyntas IV r.359 Philip III Arrhidaeus r.323  317 BC Alexander the Great r.336  323 BC Alexander IV r.323  310 BC Detailed Family Tree Individuals with disputed heritage or rule are italicized.

Thus the kings were of largely Dorian Greek stock see PHILIP 1 they presumably spoke a form of Dorian Greek and their cultural tradition had Greek features.  Cosmopoulos 1992 p. 30.  Grant 1988 p. 259 It was the descendants of these Dorians ... who formed the upper class among the Macedonians of subsequent epochs.  Cosmopoulos 1992 TABLE 2 The Argeiad Kings p. 30.

0.8 9 Caranus set up a trophy after the Argive fashion for a victory against Cisseus The Macedonians say that Caranus king of Macedonia overcame in battle Cisseus a chieftain in a bordering country. For his victory Caranus set up a trophy after the Argive fashion but it is said to have been upset by a lion from Olympus which then vanished. Caranus they assert realized that it was a mistaken policy to incur the undying hatred of the nonGreeks dwelling around and so they say the rule was adopted that no king of Macedonia neither Caranus himself nor any of his successors should set up trophies if they were ever to gain the goodwill of their neighbors. This story is confirmed by the fact that Alexander set up no trophies neither for his victory over Dareius nor for those he won in India.  Hoover 2011 p. 161 Hoover 2016 p. 295.  Lewis  Short 1879 Argvus.  Liddell  Scott 1940 .  Cartledge 2011 Chapter 4 Argos p. 23 The Late Bronze Age in Greece is also called conventionally Mycenaean as we saw in the last chapter. But it might in principle have been called Argive Achaean or Danaan since the three names that Homer does in fact apply to Greeks collectively were Argives Achaeans and Danaans.  Homer. Iliad
