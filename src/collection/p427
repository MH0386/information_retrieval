Alabaster sculpture of an Old Kingdom pharaoh Pepi I Meryre dressed to celebrate his Heb Sed c. 2362 BCE Brooklyn Museum The Sed festival bsd conventional pronunciation sd also known as Heb Sed or Feast of the Tail was an ancient Egyptian ceremony that celebrated the continued rule of a pharaoh. The name is taken from the name of an Egyptian wolf god one of whose names was Wepwawet or Sed.1 The lessformal feast name the Feast of the Tail is derived from the name of the animals tail that typically was attached to the back of the pharaohs garment in the early periods of Egyptian history. This tail might have been the vestige of a previous ceremonial robe made out of a complete animal skin.2 The ancient festival might perhaps have been instituted to replace a ritual of murdering a pharaoh who was unable to continue to rule effectively because of age or condition.34 Eventually Sed festivals were jubilees celebrated after a ruler had held the throne for thirty years and then every three to four years after that. The festival primarily served to reassert pharaonic authority and state ideology. Sed festivals implied elaborate temple rituals and included processions offerings and such acts of religious devotion as the ceremonial raising of a djed the base or sacrum of a bovine spine a phallic symbol representing the strength potency and duration of the pharaohs rule.5 The festival also involved symbolic reaffirmation of the pharaohs rulership over Upper and Lower Egypt.6 Pharaohs who followed the typical tradition but did not reign so long as 30 years had to be content with promises of millions of jubilees in the afterlife.7 Despite the antiquity of the Sed festival and the hundreds of references to it throughout the history of ancient Egypt the most detailed records of the ceremoniesapart from the reign of Amenhotep IIIcome mostly from relief cycles of the Fifth Dynasty king Neuserra... in his sun temple at Abu Ghurab of Akhenaten at East Karnak and the relief cycles of the Twentysecond Dynasty king Osorkon II... at Bubastis.8 Festivals throughout historyedit Detail from an ebony label of the First Dynasty pharaoh Den depicting him running around the ritual boundary markers as part of the Sed festival. HebSed court south of Pyramid of Djoser in Saqqara Egypt Old Kingdomedit Detail from an ebony label of the First Dynasty pharaoh Den depicting him running around the ritual boundary markers as part of the Sed festival. There is clear evidence for early pharaohs celebrating the Heb Sed such as the First Dynasty pharaoh Den and the Third Dynasty pharaoh Djoser.9 In the Pyramid of Djoser there are two boundary stones in his Heb Sed court which is within his pyramid complex. He also is shown performing the Heb Sed in a false doorway inside his pyramid. The two boundary stones would have functioned as symbolic reminders of Djosers dominion over Upper and Lower Egypt and their placement within his mortuary complex would allow the king to continue carrying out the HebSed in perpetuity after his death.1011 One of the earlier Sed festivals for which there is substantial evidence is that of the Sixth Dynasty pharaoh Pepi I Meryre in the South Saqqara Stone Annal document as the document corroborates a reign of at least 40 years despite its damage.12 In addition there are alabaster containers commemorating Pepi Is first Sed festival.1314 Given the subsequent First Intermediate Period there is a lack of extant monuments and other manifestations of centralized state activity creating a void of any evidence of a Sed festival after the Sixth Dynasty. Middle Kingdomedit During the Middle Kingdom the power of the pharaoh became consolidated once again and monuments began to be built as they had previously in the Old Kingdom.

12 th Dynasty. Petrie Museum Amenemhat I based on evidence provided by foundation blocks in his pyramid appears to have ruled coregent with his son Senusret I.15 Based upon the chronology presented by the monument the 
29 th regnal year of Amenemhat I would have been the 
10 th regnal year of his son.15 Therefore Amenemhat I would have been ineligible for a sed festival at least per tradition. During his independent reign Senusret I is notable both for his erection of the White Chapel a pavilion meant to commemorate his Heb Sed and for his Sed festival celebration taking place in his 
31 st year as opposed to his 
30 th.16 The chapel would subsequently be incorporated into the Festival Hall of Thutmose II and Amenhotep IIIs Third Pylon at Karnak.16 Notably Amenemhat II despite appearing to have ruled for approximately 35 years did not appear to have any kind of HebSed.17 New Kingdomedit The most lavish of the Sed Festivals judging by surviving inscriptions were those of Amenhotep III c. 1360 BCE and Ramesses II who had his first of over a dozen in approximately 1249 BCE. Several pharaohs seem to have deviated from the traditional 
30 year tradition notably two pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty Hatshepsut and Akhenaten rulers in a dynasty that was recovering from occupation by foreigners reestablishing itself and redefining many traditions. Hatshepsut celebrated her Sed jubilee at Thebes but she did this by counting the time she was the consort to her husband and some recent research indicates that she did exercise authority usually reserved for pharaohs during his reign thereby acting as a coruler rather than as his Great Royal Wife the duties of which were assigned to their royal daughter. Upon her husbands death the only eligible male in the royal family was a stepson and nephew of hers who was a child. He was made a consort and shortly thereafter she was crowned pharaoh. Some Egyptologists such as Jrgen von Beckerath in his book Chronology of the Egyptian Pharaohs speculate that Hatshepsut may have celebrated her first Sed jubilee to mark the passing of 30 years from the death of her father Thutmose I from whom she derived all of her legitimacy to rule Egypt. He had appointed his daughter to the highest administrative office in his government giving her a coregents experience at ruling many aspects of his bureaucracy. This reflects an oracular assertion supported by the priests of AmunRe that her father named her as heir to the throne.18 Bas relief depiction of Osorkon IIs Sed festival from Bubastis. Louvre Museum Paris Akhenaten made many changes to religious practices in order to lessen the influence of the priests of AmunRe whom he saw as corrupt.19 His religious reformation may have begun with his decision to celebrate his first Sed festival in his third regnal year. His purpose may have been to gain an advantage against the powerful temple since a Sedfestival was a royal jubilee intended to reinforce the pharaohs divine powers and religious leadership. At the same time Akhenaten also moved the capital of Egypt to Tellel Amarna. Akhenaten established Tellel Amarna for the sole worship of Aten an unprecedented action by a pharaoh which could explain as to why he would want to consolidate religious and political power. This is in contrast to Akhenatens father Amenhotep III who emphasized the polytheistic status quo at his own Sed Festival.19 Sed festivals still were celebrated by the later Libyanera kings such as Shoshenq III Shoshenq V Osorkon I who had his second Heb Sed in his 
33 rd year and Osorkon II who constructed a massive temple at Bubastis complete with a red granite gateway decorated with scenes of this jubilee to commemorate his own HebSed Referencesedit  Shaw Ian. Exploring Ancient Egypt. Oxford University Press. 2003. ISBN 0195116
