26 th Dynasty Menkheperre Necho I Egyptian Nekau1 Greek   or   Akkadian Nikuu6 or Nik7   664 BCE near Memphis was a ruler of the ancient Egyptian city of Sais. He was the first securely attested local Saite king of the 
26 th Dynasty of Egypt who reigned for 8 years 672664 BCE according to Manethos Aegyptiaca. Egypt was reunified by his son Psamtik I. Biographyedit In 672 BCE Necho became ruler of Sais assuming the pharaonic titulary and a year later the Assyrians led by Esarhaddon invaded Egypt. Necho became one of Esarhaddons vassals and the latter confirmed Nechos office and his possessions as well as giving him new territories possibly including the city of Memphis.8 In 669 BCE King Taharqa of the 
25 th Dynasty was advancing from the south toward the Nile Delta principalities which were formally under Assyrian control Esarhaddon prepared himself to return to Egypt to repel the invader but died suddenly. Esarhaddons death led to a political crisis in the NeoAssyrian Empire but at the end his son Ashurbanipal managed to become the new undisputed monarch. The counteroffensive planned by his father took place in 667666 BCE.910 Taharqa was defeated and driven back to Thebes but Ashurbanipal found that the fleeing king and some of the rulers of Lower Egypt  named Pekrur of Pishaptu PerSopdu Sharruludari of inu maybe Pelusium and Nikuu Necho I  were plotting against him. The Assyrian king captured the conspirators killed part of the population of the cities they governed and deported the prisoners to Nineveh.11 Unexpectedly Necho was pardoned by the Assyrian king and was reinstated at Sais with his previous possessions as well as many new territories as a gift while his son Psamtik called Nabusezibanni in Akkadian was made mayor of Athribis.126 It has been suggested that with his magnanimity Ashurbanipal hoped to rely on the loyalty of an Egyptian ally in the event of another offensive led by the 
25 th Dynasty pharaohs and perhaps to inspire and strengthen a rivalry between the two families i.e. Kushites and Saites because of shared interests.12 According to historical records Necho I was slain in 664 BCE near Memphis while defending his realms from a new Kushite offensive led by Taharqas successor Tantamani12613 while Psamtik fled to Nineveh under Ashurbanipals aegis. This Nubian invasion into the Egyptian Delta was subsequently 664663 BCE repelled by the Assyrians who proceeded to advance south into Upper Egypt and performed the infamous sack of Thebes.14 With the Nile Delta secured once again Psamtik I was appointed with his dead fathers offices and territories. Later he ultimately was successful in reuniting Egypt under his sole control.15 Familyedit See also Twentysixth Dynasty of Egypt family tree Danish Egyptologist Kim Ryholt made claims regarding Necho I studying a papyrus from Tebtunis he stated that Necho I was the son of a king named Tefnakht presumably Tefnakht II.5 Ryholt also put in discussion the existence of Nekauba who was the purported predecessor of Necho I and possibly his brother Ryholt suggested that the few dubious documents regarding Nekauba should be attributed to the later Necho II instead and that Necho I was the direct successor of Tefnakht II.2 French historian Christian Settipani believes that Necho married Istemabet and they were the parents of Psamtik I.4 According to British Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen it is possible that princess Takheredentaihetweret was Nechos daughter given in a politically arranged marriage to the local ruler of Herakleopolis Pediese.16 A nowlost limestone lintel from Luxor depicted a chantress of Amun named Meresamun along with a Saite form of Osiris and the Divine Adoratrice of Amun Shepenupet II Meresamun is called royal daughter of the lord of the Two lands Nec... the latter name written within a royal cartouche. It appears likely that Meresamuns royal father was no other than Necho I who sent his daughter to the Precinct of AmunRe in Karnak thus marking the beginning of the Saite influence in the city of Thebes.17 Attestationsedit Kneeling statuette of a king Necho.
