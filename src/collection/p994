13 th Dynasty Hor Awibre also known as Hor I was an Egyptian pharaoh of the early 
13 th Dynasty in the late Middle Kingdom. Attestationsedit Hor remained unattested until the discovery in 1894 of his nearly intact tomb in Dashur by Jacques de Morgan see below.1 Dahshur Tomb and Burial Goodsedit At Dahshur the Shafttomb of Hor is located inside the Pyramid Complex of Amenemhat III reusing and expanding a shafttomb originally made for a member of the royal court of Amenemhat III. Burial goods include a canopic chest3 canopic jars4 goldleaf5 and a kastatuette.67 TanisMemphis Architraveedit At Tanis Nile Delta region in a secondary context a granite architrave with the cartouches of Hor and Sekhemre Khutawy Khabaw was found. The architrave probably originated in Memphis and came to the Delta region during the Hyksos period.1 Based on this evidence the egyptologist Kim Ryholt proposed that Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw was a son and coregent of Hor Awibre.2 Present location of this architrave is unknown.

13 th Dynasty King Hor I.1011 NonContemporary Attestationedit The Turin King List entry 717 lists The Dual King Awtibra ... 7 days.1213 In this list Hor us preceded by Renseneb 716 and succeeded by Sedjefakare 718. Reignedit According to Ryholt and Darrell Baker Hor Awibre was the fifteenth ruler of the 
13 th Dynasty.12 Alternatively Detlef Franke and Jrgen von Beckerath see him as the fourteenth king of the dynasty.14151617 No evidence has been found that relate Hor to his predecessor on the throne Renseneb which led Ryholt and Baker to propose that he was an usurper. Hor Awibres reign length is partially lost to a lacuna of the Turin canon and is consequently unknown. According to the latest reading of the Turin canon by Ryholt the surviving traces indicate the number of days as ... and 7 days.2 In the previous authoritative reading of the canon by Alan Gardiner which dates to the 19
50 s this was read as ... 7 months.18 This led scholars such as Miroslav Verner and Darrell Baker to believe that Hors reign was ephemeral while Ryholts reading leaves a longer reign possible and indeed Ryholt credits Hor with 2 years of reign.12 In any case Hor most likely reigned only for a short time in particular not long enough to prepare a pyramid which was still the common burial place for kings of the early 
13 th dynasty. Regardless of the duration of his reign Hor was seemingly succeeded by his two sons Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw and Djedkheperew. Tombedit Drawing by Jacques de Morgan of the scepters and staves of Hor Awibre. Hor is mainly known from his nearly intact tomb discovered in 1894 by Jacques de Morgan working in collaboration with Georges Legrain and Gustave Jequier in Dahshur.19 The tomb was nothing more than a shaft built on the northeast corner of the pyramid of the 
12 th Dynasty pharaoh Amenemhat III.20 The tomb was originally made for a member of Amenemhats court and was later enlarged for Hor with the addition of a stone burial chamber and antechamber.1 Although the tomb had been pillaged in antiquity it still contained a naos with a rare lifesize wooden statue of the Ka of the king. This statue is one of the most frequently reproduced examples of Ancient Egyptian art and is now in the Egyptian Museum under the catalog number CG2
59.2 0 It is one of the bestpreserved and most accomplished wooden statues to survive from antiquity and illustrates an artistic genre that must once have been common in Egyptian art but has rarely survived in such good condition. Plan of the tomb of king Hor The tomb also contained the partly gilded rotten wooden coffin of the king. The kings wooden funerary mask its eyes of stones set in bronze19 had been stripped of its gold gilding but still held the kings skull. Hors canopic box was also found complete with its canopic vessels. The mummy of the king had been ransacked for his jewelry and only Hors skeleton was left in his coffin.19 The king was determined to have been in his forties at the time of his death. Other artifacts from the tomb include small statues alabaster and wooden vases some jewelry two alabaster stelae inscribed with blue painted hieroglyphs and a number of flails scepters and wooden staves which had all been disposed in a long wooden case. These had been intentionally broken in pieces.19 The tomb also housed weapons such as a granite macehead19 and a goldenleaf dagger and numerous pottery. Next to the burial of Hor was found the totally undisturbed tomb of the kings daughter Nubheteptikhered. She was likely a daughter of Hor21 or otherwise a daughter of Amenemhat III.20 Theoriesedit Some Egyptologists speculate his reign was from c. 1777 BC until 1775 BC2 or for a few months c. 1760 BC or c. 1732 BC22 Referencesedit  a b c d e f Darrell D.
