Additional sources include the Hebrew Bible other Jewish religious texts and native Iranian sources. According to Herodotus the Achaemenids were a clan of the Pasargadae tribe These were the leading tribes on which all the other Persians were dependent namely the Pasargadae Maraphians and Maspioi. Of these the Pasargadae are the most noble and include the family of Achaemenids the Kings of Persia who are descendants of Perseus.5 Darius the Great in an effort to establish his legitimacy later traced his genealogy to Achaemenes Persian Haxmani.6 His son was given as Teispes and from him came in turn Ariaramnes Arsames and Hystaspes. However there is no historical evidence for any of these.7 Dynastyedit See also Achaemenid family tree The Persian Empire was a hereditary monarchy though the spirit of eldest son succession was often violated through palace intrigues. The historical kings as given in Greek sources are Achaemenid rulers Cyrus I late
