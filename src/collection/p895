He was elevated to throne as coregent by his father Senusret III with whom he shared the throne as the active king for twenty years. During his reign Egypt attained its cultural and economic zenith of the Middle Kingdom. The aggressive military and domestic policies of Senusret III which resubjugated Nubia and wrested power from the nomarchs allowed Amenemhat III to inherit a stable and peaceful Egypt. He directed his efforts towards an extensive building program with particular focus on Faiyum. Here he dedicated a temple to Sobek a chapel to Renenutet erected two colossal statues of himself in Biahmu and contributed to excavation of Lake Moeris. He built for himself two pyramids at Dahshur and Hawara becoming the first pharaoh since Sneferu in the Fourth Dynasty to build more than one. Near to his Hawara pyramid is a pyramid for his daughter Neferuptah. To acquire resources for the building program Amenemhat III exploited the quarries of Egypt and the Sinai for turquoise and copper. Other exploited sites includes the schist quarries at Wadi Hammamat amethyst from Wadi elHudi fine limestone from Tura alabaster from Hatnub red granite from Aswan and diorite from Nubia. A large corpus of inscriptions attest to the activities at these sites particularly at Serabit elKhadim. There is scant evidence of military expeditions during his reign though a small one is attested at Kumma in his ninth regnal year. He also sent a handful of expeditions to Punt. Amenemhat III reigned for at least 45 years though a papyrus fragment from ElLahun mentioning a 
46 th year probably dates to his reign as well. Toward the end of his reign he instituted a coregency with Amenemhat IV as recorded in a rock inscription from Semna in Nubia which equates regnal year 1 of Amenemhat IV to regnal year 44 or 4648 of Amenemhat III. Sobekneferu later succeeded Amenemhat IV as the last ruler of the Twelfth Dynasty. Sourcesedit Contemporaneous sourcesedit There are a variety of contemporary sources attesting to the reign of Amenemhat III. Chief among these are the collection of inscriptions left at mining sites throughout Egypt Nubia and the Sinai peninsula.13 His activities in the Sinai are particularly well attested to spanning regnal years 2 to 
45.1 415 It is notable though that the overwhelming majority of these inscriptions originate outside Egypt.16 He is also well attested to through his statuary with approximately 80 works attributed to him1716 his building program particularly concentrated around Faiyum and the two pyramids that he had built.1415 The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus  one of a limited set of evidence attesting to Egyptian knowledge of mathematics18  is also thought to have been originally composed during Amenemhat IIIs time.19 Historical sourcesedit The Karnak king list from the Festival Hall of Thutmose III c. 14791425 BC10 has a lacuna of two entries between Amenemhat II and Amenemhat IV though three kings are known to have reigned during this period  Senusret II Senusret III and Amenemhat III.20 In the Abydos king list from the temple of Seti I c. 12901279 BC21 in Abydos Amenemhat III is attested by his praenomen Nimaatre in the sixtyfourth entry.22 His praenomen also occupies the sixtyfourth entry in the king list at the temple of Ramesses II c. 12791213 BC21 in Abydos.23 In the Saqqara Tablet from the tomb of the chief lector priest and chief of works Tjuneroy Amenemhat IIIs praenomen occupies the twentieth entry.2425 The Turin Canon has a lacuna in the midTwelfth Dynasty preserving no names and only partial reign lengths. The twentyfifth entry of the fifth column corresponding to Amenemhat III preserves only a regnal length of 
40 x years.12627 The entries of his presumed children and immediate successors  Amenemhat IV and Sobekneferu  are nearwholly intact preserving their praenomen and reign lengths.127 Amenemhat III is also mentioned in Manethos Aegyptiaca originally composed circa the 
3 rd century BC tentatively dated to the reign of Ptolemy II.282930 The original work is no longer extant but has persisted through the writings of Josephus Africanus Eusebius and Syncellus.31 He is accorded a reign of 8 years under the name  romanized Lachars  Lamars by both Africanus and Eusebius.32 Syncellus accords him a reign of 43 years under the name  romanized Mars as the thirtyfifth king of Thebes.
33 b Familyedit See also Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt family tree Pectoral of Amenemhat III from the tomb of Mereret at Dahshur one of his sisters Amenemhat III was the son of Senusret III his predecessor on the throne.4 There is no explicit testimony to this filial relationship however the inference can be made from their coregency.35 The identity of his mother is unknown.36 He had several sisters  Menet Mereret Senetsenbetes Sithathor and a partially known Khnemet.37 Two of Amenemhat IIIs wives are known Aat and Khenemetneferhedjet III who were both buried in his Pyramid at Dahshur.3839 Hetepti  the mother of Amenemhat IV  might be another wife.36 He had one confirmed daughter Neferuptah who appears to have been groomed as his successor owing to her name being enclosed in cartouche.40 The Egyptologists Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton indicate that Neferuptah was originally buried at Amenemhat IIIs second pyramid at Hawara but was eventually moved to her own pyramid after an early death.40 The Egyptologist Wolfram Grajetzki contradicts this stating that she was never buried in Hawara but had possibly outlived her father and was buried elsewhere as a result.36 Two other children both of whom reigned as king are also attributed to Amenemhat III a son Amenemhat IV and a daughter Sobekneferu.41 It has also been suggested that Amenemhat IV may instead have been a grandson.42 Evidence of burials of three other princesses  Hathorhotep Nubhotep and Sithathor  were found at the Dahshur complex but it is not clear whether these princesses were Amenemhat IIIs daughters as the complex was used for royal burials throughout the Thirteenth Dynasty.43 Reignedit Chronologyedit The relative chronology of rulers in the Twelfth Dynasty is considered settled.44 The Ramesside king lists and the Turin Canon are a significant source in determining the relative chronology of the rulers.45 The Turin Canon has a lacuna of four lines between Amenemhat I and Amenemhat IV recording only partial regnal lengths for the four kings  
10 x 19 
30 x and 
40 x years respectively.2746 The king lists of Seti I and Ramesses II at Abydos and the Saqqara tablet each list Amenemhat III with Senusret III  whose praenomen is Khakaure11  as his predecessor and Amenemhat IV  whose praenomen is Maakherure11  as his successor.474849 Instead Egyptological debate has centred on the existence of coregencies.44 Coregencyedit Amenemhat III as a recumbent sphinx one of the socalled Hyksos sphinxes In his twentieth regnal year Senusret III elevated his son Amenemhat III to the status of coregent.50 The coregency seems to be established from several indicatorsc though not all scholars agree and somed instead argue for sole reigns for both kings.58 For the following twenty years Senusret III and Amenemhat III shared the throne with Amenemhat III taking the active role as king.59460 It is assumed that Amenemhat III took the primary role as the regnal dates roll over from year 19 of Senusret III to year 1 of Amenemhat III.6059 His reign is attested for at least 45 years though a papyrus fragment from ElLahun mentioning regnal year 46 month 1 of akhet day 22 probably dates to his rule as well5961 since the village was founded by Amenemhat IIIs grandfather Senusret II and no other Twelfth Dynasty ruler after Senusret II reigned for more than 40 years. The highest date might be found on a bowl from Elephantine bearing regnal year 46 month 3 of peret. This attribution is favoured by the Egyptologist Cornelius von Pilgrim but rejected by the Egyptologist Wolfram Grajetzki who places it in the early Middle Kingdom.62 In his 
30 th regnal year Amenemhat III celebrated his Sed festival which is mentioned in several inscriptions.63 His reign ends with a brief coregency with his successor Amenemhat IV.5964 This is evidenced from a rock inscription at Semna which equates regnal year 1 of Amenemhat IV with regnal year 44 or perhaps 4648 of Amenemhat III.596566 These two kings  Senusret III and Amenemhat III  presided over the golden age of the Middle Kingdom. Senusret III had pursued aggressive military action to curb incursions from tribes people from Nubia.467 These campaigns were conducted across several years and were brutal against the native populations including slaughter of men enslavement of women and children and the burning of fields.68 He also sent a military expedition into SyriaPalestine enemies of Egypt since the reign of Senusret I.6769 His internal policies targeted the increasing power of provincial governors transferring power back to the reigning monarch.704 It is disputed whether he dismantled the nomarchical system.69 Senusret III also formed the basis for the legendary character Sesostris described by Manetho and Herodotus.7168 As a consequence of Senusret IIIs administrative and military policies Amenemhat III inherited a peaceful and stable Egypt4 which reached its cultural and economic zenith under his direction.64916 Military campaignsedit There is very little evidence for military expeditions during Amenemhat IIIs reign. One rock inscription records a small mission in regnal year nine. It was found in Nubia near the fortress of Kumma. The short text reports that a military mission was guided by the mouth of Nekhen Zamonth who states that he went north with a small troop and that there were no deaths on the return south.72 There is a stela dated to regnal 33 that was discovered at Kerma south of the Third Cataract discussing the construction of a wall though this stela must have originated elsewhere as Kerma was beyond Egypts control at this time.63 Mining expeditionsedit Sinai mines Tura Gebel Zeit Hatnub Wadi Hammamat Aswan Wadi elHudi Gebel elAsr classnotpageimage Mining sites in Amenemhat IIIs reign Exploitation of the quarries of Egypt and the Sinai for turquoise and copper peaked during his reign.64 A collection of more than 50 texts were inscribed at Serabit elKhadim Wadi Maghara and Wadi Nasb.6414 The efforts here were so extensive that nearpermanent settlements formed around them.6473 The quarries at Wadi Hammamat schist Wadi elHudi amethyst Tura limestone Hatnub alabaster Aswan red granite and throughout Nubia diorite were all also exploited.647475 These all translated into an extensive building program particularly in the development of Faiyum.6473 Sinai peninsulaedit Amenemhat IIIs activities in the Sinai peninsula are wellattested.6414 There were expeditions to Wadi Maghara in regnal years 2 30 and 4143 with one further expedition in an indiscernible 20  x year.76 The temple of Hathor was decorated during the expedition in year 2 which is also the only expedition for which the mining of copper is attested.77 A related inscription found in Ayn Soukhna suggests that the mission originated from Memphis and perhaps crossed the Red Sea to the peninsula by boat.78 A single expedition in Wadi Nasb is attested to his 
20 th regnal year.79 Between 18 and 20 expeditions to Serabit elKhadim have been attested to Amenemhat IIIs reign80 in years 2 48 13 15 20 23 25 27 30 38 40 44 possibly also 18 29 and 45 alongside a 10  x and x  17 years and there are many inscriptions whose date is indeterminable.81 Egyptedit One of the naos from the funerary temple of Amenemhat III at Hawara now located in the Egyptian Museum at Cairo. The left figure flexing his arm across his chest in order to bring a sign ankh life to the face of his partner is Amenemhat III. The king on the right is his son and sucessor Amenemhat IV. One inscription dating to year 43 of Amenemhat IIIs reign comes from Tura and refers to the quarrying of limestone there for a mortuary temple either that at Dahshur or Hawara.82 A stela retrieved from the massif of Gebel Zeit 50 km 31 mi south of Ras Ghareb on the Red Sea coast shows activity at the Galena mines there. The stela bears a partial date suggesting that it was inscribed after regnal year 
10.8 384 Several expeditions to Wadi Hammamat where schist was quarried were recorded.6485 These date to regnal years 2 3 19 20 and 
33.8 5 Three inscriptions from year 19 note the workforce of labourers and soldiers employed and the outcome of the efforts resulting in ten 
2.6  m 
8.5  ft tall seated statues of the king being made. The statues were destined for the Labyrinth at Hawara.8286 A few expeditions were sent to Wadi elHudi southeast of Aswan at the southern border of Egypt where amethyst was collected. These enterprises date to regnal years 1 11 20 and 
28.8 78889 An expedition was also sent to Wadi Abu Agag near Aswan in regnal year 
13.9 0 Nubiaedit Northwest of Abu Simbel and west of Lake Nasser lie the quarries of Gebel elAsr in Lower Nubia. The site is best known as the source of diorite for six of Khafres seated statues. The locale was also a source of gneiss and chalcedony in the Middle Kingdom.91 The Chalcedony deposits are also known as stela ridge as it was a place where commemorative stelae and votive offerings were left.92 Nine of these commemorative objects date to the reign of Amenemhat III specifically regnal years 2 and 
4.9 3 Trade expeditionsedit A stela was discovered at Mersa on the Red Sea coast by Rosanna Pirelli in 2005 that detailed an expedition to Punt during the reign of Amenemhat III. The expedition was organized by chief steward Senbef. Under his direction two contingents were formed. The first was led by an Amenhotep and bound for Punt to acquire incense. The second led by a Nebesu was sent to the mines referred to as BiaPunt to procure exotic metals.9495 There were a total of between two and five expeditions organized during Amenemhat IIIs rule.96 Two of the stelae recovered from the site are dated indicating activity there in his 
23 rd and 
41 st regnal years.97 Building programedit Amenemhat IIIs building program included monuments in Khatana Tell elYahudiyya and Bubastis.4 At Bubastis Amenemhat III probably built a palace which hosts relief art containing his name. Of note is a relief that depicts Amenemhat III officiating his sedfestival.13 Further works include the enlargement of the temples to Hathor at Serabit elKhadim and Ptah in Memphis the construction of a temple in Quban and the reinforcement of fortresses at Semna.649 At Elephantine a fragment of stela bearing a building inscription was found dated to his regnal year 44. A very similar inscription from possibly the same year was found at Elkab which indicates the extension of a defensive wall built by Senusret II. Another find at Elephantine was a door lintel of the Eleventh Dynasty where Amenemhat III added an inscription dated to his regnal year 34. Inscriptions with the kings name have also been uncovered at Lisht Memphis and Heracleopolis and statues of the king were found in Thebes.13 No site however received as much attention as Faiyum with which Amenemhat III is most closely associated.644 In Faiyum Amenemhat built a huge temple dedicated to Sobek at Kiman Faras.916 He dedicated a chapel to Renenutet at Medinet Madi.64 This small temple with three chapels is the best preserved of his temple works. It was built toward the end of his reign and completed by his successor Amenemhat IV.13 In Biahmu he built a massive structure with two colossal 12 m 39 ft tall seated quartzite statues of himself.98734 These face Lake Moeris for which he is credited with excavating although how much of this work was conducted by Amenemhat III is unknown.734 The work on Lake Moeris had been inaugurated by Senusret II to link the Faiyum Depression with Bahr Yussef.99 This project reclaimed land downstream at the edges of Lake Moeris allowing it to be farmed.100 A naturally formed valley 16 km 
9.9  mi long and 
1.5  km 
0.9 3 mi wide was converted into a canal to link the depression with Bahr Yussef. The canal was cut to a depth of 5 m 16 ft and given sloped banks at a ratio of 110 and an average inclination of 
0.0 1 along its length.101 It is known as MerWer or the Great Canal.102 The area continued to be used until 230 BC when the Lahun branch of the Nile silted up.103 Amenemhat III kept close watch on the inundation levels of the Nile as demonstrated by inscriptions left at Kumma and Semna. The Nile level peaked in his regnal year 30 at 
5.1  m 17 ft but was followed by a dramatic decline so that it measured 
0.5  m 
1.6  ft by regnal year 
40.7 4 The most enduring of his works are the two pyramids that he built for himself64 the first king since Sneferu in the Fourth Dynasty to build more than one.104 His pyramids are in Dahshur and Hawara.64105 Inscriptions by Amenemhat III in the chapel of Renenutet Limestone recumbent lion statue at the temple in Medinet Madi Pyramidsedit Dahshuredit See also Pyramid of Amenemhat III Dahshur The Black Pyramid of Amenemhat III The construction of the pyramid at Dahshur the Black Pyramid Egyptian language Sm mnmht meaning Amenemhat is Mighty106 or Nfr mnmht meaning Amenemhat is Beautiful1
07 Perfect One of Amenemhat108 began in the first year of Amenemhat IIIs reign.106109 The pyramid core was constructed entirely of mudbrick and stabilized through the building of a stepped core rather than with a stone framework.110109 The structure was then encased by 5 m 16 ft 
9.5  cu thick fine white Tura limestone blocks held together by wooden dovetail pegs.110 The pyramid was given a base length of 105 metres 344 ft 200 cu that was inclined towards the apex at between 5430 to 571550 reaching a height of 75 m 246 ft 143 cu for a total volume of 274625 m3 9698300 cu ft.111112 The apogee of the structure was crowned seemingly by a grey granite pyramidion 
1.3  m 
4.3  ft high.113 This now resides in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo catalogued as JE 351
33.1 14 The pyramidion had a band of hieroglyphic text running on all four of its sides.115 That the name of Amun has been erased on the pyramidion can only be the result of Akhenatens proscription against the god.114 The pyramidion of the Black Pyramid In front of the pyramid lay a mortuary temple of simple design comprising an offering hall and an open columned courtyard. Surrounding the complex were two mudbrick enclosing walls. From the mortuary temple an open mudbrick walled causeway led to the valley temple.116 Beneath the pyramid was built a substructure with an intricate series of passages and chambers with burial chambers for the king and two queens.117114 The two queens Aat and an unidentified queen were buried here and their remains were recovered from their chambers.118115 The king though was not buried here.119 Shortly after the completion of the pyramid superstructure in around Amenemhat IIIs 
15 th regnal year the substructure began to buckle with cracks appearing inside as a result of groundwater seepage.119120 Rushed efforts were made to prevent the structure collapsing which were successful but just as Sneferu had decided to do with his Bent Pyramid Amenemhat III chose to build a new one.120 Hawaraedit The pyramid of Amenemhat III at Hawara The second pyramid is at Hawara Egyptian language Uncertain possibly n mnmht Amenemhat Lives120 in the Faiyum Oasis.121 This pyramid project was begun around Amenemhat IIIs 
15 th regnal year after problems with the Dahshur pyramid persisted.36120 The choice of Hawara suggests that the cultivation of Faiyum was complete and that Amenemhat III was diverting resources to that area.122 The pyramid had a core constructed entirely of mudbrick encased in fine white Tura limestone.123120 The pyramid had a base length of between 102 m 335 ft 195 cu and 105 m 344 ft 200 cu with a shallower inclination of between 48 and 52 up to a peak height 58 m 190 ft 111 cu for a total volume of 200158 m3 7068500 cu ft.111112 The shallower inclination angle was a step taken to guard against the threat of a collapse and avoid a repeat of the failure at Dahshur.120 Inside the substructure builders took further precautions such as lining chamber pits with limestone.123 The burial chamber was chiselled out of a single quartzite block measuring 7 m 23 ft by 
2.5  m 
8.2  ft by 
1.8 3 m 
6.0  ft and weighing over 100 t 110 short tons.123120 Before the pyramid lay a mortuary temple that has been identified as the Labyrinth which Classical travellers such as Herodotus and Strabo referred to and which was said to have inspired the Labyrinth of Minos.124120 The temple was destroyed in antiquity and can only be partially reconstructed.124120 Its floorplan covered an estimated 28000 m2 300000 sq ft.124 According to Strabos account the temple contained as many rooms as there were nomes in Egypt125 while Herodotus wrote about being led from courtyards into rooms rooms into galleries galleries into more rooms thence into more courtyards.120 A limestone statue of Sobek and another of Hathor were discovered here125 as were two granite shrines each containing two statues of Amenemhat III.120 A northsouth oriented perimeter wall enclosed the entire complex125 which thus measured 385 m 1263 ft by 158 m 518 ft.120 The causeway has been identified near the southwest corner of the complex but neither it nor the valley temple have been investigated.126 Neferuptahedit The pyramid of Neferuptah was built 2 km 
1.2  mi southeast of Amenemhat IIIs Hawara pyramid. It was excavated by Nagib Farag and Zaky Iskander in 19
56.1 27 The superstructure of the pyramid is near completely lost and the substructure was found full of groundwater but her burial was otherwise undisturbed including both her sarcophagus and funerary equipment.128 Sculptureedit Amenemhat III and Sensuret III are the best attested rulers of the Middle Kingdom by number of statues with about 80 statues that can be assigned to the former. The sculpture of Amenemhat III continued the tradition of Senusret III though it pursued a more natural and expressive physiognomy while retaining an idealized image.129 A wide range of stones were used for the sculpture of the king include white limestone obsidian chalcedony and copper alloy.130 Furthermore the king introduced new and reinterpreted types of sculptures many of which were inspired by far older works.17 Two broad facial types can be assigned to Amenemhat III. An expressive style in which the face of the king has its musculature bone structure and furrows clearly marked. This style is evidently inspired by the sculpture of Senusret III. A humanized style in which the face is simplified with few or no folds or furrows and averse to sharp transitions between features. These have a generally softer more youthful expression.131 A sculpture of the expressive type in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek Copenhagen A sculpture of the humanized type in the Staatliches Museum gyptischer Kunst Munich Halflifesized head in mottled diorite from the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology London Amenemhat III dressed in panther skin from the Egyptian Museum Cairo A damaged portrait sculpture of Amenemhat III in the gyptisches Museum Berlin Berlin Granite statue in the Egyptian Collection of the Hermitage Museum St. Petersburg Egyptian alabaster statuette head of Amenemhat III from the Louvre Paris A intace portrait sculpture of Amenemhat III in the Luxor Museum Luxor Officialsedit The vizier Kheti Hty held office around year 29 of Amenemhat IIIs reign132 as is attested on a papyrus from elLahun.133 The papyrus is a business document authored by the vizier in his office discussing payment of two brothers named Ahyseneb hysnb for their services.134 At that time one brother Ahyseneb Ankhren nrn was an assistant to the treasurer yet on a later papyrus containing his will dated to year 44 of Amenemhat IIIs reign he had become the director of works.135136 This latter papyrus contains two dates year 44 month II of Shemu day 13 and year 2 month II of Akhet day 
18.1 37 The latter date refers to the reign of either Amenemhat IV or Sobekneferu.138 There is one other hieratic text and also a limestone table on which Ahyseneb Ankhren is attested.136 The other brother Ahyseneb Wah W was a wabpriest and superintendent of priestly orders of Sepdu lord of the East.133139 A further vizier datable to the reign was Ameny mny.140 Ameny is attested on two rock inscriptions from Aswan.141 The first found by Flinders Petrie on the road between Philae and Aswan142 and the second found by Jacques de Morgan on the right bank of the river nile between Bar and Aswan.143 The inscriptions bear the names of his family members141 including his wife Sehotepibre Nehy Stpbr Ny who is also attested on a stela in Copenhagen National Museum.144 Khnumhotep Hnmwtp was an official that held office for at least three decades from Senusret IIs first regnal year through to Amenemhat IIIs reign.145 At the beginning of Senusret IIs reign he was a chamberlain but by the end of his life he held both the office of vizier and chief steward.146 His tomb in Dahshur also attests to many other titles including high official royal sealbearer chief lectorpriest master of secrets and overseer of the city.147148 The treasurer Ikhernofret Yrnfrt was still in office in the early years of the kings reign149 as is demonstrated by a funerary stela in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.150 This official is among the best attested for the Middle Kingdom though there is little known of his family.149 His funerary stela is dated to Amenemhat IIIs first regnal year and bears his name along with three of his titles sealbearer of the King of Lower Egypt sole friend of the king and treasurer.151152 The treasurer is mentioned on the funerary stela of an Ameny mny chief of staff of the bureau of the vizier. The latter part of the stela tells of the attendance of Ikhernofret and Sasetet Sst at a feast in Abydos at the instruction of Senusret III after a campaign against Nubia in his regnal year 
19.1 53154 Ameny is also mentioned on the stela of Sasetet dating to the first year of Amenemhat III where he still held the same position.155156 Sasetet holds the title chief of staff of the bureau of the treasurer in that stela.155 Another treasurer under Amenemhat III is Senusretankh Snwsrtn who is known from his recently uncovered mastaba at Dahshur near the pyramid of Senusret III. The surviving fragments of a red granite offering table recovered from the tomb bear the birth and throne names of Amenemhat III. The table further bears numerous other epithets and titles with which the owner connects himself to the king.157 Another chief steward Senbef Snbf is known from an expedition stela found at Mersa and from a papyrus document.158 The stela contains an image of Amenemhat III presenting offerings to the god Min.159 Behind the king stands another official Nebsu Nbsw the Overseer of the Cabinet of the Head of the South effectively meaning that he was the head of a workforce. Beneath the image are inscriptions recording two expeditions to Punt alongside the names of the expedition leaders. The leads of the two expeditions are Nebsu himself and his brother Amenhotep mnhtp holding the title of scribe in charge of the seal of the treasury.160161 See alsoedit List of pharaohs Notesedit  Proposed dates for the reign of Amenemhat III c. 18591813 BC2 c. 18441797 BC3 c. 18431797 BC4 c. 18421797 BC56 c. 18421794 BC7 c. 18311786 BC89 c. 18181773 BC.10  Syncellus attributes his list to Apollodorus whom himself attributed to Eratosthenes and himself attributed to the scribes of Diospolis but which is ultimately supposed to originate from none of these and was instead derived from an Egyptian king list.34  These include The presence of double dates that appear to conflate the reigns of two kings.5152 The conaming of two kings present on many artefacts but without dates. This is weak evidence as it is not unusual for two kings one living and one deceased to be named together.53 Singledated monuments during the assumed period of corule favour the junior partner and this is suggested to indicate the quasiretirement of the elder king.54 Textual evidence for coregency but it is scant indirect and of malleable interpretation.55  Such as the Egyptologists Robert Delia Claude Obsomer and Pierre Tallet.5657 Referencesedit  a b c Schneider 2006 pp. 173174.
