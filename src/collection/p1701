35 th session Reference no. 1336 Region Africa Mero mroi1 also spelled Meroe2 Meroitic Medewi Arabic  romanized Meruwah and  Meruwi Ancient Greek  romanized Mer was an ancient city on the east bank of the Nile about 6 km northeast of the Kabushiya station near Shendi Sudan approximately 200 km northeast of Khartoum. Near the site is a group of villages called Bagrawiyah Arabic . This city was the capital of the Kingdom of Kush for several centuries from around 590 BC until its collapse in the 
4 th century AD. The Kushitic Kingdom of Mero gave its name to the Island of Mero which was the modern region of Butana a region bounded by the Nile from the Atbarah River to Khartoum the Atbarah and the Blue Nile. The city of Mero was on the edge of Butana. There were two other Meroitic cities in Butana Musawwarat esSufra and Naqa.34 The first of these sites was given the name Mero by the Persian king Cambyses in honor of his sister who was called by that name. The city had originally borne the ancient appellation Saba named after the countrys original founder.5 The eponym Saba or Seba is named for one of the sons of Cush see Genesis 107. The presence of numerous Meroitic sites within the western Butana region and on the border of Butana proper is significant to the settlement of the core of the developed region. The orientation of these settlements exhibit the exercise of state power over subsistence production.6 The Kingdom of Kush which housed the city of Mero represents one of a series of early states located within the middle Nile. It was one of the earliest and most advanced states found on the African continent. Looking at the specificity of the surrounding early states within the middle Nile ones understanding of Mero in combination with the historical developments of other historic states may be enhanced through looking at the development of power relation characteristics within other Nile Valley states.6 The site of the city of Mero is marked by more than two hundred pyramids in three groups of which many are in ruins. They have the distinctive size and proportions of Nubian pyramids. Historyedit mjrwjwt7 in hieroglyphs Near East in 200 BC showing the Kingdom of Mero and its neighbours. Mero was the southern capital of the Kingdom of Kush. The Kingdom of Kush spanned the period c. 800 BC  c. 350 AD initially its main capital was farther north at Napata.8 King Aspelta moved the capital to Mero considerably farther south than Napata possibly c. 591 BC9 just after the sack of Napata by Egyptian Pharaoh Psamtik II. Martin Meredith states the Kushite rulers chose Mero between the Fifth and Sixth Cataracts because it was on the fringe of the summer rainfall belt and the area was rich in iron ore and hardwood for iron working. The location also afforded access to trade routes to the Red Sea. The city of Mero was located along the middle Nile which is of much importance due to the annual flooding of the Nile river valley and the connection to many major river systems such as the Niger which aided with the production of pottery and iron characteristic to the Meroitic kingdom that allowed for the rise in power of its people.6 According to partially deciphered Meroitic texts the name of the city was Medewi. First Meroitic Period 542315 BCedit The Kings ruled over Napata and Mero. The seat of government and the royal palace were in Mero. The Main temple of Amun was located in Napata. Kings and many queens are buried in Nuri some queens are buried in Mero in the West Cemetery.10 The earliest king was Analmaye 542538 BC and the last king of the first phase is Nastasen 335315 BC In the fifth century BC Greek historian Herodotus described it as a great city...said to be the mother city of the other Ethiopians.1112 Excavations revealed evidence of important high ranking Kushite burials from the Napatan Period c. 800  c. 280 BC in the vicinity of the settlement called the Western Cemetery. The importance of the town gradually increased from the beginning of the Meroitic Period especially from the reign of Arakamani c. 280 BC when the royal burial ground was transferred to Mero from Napata Gebel Barkal. Royal burials formed the Pyramids of Mero containing the remains of the Kings and Queens of Mero from c. 300 BC to about 350 AD.13 Karkamanis pyramid 513503 BC Nuri Jewelry found on the mummy of Nubian King Amaninatakilebte 538519 BC.

1 st century AD Conflict with Romeedit Romes conquest of Egypt led to border skirmishes and incursions by Mero beyond the Roman borders. In 23 BC in response to a Nubian attack on southern Egypt the Roman governor of Egypt Publius Petronius invaded Nubia to end the Meroitic raids. He pillaged northern Nubia and sacked Napata 22 BC before returning home. In retaliation the Nubians crossed the lower border of Egypt and looted many statues from the Egyptian towns near the first cataract of the Nile at Aswan. Roman forces later reclaimed many of the statues intact and others were returned following the peace treaty signed in 22 BC between Rome and Mero under Augustus and Amanirenas respectively. One looted head from a statue of the emperor Augustus was buried under the steps of a temple it is now kept in the British Museum.14 Relief of Kandake Amanitore circa 50 AD The next recorded contact between Rome and Mero was in the autumn of 61 AD. The Emperor Nero sent a party of Praetorian soldiers under the command of a tribune and two centurions into this country who reached the city of Mero where they were given an escort then proceeded up the White Nile until they encountered the swamps of the Sudd. This marked the limit of Roman penetration into Africa.15 The period following Petronius punitive expedition is marked by abundant trade finds at sites in Mero. L. P. Kirwan provides a short list of finds from archeological sites in that country.15

4 th century AD. The Aksumite presence was short lived before Mero was taken by the Kingdom of Alodia. A stele of Geez of an unnamed ruler of the Kingdom of Aksum thought to be Ezana was found at the site of Mero from its description in Greek he was King of the Aksumites and the Omerites i.e. of Aksum and Himyar it is likely this king ruled sometime around 3

00.2 2 Mero in Jewish legendedit Jewish oral tradition avers that Moses in his younger years had led an Egyptian military expedition into Sudan Kush as far as the city of Mero which was then called Saba. The city was built near the confluence of two great rivers and was encircled by a formidable wall and governed by a renegade king. To ensure the safety of his men who traversed that desert country Moses had invented a stratagem whereby the Egyptian army would carry along with them baskets of sedge each containing an ibis only to be released when they approached the enemys country. The purpose of the birds was to kill the deadly serpents that lay all about that country.5 Having successfully laid siege to the city the city was eventually subdued by the betrayal of the kings daughter who had agreed to deliver the city to Moses on condition that he would consummate a marriage with her under the solemn assurance of an oath.a Civilizationedit Meroitic script Mero was the base of a flourishing kingdom whose wealth was centered around a strong iron industry as well as international trade involving India and China.23 Metalworking is believed to have taken place in Mero possibly through bloomeries and blast furnaces.24 Archibald Sayce reportedly referred to it as the Birmingham of Africa25 because of perceived vast production and trade of iron a contention that is a matter of debate in modern scholarship.
25 dubious  discuss The centralized control of production within the Meroitic empire and distribution of certain crafts and manufactures may have been politically important with their iron industry and pottery crafts gaining the most significant attention. The Meroitic settlements were oriented in a savannah orientation with the varying of permanent and less permanent agricultural settlements can be attributed to the exploitation of rainlands and savannahoriented forms of subsistence.6 At the time iron was one of the most important metals worldwide and Meroitic metalworkers were among the best in the world. Mero traded ivory slaves rare skins ostrich feathers copper and ebony.26 Mero also exported textiles and jewelry. Their textiles were based on cotton and working on this product reached its highest achievement in Nubia around 400 BC. Furthermore Nubia was very rich in gold. It is possible that the Egyptian word for gold nub was the source of name of Nubia. Trade in exotic animals from farther south in Africa was another feature of their economy. Apart from the iron trade pottery was a widespread and prominent industry in the Mero kingdom. The production of fine and elaborately decorated wares was a strong tradition within the middle Nile. Such productions carried considerable social significance and are believed to be involved in mortuary rites. The long history of goods imported into the Meroitic empire and their subsequent distribution provides insight into the social and political workings of the Meroitic state. The major determinant of production was attributed to the availability of labor rather than the political power associated with land. Power was associated with control of people rather than control of territory.6 The sakia was used to move water in conjunction with irrigation to increase crop production.27 At its peak the rulers of Mero controlled the Nile Valley north to south over a straightline distance of more than 1000 km 620 mi.28 The King of Mero was an autocratic ruler who shared his authority only with the Queen Mother or Candace. However the role of the Queen Mother remains obscure. The administration consisted of treasurers seal bearers heads of archives and chief scribes among others. Although the people of Mero also had southern deities such as Apedemak the lionson of Sekhmet or Bast depending upon the region they also continued worshipping ancient Egyptian gods that they had brought with them. Among these deities were Amun Tefnut Horus Isis Thoth and Satis though to a lesser extent. The collapse of their external trade with other Nile Valley states may be considered one of the prime causes of the decline of royal power and disintegration of the Meroitic state in the 
3 rd and 
4 th centuries AD.6 Languageedit Stamp or thumb ring in the form of three cartouches enclosing dot pattern. Each topped with two plumes and sun disc. Faience. From Mero. Meroitic period. Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology The Meroitic language was spoken in Mero and the Sudan during the Meroitic period attested from 300 BC. It became extinct around 400 AD. The language was written in two forms of the Meroitic alphabet Meroitic Cursive which was written with a stylus and was used for general recordkeeping and Meroitic Hieroglyphic which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of bilingual texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180 and 170 BC. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen Shanakdakhete. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally and reads from right to left like all Semitic orthographies.29 By the 
3 rd century BC a new indigenous alphabet the Meroitic consisting of twentythree letters replaced Egyptian script. The Meroitic script is an alphabetic script originally derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs used to write the Meroitic language of the Kingdom of Kush. It was developed in the Napatan Period c. 700  300 BC and first appears in the 
2 nd century BC. For a time it was also possibly used to write the Nubian language of the successor Nubian kingdoms.30 It is uncertain to which language family the Meroitic language is related. Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic like the Egyptian language belongs to the AfroAsiatic family. She bases this on its sound inventory and phonotactics which she proposes are similar to those of the AfroAsiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the NiloSaharan languages.3132 Claude Rilly based on its syntax morphology and known vocabulary proposes that Meroitic like the Nobiin language instead belongs to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the NiloSaharan family.333435 Archaeologyedit For a more comprehensive list see Pyramids of Mero. Plan of the North pyramid field at Mero. The site of Mero was brought to the knowledge of Europeans in 1821 by the French mineralogist Frdric Cailliaud 17871869 who published an illustrated infolio describing the ruins. His work included the first publication of the southernmost known Latin inscription.b As Margoliouth notes in the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica small scale excavations occurred in 1834 led by Giuseppe Ferlini2 who as Margoliouth states discovered or professed to discover various antiquities chiefly in the form of jewelry now in the museums of Berlin and Munich.2 Margoliouth continues The ruins were examined in 1844 by C. R. Lepsius who brought many plans sketches and copies besides actual antiquities to Berlin. Further excavations were carried on by E. A. Wallis Budge in the years 1902 and 1905 the results of which are recorded in his work The Egyptian Sudan its History and Monuments37 Troops were furnished by Sir Reginald Wingate governor of the Sudan who made paths to and between the pyramids and sank shafts c. It was found that the pyramids were regularly built over sepulchral chambers containing the remains of bodies either burned or buried without being mummified. The most interesting objects found were the reliefs on the chapel walls already described by Lepsius and containing the names with representations of queens and some kings with some chapters of the Book of the Dead some steles with inscriptions in the Meroitic language and some vessels of metal and earthenware. The best of the reliefs were taken down stone by stone in 1905 and set up partly in the British Museum and partly in the museum at Khartoum. In 1910 in consequence of a report by Professor Archibald Sayce excavations were commenced in the mounds of the town and the necropolis by John Garstang on behalf of the University of Liverpool and the ruins of a palace and several temples were discovered built by the Meroite kings.2 Column and elephant  part of temple complex in Musawwarat esSufra Roman Kiosk and Apedemak Temple in Naqa Colonnade of rams in front of AmunRa temple in Naqa World Heritage listingedit A modern satellite view of the region of Mero October 2020 In June 2011 the Archeological Sites of Mero were listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites.3 See alsoedit Sedeinga pyramids List of modern names for biblical place names Kandake Referencesedit Notesedit  The same episode with slight variation is also related in Sefer HaYashar TelAviv ca. 1965 pp. 192195 Hebrew and in Gedaliah ibn Yahyas Shalshelet HaKabbalah Jerusalem 1962 p. 22 p. 31 in PDF Hebrew PseudoJonathan  the Aramaic Targum of pseudoJonathan ben Uziel ed.
