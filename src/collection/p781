The title is already attested in the First Dynasty one of the first holders was Merka2 official under king Qaa. In the New Kingdom the title was often the crown prince and the title announced that the holder was the second ruler in the country. It is therefore sometimes translated as Hereditary or Crown Prince. Under Tutankhamun Horemheb was officially designated the irypat or successor to this pharaoh but did not succeed the boy king since Ay intervened to seize the throne instead for about 4 years before Horemheb assumed power as pharaoh.
