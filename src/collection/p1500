This scene from the north wall of Medinet Habu is often used to illustrate the Egyptian campaign against the Sea Peoples in what has come to be known as the Battle of the Delta c.1175 BC1 during the reign of Ramesses III. While accompanying hieroglyphs do not name Egypts enemies describing them simply as being from northern countries early scholars noted the similarities between the hairstyles and accessories worn by the combatants and other reliefs in which such groups are named. The Sea Peoples are a hypothesized seafaring confederation that attacked ancient Egypt and other regions in the East Mediterranean before and during the Late Bronze Age collapse 1200900 BC.23 Following the creation of the concept in the 
19 th century the Sea Peoples incursions became one of the most famous chapters of Egyptian history given its connection with in the words of Wilhelm Max Mller the most important questions of ethnography and the primitive history of classic nations.45 The Sea People included wellattested groups such as the Lukka as well as others such as the Weshesh whose origins are unknown. Hypotheses regarding the origin of the various groups are the source of much speculation. Several of them appear to have been Aegean tribes while others may have originated in Sicily Sardinia Cyprus and Western Anatolia. French Egyptologist Emmanuel de Roug first used the term peuples de la mer literally peoples of the sea in 1855 in a description of reliefs on the Second Pylon at Medinet Habu documenting Year 8 of Ramesses III.67 In the late 
19 th century Gaston Maspero de Rougs successor at the Collge de France subsequently popularized the term Sea Peoples and an associated migration theory.8 Since the early 19
90 s his migration theory has been brought into question by a number of scholars it has been described as a deeply problematic theory and one that has been largely dismissed.2391011 History of the conceptedit A partial description of the hieroglyphic text at Medinet Habu on the right tower of Second Pylon left and an illustration of the prisoners depicted at the base of the Fortified East Gate right were first provided by JeanFranois Champollion following his 182829 travels to Egypt and published posthumously.12 Although Champollion did not label them decades later the hieroglyphs labeled 4 to 8 left were translated as Peleset Tjeker Shekelesh Denyen and Weshesh and the hieroglyphs next to prisoners 3 and 4 second row right translated as Tjeker and Sherden.13 The concept of the Sea Peoples was first articulated by Emmanuel de Roug then curator of the Louvre in his 1855 work Note on Some Hieroglyphic Texts Recently Published by Mr. Greene14 as an interpretation of the battles of Ramesses III described on the Second Pylon at Medinet Habu based upon recent photographs of the temple by John Beasley Greene.151617 De Roug noted that in the crests of the conquered peoples the Sherden and the Teresh bear the designation of the peuples de la mer in a reference to the prisoners depicted at the base of the Fortified East Gate.7 In 1867 de Roug published his Excerpts of a dissertation on the attacks directed against Egypt by the peoples of the Mediterranean in the 
14 th century BC which focused primarily on the battles of Ramesses II and Merneptah and which proposed translations for many of the geographic names included in the hieroglyphic inscriptions.1819 De Roug later became chair of Egyptology at the Collge de France and was succeeded by Gaston Maspero. Maspero built upon de Rougs work and published The Struggle of the Nations20 in which he described the theory of the seaborne migrations in detail in 189596 for a wider audience8 at a time when the idea of population migrations would have felt familiar to the general population.21 The migration theory was taken up by other scholars such as Eduard Meyer and became the generally accepted theory amongst Egyptologists and Orientalists.8 Since the early 19
90 s however it has been brought into question by a number of scholars.23910 The historical narrative stems primarily from seven Ancient Egyptian sources22 and although in these inscriptions the designation of the sea does not appear in relation to all of these peoples210 the term Sea Peoples is commonly used in modern publications to refer to the following nine peoples.2324 Primary documentary recordsedit The Medinet Habu inscriptions from which the Sea Peoples concept was first described remain the primary source and the basis of virtually all significant discussions of them.25 Three separate narratives from Egyptian records refer to more than one of the nine peoples found in a total of six sources. The seventh and most recent source referring to more than one of the nine peoples is a list Onomasticon of 610 entities rather than a narrative.22 These sources are summarized in the table below.

19 th Dynasty operations in or near the delta in Year 2 of his reign and the major confrontation with the Hittite Empire and allies at the Battle of Kadesh in his Year 5. The years of this longlived pharaohs reign are not known exactly but they must have comprised nearly all of the first half of the 
13 th century BC.30 In his Second Year an attack of the Sherden or Shardana on the Nile Delta was repulsed and defeated by Ramesses who captured some of the pirates. The event is recorded on Tanis Stele II.31 An inscription by Ramesses II on the stela from Tanis which recorded the Sherden raiders raid and subsequent capture speaks of the continuous threat they posed to Egypts Mediterranean coasts the unruly Sherden whom no one had ever known how to combat they came boldly sailing in their warships from the midst of the sea none being able to withstand them.32 The Sherden prisoners were subsequently incorporated into the Egyptian army for service on the Hittite frontier by Ramesses and fought as Egyptian soldiers in the Battle of Kadesh. Another stele usually cited in conjunction with this one is the Aswan Stele there were other stelae at Aswan which mentions the kings operations to defeat a number of peoples including those of the Great Green the Egyptian name for the Mediterranean. It is plausible to assume that the Tanis and Aswan Stelae refer to the same event in which case they reinforce each other.citation needed The Battle of Kadesh was the outcome of a campaign against the Hittites and their allies in the Levant in the pharaohs Year 5. The imminent collision of the Egyptian and Hittite empires became obvious to both and they both prepared campaigns against the strategic midpoint of Kadesh for the next year. Ramesses divided his Egyptian forces which were then ambushed piecemeal by the Hittite army and nearly defeated. Ramesses was separated from his forces and had to fight singlehandedly to get back to his troops. He then mustered several counterattacks while waiting for reinforcements. Once the reinforcements from the South and East arrived the Egyptians managed to drive the Hittites back to Kadesh. While it was a strategic Egyptian victory neither side managed to attain their operational objectives.33 At home Ramesses had his scribes formulate an official description which has been called the Bulletin because it was widely published by inscription. Ten copies survive today on the temples at Abydos Karnak Luxor and Abu Simbel with reliefs depicting the battle. The Poem of Pentaur describing the battle also survived.34 The poem relates that the previously captured Sherden were not only working for the Pharaoh but were also formulating a plan of battle for him i.e. it was their idea to divide Egyptian forces into four columns. There is no evidence of any collaboration with the Hittites or malicious intent on their part and if Ramesses considered it he never left any record of that consideration.citation needed The poem lists the peoples who went to Kadesh as allies of the Hittites. Amongst them are some of the sea peoples spoken of in the Egyptian inscriptions previously mentioned and many of the peoples who would later take part in the great migrations of the 
12 th century BC see Appendix A to the Battle of Kadesh.citation needed Merneptah narrativeedit Athribis stele showing all 19 lines and 14 lines on each face.

4 th king of the 
19 th Dynasty was his battle at Perire in the western delta in the 
5 th and 
6 th years of his reign against a confederacy termed the Nine Bows. Depredations of this confederacy had been so severe that the region was forsaken as pasturage for cattle it was left waste from the time of the ancestors.36 The pharaohs action against them is attested in a single narrative found in three sources. The most detailed source describing the battle is the Great Karnak Inscription two shorter versions of the same narrative are found in the Athribis Stele and the Cairo Column.37 The Cairo column is a section of a granite column now in the Cairo Museum which was first published by Maspero in 1881 with just two readable sentences  the first confirming the date of Year 5 and the second stating The wretched chief of Libya has invaded with  being men and women Shekelesh Skrws .3839 The Athribis stela is a granite stela found in Athribis and inscribed on both sides which like the Cairo column was first published by Maspero two years later in 18
83.4 0 The Merneptah Stele from Thebes describes the reign of peace resulting from the victory but does not include any reference to the Sea Peoples.41 The Nine Bows were acting under the leadership of the king of Libya and an associated nearconcurrent revolt in Canaan involving Gaza Ascalon Yenoam and the Israelites. Exactly which peoples were consistently in the Nine Bows is not clear but present at the battle were the Libyans some neighboring Meshwesh and possibly a separate revolt in the following year involving peoples from the eastern Mediterranean including the Kheta or Hittites or Syrians and in the Israel Stele for the first time in history the Israelites. In addition to them the first lines of the Karnak inscription include some sea peoples42 which must have arrived in the Western Delta or from Cyrene by ship Beginning of the victory that his majesty achieved in the land of Libya i Ekwesh Teresh Lukka Sherden Shekelesh Northerners coming from all lands. Later in the inscription Merneptah receives news of the attack ... the third season saying The wretched fallen chief of Libya Meryey son of Ded has fallen upon the country of Tehenu with his bowmen  Sherden Shekelesh Ekwesh Lukka Teresh Taking the best of every warrior and every man of war of his country. He has brought his wife and his children  leaders of the camp and he has reached the western boundary in the fields of Perire His majesty was enraged at their report like a lion assembled his court and gave a rousing speech. Later he dreamed he saw Ptah handing him a sword and saying Take thou it and banish thou the fearful heart from thee. When the bowmen went forth says the inscription Amun was with them as a shield. After six hours the surviving Nine Bows threw down their weapons abandoned their baggage and dependants and ran for their lives. Merneptah states that he defeated the invasion killing 6000 soldiers and taking 9000 prisoners. To be sure of the numbers among other things he took the penises of all uncircumcised enemy dead and the hands of all the circumcised from which history learns that the Ekwesh were circumcised a fact causing some to doubt they were Greek. Ramesses III narrativeedit Further information Battle of the Delta Battle of Djahy and Late Bronze Age collapse Medinet Habu northeast outside wall showing wide view and a closeup sketch of the righthand side relief. Behind the king out of scene is a chariot above which the text describes a battle in Year 8 as follows Now the northern countries which were in their isles were quivering in their bodies. They penetrated the channels of the Niles mouths. Their nostrils have ceased to function so that their desire is to breathe the breath. His majesty is gone forth like a whirlwind against them fighting on the battlefield like a runner. The dread of him and the terror of him have entered in their bodies they are capsized and overwhelmed in their places. Their hearts are taken away their soul is flown away. Their weapons are scattered in the sea. His arrow pierces him whom he has wished among them while the fugitive becomes one fallen into the water. His majesty is like an enraged lion attacking his assailant with his pawns plundering on his right hand and powerful on his left hand like Seth destroying the serpent Evil of Character. It is AmonRe who has overthrown for him the lands and has crushed for him every land under his feet King of Upper and Lower Egypt Lord of the Two Lands UsermareMeriamon.43 Ramesses III who reigned for most of the first half of the 
12 th century BC as the second pharaoh of the 
20 th Dynasty confronted a later wave of invasions of the Sea Peoples in his eighth year. The battles were later recorded in two long inscriptions from his Medinet Habu mortuary temple which are physically separate and somewhat different from one another.44 The Year 8 campaign is the bestrecorded Sea Peoples invasion. The fact that several civilizations collapsed around 1175 BC has led to the suggestion that the Sea Peoples may have been involved at the end of the Hittite Mycenaean and Mitanni kingdoms. The American Hittitologist Gary Beckman writes on page 23 of Akkadica 120 200045 A terminus ante quem for the destruction of the Hittite empire has been recognized in an inscription carved at Medinet Habu in Egypt in the eighth year of Ramesses III 1175 BC. This text narrates a contemporary great movement of peoples in the eastern Mediterranean as a result of which the lands were removed and scattered to the fray. No land could stand before their arms from Hatti Kode Carchemish Arzawa Alashiya on being cut off. ie cut down Ramesses comments about the scale of the Sea Peoples onslaught in the eastern Mediterranean are confirmed by the destruction of the states of Hatti Ugarit Ascalon and Hazor around this time. As the Hittitologist Trevor Bryce observes It should be stressed that the invasions were not merely military operations but involved the movements of large populations by land and sea seeking new lands to settle.46 This situation is confirmed by the Medinet Habu temple reliefs of Ramesses III which show that the Peleset and Tjekker warriors who fought in the land battle against Ramesses III are accompanied in the reliefs by women and children loaded in oxcarts.46 Medinet Habu Second Pylon showing wide view and a closeup sketch of the lefthand side relief in which Amon with Mut behind him extends a sword to Rameses III who is leading three lines of prisoners. The text before the King includes the followingThou puttest great terror of me in the hearts of their chiefs the fear and dread of me before them that I may carry off their warriors phrr bound in my grasp to lead them to thy ka O my august father     . Come to take them being Peleset Pwrst Denyen Dynywn Shekelesh Skrws. Thy strength it was which was before me overthrowing their seed  thy might O lord of gods.47 On the right hand side of the Pylon is the Great Inscription on the Second Pylon which includes the following textThe foreign countries made a conspiracy in their islands All at once the lands were removed and scattered in the fray. No land could stand before their arms from Hatti Qode Carchemish Arzawa and Alashiya on being cut off i.e. destroyed at one time. A camp was set up in Amurru. They desolated its people and its land was like that which has never come into being. They were coming forward toward Egypt while the flame was prepared before them. Their confederation was the Peleset Tjeker Shekelesh Denyen and Weshesh lands united. They laid their hands upon the land as far as the circuit of the earth their hearts confident and trusting Our plans will succeed48 The inscriptions of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu record three victorious campaigns against the Sea Peoples that are considered bona fide in Years 5 8 and 12 as well as three considered spurious against the Nubians and Libyans in Year 5 and the Libyans with Asiatics in Year 11. During Year 8 some Hittites were operating with the Sea Peoples.49 The inner west wall of the second court describes the invasion of Year 5. Only the Peleset and Tjeker are mentioned but the list is lost in a lacuna. The attack was twopronged one by sea and one by land. That is the Sea Peoples divided their forces. Ramesses was waiting in the Nile mouths and trapped the enemy fleet there. The land forces were defeated separately. The Sea Peoples did not learn any lessons from this defeat as they repeated their mistake in Year 8 with a similar result. The campaign is recorded more extensively on the inner northwest panel of the first court. It is possible but not generally believed that the dates are only those of the inscriptions and both refer to the same campaign. In Ramesses Year 8 the Nine Bows appear as a conspiracy in their isles. This time they are revealed unquestionably as Sea Peoples the Peleset Tjeker Shekelesh Denyen and Weshesh which are classified as foreign countries in the inscription. They camped in Amor and sent a fleet to the Nile. The pharaoh was once more waiting for them. He had built a fleet especially for the occasion hidden it in the mouths of the Nile and posted coast watchers. The enemy fleet was ambushed there their ships overturned and the men dragged up on shore and executed ad hoc. The land army was also routed within Egyptian controlled territory. Additional information is given in the relief on the outer side of the east wall. This land battle occurred in the vicinity of Djahy against the northern countries. When it was over several chiefs were captive of Hatti Amor and Shasu among the land peoples and the Tjeker Sherden of the sea Teresh of the sea and Peleset or Philistines. The campaign of Year 12 is attested by the Sdstele found on the south side of the temple. It mentions the Tjeker Peleset Denyen Weshesh and Shekelesh. Papyrus Harris I of the period found behind the temple suggests a wider campaign against the Sea Peoples but does not mention the date. In it the persona of Ramses III says I slew the Denyen Dynywn in their isles and burned the Tjeker and Peleset implying a maritime raid of his own. He also captured some Sherden and Weshesh of the sea and settled them in Egypt. As he is called the Ruler of Nine Bows in the relief of the east side these events probably happened in Year 8 i.e. the Pharaoh would have used the victorious fleet for some punitive expeditions elsewhere in the Mediterranean. The Rhetorical Stela to Ramesses III Chapel C Deir elMedina records a similar narrative.50 Onomasticon of Amenopeedit The Onomasticon of Amenope or Amenemipit amenemapt gives slight credence to the idea that the Ramesside kings settled the Sea Peoples in Canaan. Dated to about 1100 BC at the end of the 
22 nd dynasty this document simply lists names. After six place names four of which were in Philistia the scribe lists the Sherden Line 268 the Tjeker Line 269 and the Peleset Line 270 who might be presumed to occupy those cities.51 The Story of Wenamun on a papyrus of the same cache also places the Tjeker in Dor at that time. The fact that the Biblical maritime Tribe of Dan was initially located between the Philistines and the Tjekker has prompted some to suggest that they may have originally been Denyen. Sherden seem to have been settled around Megiddo and in the Jordan Valley and Weshwesh connected by some with the Biblical tribe of Asher may have been settled further north.citation needed Other documentary recordsedit Egyptian singlename sourcesedit Other Egyptian sources refer to one of the individual groups without reference to any of the other groups.22 The Amarna letters around the mid
14 th century BC including four relating to the Sea Peoples EA 151 refers to the Denyen in a passing reference to the death of their king EA 38 refers to the Lukka who are being accused of attacking the Egyptians in conjunction with the Alashiyans Cypriotes with the latter having stated that the Lukka were seizing their villages. EA 81 EA 122 and EA 123 refer to the Sherden. The letters at one point refer to a Sherden man as an apparent renegade mercenary52 and at another point to three Sherden who are slain by an Egyptian overseer.53 Padiisets Statue refers to the Peleset the Cairo Column54 refers to the Shekelesh the Story of Wenamun refers to the Tjekker and 13 further Egyptian sources refer to the Sherden.55 Byblosedit The Abishemu obelisk includes the words Kwkwn  Rwqq translated as Kukun son of Lukka The earliest ethnic group56 later considered among the Sea Peoples is believed to be attested in Egyptian hieroglyphs on the Abishemu obelisk found in the Temple of the Obelisks at Byblos by Maurice Dunand.5758 The inscription mentions kwkwn son of rwqq or kukun son of luqq transliterated as Kukunnis son of Lukka the Lycian.59 The date is given variously as 2000 or 1700 BC Ugaritedit Destructions at GibalaTell Tweini Harbour town GibalaTell Tweini Ugarit kingdom and the Sea People destruction layer.60 GibalaTell Tweini. Storage jars found in the Early Iron Age destruction layer.60 Some Sea Peoples appear in four of the Ugaritic texts the last three of which seem to foreshadow the destruction of the city around 1180 BC. The letters are therefore dated to the early 
12 th century. The last king of Ugarit was Ammurapi c. 11911182 BC who throughout this correspondence is quite a young man. RS 
34.1 29 the earliest letter found on the south side of the city from the Great King presumably Suppiluliuma II of the Hittites to the prefect of the city. He says that he ordered the king of Ugarit to send him Ibnadushu for questioning but the king was too immature to respond. He therefore wants the prefect to send the man whom he promises to return. What this language implies about the relationship of the Hittite empire to Ugarit is a matter of interpretation. Ibnadushu had been kidnapped by and had resided among a people of Shikala probably the Shekelesh who lived on ships. The letter is generally interpreted as an interest in military intelligence by the king.61 RS L 1 RS 
20.2 38 and RS 
20.1 8 are a set from the Rapanu Archive between a slightly older Ammurapi now handling his own affairs and Eshuwara the grand supervisor of Alasiya. Evidently Ammurapi had informed Eshuwara that an enemy fleet of 20 ships had been spotted at sea. Eshuwara wrote back and inquired about the location of Ammurapis own forces. Eshuwara also noted that he would like to know where the enemy fleet of 20 ships are now located.62 Unfortunately for both Ugarit and Alasiya neither kingdom was able to fend off the Sea Peoples onslaught and both were ultimately destroyed. A letter by Ammurapi RS 
18.1 47 to the king of Alasiyawhich was in fact a response to an appeal for assistance by the latterhas been found by archaeologists. In it Ammurapi describes the desperate plight facing Ugarit.a Ammurapi in turn appealed for aid from the viceroy of Carchemish which actually survived the Sea Peoples onslaught King KuziTeshub I who was the son of TalmiTeshuba direct contemporary of the last ruling Hittite king Suppiluliuma IIis attested in power there64 running a miniempire which stretched from Southeast Asia Minor North Syria ... to the west bend of the Euphrates65 from c. 1175 BC to 990 BC. Its viceroy could only offer some words of advice for Ammurapi.b Groupsedit The list of Sea People groups include some which are securely identified and others which are not. Lukkaedit Main article Lukka The Lukka people are known from numerous other Hittite and ancient Egyptian records. While the Lukka lands were located in the later region of Lycia Lukka people appear to have been highly mobile. The Lukka were never a unified kingdom instead having a decentralized political structure. The Lukka people were famously fractious with Hittite and Egyptian records describing them as raiders rebels and pirates. Lukka people fought against the Hittites as part of the Assuwa confederation later fought for the Hittites in the Battle of Kadesh.67686970 Karkiyaedit Main article Karkiya Karkiya was a region in western Anatolia known from references in Hittite and Egyptian records. Karkiya was governed by a council of chiefs rather than a king and was not a unified political entity. The Karkiyans had relations with the Hittite Empire but were never part of the empire proper. Relations with the Hittites had ups and downs and Karkiyan soldiers fought for the Hittites at the Battle of Kadesh most likely as mercenaries.7172 The name has been argued to be related to later terms for Caria though the linguistic connection is not certain.727374 Pelesetedit Main article Peleset Philistine Bichrome pottery The Peleset are generally regarded as originating somewhere within the Aegean cultural area.75 Historians generally identify the Peleset with the later Philistines.76 Evidence for this identification comes from the later Biblical tradition assosciating the Philistines with Caphtor. Aegeanstyle material remains such as Philistine Bichrome ware as well as genetic evidence suggesting that immigrants from Europe settled in sites such as Ashkalon at the beginning of the Iron Age.77 Both genetic and archaeological evidence suggests that any newcomers quickly acculturated and intermarried with local populations.78 Shekeleshedit Main article Shekelesh The Shekelesh appear in the earlier Great Karnak Inscription where they are described as auxiliary troops of the Libyan ruler Meryey. In the inscription the Pharaoh Merneptah claims that he killed between 200 and 222 of them.79 They may also appear in Hittite records as the seafaring Shikalayu Hittite  ikalaiauu though this connection is speculative.80 It has been hypothesized that the Shekelesh have some connection to Sicily though evidence is sparse and proposals vary as to whether Sicily was their original homeland or if they settled there after the Bronze Age.citation needed Sherdenedit Main article Sherden Bronze model of a nuraghe. 
10 th century BC The Sherden are previously mentioned in the records of Ramesses II who claimed to have defeated them in his second year 1278 BC when they attempted to raid Egypts coast. The pharaoh subsequently incorporated many of them into his personal guard.338182 They may also appear in the Amarna Letters with their name rendered in Akkadian as eertaannu.838485 Based on onomastic similarities similar weapons presence in the same places of the Mediterranean and similar relationships with other peoples there and other analysis of historical and archaeological sources some archaeologists have proposed to identify the Sherden with the Nuragic civilization of Sardinia.86878889 Potential further evidence for this position comes from 
12 th century Nuragic pottery found at Pyla Kokkinokremos a fortified settlement in Cyprus.90919293949596 Wesheshedit Main article Weshesh The Weshesh are the most sparsely attested among the Sea People. They are only found in documents pertaining to the reign of Ramesses III and no visual representation of them has ever been identified.979899 Ekwesh and Denyenedit Main articles Denyen and Ekwesh Warrior wearing a boars tusk helmet from a Mycenaean chamber tomb in the Acropolis of Athens

13 th century BC. The Ekwesh and the Denyen have been tentatively identified with the ethnonyms  and  which are attested in the Homeric epics.100 See alsoedit Hyksos Meryey Minoan civilization Tel Dor Thalassocracy Troy Notesedit  Quote My father behold the enemys ships came here my cities were burned and they did evil things in my country.

Maspero 1896 the somewhat misleading term Sea Peoples encompasses the ethnonyms Lukka Sherden Shekelesh Teresh Eqwesh Denyen Sikil  Tjekker Weshesh and Peleset Philistines. Footnote The modern term Sea Peoples refers to people that appear in several New Kingdom Egyptian texts as originating from islands tables 12 Adams and Cohen this volume see e.g. Drews 1993 57 for a summary. The use of quotation marks in association with the term Sea Peoples in our title is intended to draw attention to the problematic nature of this commonly used term. The designation of the sea appears only in relation to the Sherden Shekelesh and Eqwesh. Subsequently this term was applied somewhat indiscriminately to several additional ethnonyms including the Philistines who are portrayed in their earliest appearance as invaders from the north during the reigns of Merenptah and Ramesses Ill see e.g. Sandars 1978 Redford 1992 243 n. 14 for a recent review of the primary and secondary literature see Woudhuizen 2006. Henceforth the term Sea Peoples will appear without quotation marks.  a b c Drews 1995 pp. 4861 The thesis that a great migration of the Sea Peoples occurred ca. 1200 B.C. is supposedly based on Egyptian inscriptions one from the reign of Merneptah and another from the reign of Ramesses III. Yet in the inscriptions themselves such a migration nowhere appears. After reviewing what the Egyptian texts have to say about the sea peoples one Egyptologist Wolfgang Helck recently remarked that although some things are unclear eins ist aber sicher Nach den gyptischen Texten haben wir es nicht mit einer Vlkerwanderung zu tun One thing is however certain according to the Egyptian texts we are not dealing with a migration Thus the migration hypothesis is based not on the inscriptions themselves but on their interpretation.  Mller 1888 p. 147 In Egyptian history there is hardly any incident of so great an interest as the invasion of Egypt by the Mediterranean peoples the facts of which are connected with the most important questions of ethnography and the primitive history of classic nations.

Silberman 1998 p. 269.  a b de Roug 1855 p. 14 Translation from the French For a long time Kefa has been identified with verisimilitude with Caphthorim of the Bible to whom Gesenius along with most interpreters assigns as a residence the islands of Crete or Cyprus. The people of Cyprus had certainly to take sides in this war perhaps they were then the allies of Egypt. In any case our entry does not detail the names of these people from the islands of the Mediterranean. Champollion noted that Takkari which he names Fekkaros see appendix at the following entry and Schartana were recognizable in enemy ships with unique hairstyles. In addition in the crests of the conquered peoples the Schartana and the Touirasch bear the designation of the peoples of the sea. It is therefore likely that they belong to these nations from islands or coasts of the archipelago. The Rabou are still recognizable among the prisoners.  a b c Drews 1992 In fact this migration of the Sea Peoples is not to be found in Egyptian inscriptions but was launched by Gaston Maspero in 1873 footnote In the Revue Critique dHistoire et de Littrature 1873 pp. 8586. Although Masperos proposal initially seemed unlikely it gained credibility with the publication of the Lemnos stele. In 1895 in his popular Histoire ancienne des peuples de lorient classique footnote Vol. II Paris1895 translated into English as The Struggle of the Nations ed. A. H. Sayce tr. M. L. McClure New York 1896 Maspero fully elaborated his scenario of the migration of the Sea Peoples. Adopted by Eduard Meyer for the second edition of his Geschichted es Altertums the theory won general acceptance among Egyptologists and orientalists.  a b Silberman 1998 p. 272 As E. S. Sherratt has pointed out in an enlightening study of the interplay of ideology and literary strata in the formation of the Homeric epics 1990 phases of active narrative or descriptive invention closely correspond to periods of rapid social and political change. Sherratt notes that one of the characteristic manifestations of this process  in which emerging elites seek to legitimate their power  is the transformation of an existing oral epic tradition in order to dress it in more recognizably modern garb 1990 821. Can we not see in the history of the archaeology of the Sea Peoples a similar process of literary reformulation in which old components are reinterpreted and reassembled to tell a new tale Narrative presupposes that both storyteller and audience share a single perspective and therein may lie the connection between the intellectual and ideological dimensions of archaeology. To generalize beyond specific highly localized data archaeologists must utilize familiar conceptual frameworks and it is from the political and social ideologies of every generation that larger speculations about the historical role of the Sea Peoples have always been drawn. As many papers in this conference have suggested traditional interpretive structures are in the process of reconsideration and renovation. That is why I believe it essential that we reflect on our current Sea Peoples stories  and see if we cannot detect the subtle yet lingering impact upon them of some timeworn Victorian narratives.  a b c Vandersleyen 1985 p. 53 However of the nine peoples concerned by these wars only four were actually defined as coming from wdwr or from p ym. Furthermore these expressions seem to be linked more often to vegetation and sweet water than to seawater and it seems clear that the term Sea Peoples has to be abandoned. Some will object to this basing themselves on the expression iww hrywib w
3 dwr usually translated by islands situated in the middle of the sea where some of the Sea Peoples are said to have come from. Indeed. it is this expression that supported the persistent idea that the Sea Peoples came from the Aegean islands or at least from an East Mediterranean island. Now these terms are misleading not only because w
3 dwr and p3 ym quite likely do not designate the sea here but also because the term in itself does not always mean island it can also be used to indicate other kinds of territories not necessarily maritime ones. The argument based on these alleged sea islands is thus groundless ... To conclude the Philistines came neither from Crete nor from the Aegean islands or coasts but probably from the southern coast of Asia Minor or from Syria.  Yoo J. Zerbini A. Barron C. 2018. Migration and Migrant Identities in the Near East from Antiquity to the Middle Ages. Taylor  Francis. p. 2. ISBN 9781351254755. Retrieved 24 February 2024. The earliest scholarly thesis to deal with migration in the ancient Near East emerged in the work of Gaston Maspero his Histoire ancienne des peuples de lorient classique blamed a vast migration for the ruin of Bronze Age civilisation attributing its fall to a migrating confederation of Sea Peoples that attacked Egypt and other areas of Asia Minor. Although now widely considered a deeply problematic theory and one that has been largely dismissed it was not until the early 19
90 s that it received proper rigorous questioning in the scholarship of Claude Vandersleyen Robert Drews and Neil Silberman amongst others.

17 th letter of Champollion provide a complete and faithful summary of the campaigns of Ramses III his Ramses Ammon especially that represented on the north wall containing the famous basrelief of a naval battle where the enemy ships are driven to shore by the Egyptian fleet and simultaneously crushed by the army which the press on the other side. Champollion recognized that among the enemies of Ramesses there were a new people belonging to the white race and designated as the Tamhou. He copied the first line of the large inscription of the pylon with a date he specified in the ninth year of the reign and he noted the importance of this text which contains several names of people. ... After receiving this just tribute of praise the King finally begins his speech to the thirteenth line. It recommends to all his subjects to pay attention to his words and shows their feelings that must lead them in life then he boasts of his exploits he brings glory to his father the god Ammon who gave him all the conquests. After a column header which unfortunately suffered a lot is one of the most important parts of our text in which the king lists the enemies he has overcome beginning with the Cheta the Ati the Karkamasch the Aratou the Arasa then after a short break at their camp in the country of Amaour I destroyed the people and their country as if they had never existed We see that these different peoples common enemies of Egypt in their Asian campaigns before those of Ramses III are gathered in one group. In the next column we find a second group formed of people considered by Champollion to have played an important role in the campaign with the naval combat ships it is the Poursata the Takkara the Shakarsha the Taamou and Ouaschascha. We see that the only missing Sharetana to this list.

2 a.  A convenient table of Sea Peoples in hieroglyphics transliteration and English is given in Woudhuizen 2006 who developed it from works of Kitchen cited there  Oren 2000 p. 85 Thus far rather meager documentation is available. What I shall do for the remainder of this essay is to focus on what is in fact our primary source on the Sea Peoples the basis of virtually all significant discussions of them including many efforts to identify the Sea Peoples with archaeologically known cultures or groups in the Mediterranean and beyond. This source is the corpus of scenes and texts relevant to the Sea Peoples displayed on the walls of the mortuary temple of Ramesses III at western Thebes. Although it has been much discussed this corpus has often led scholars to different and contradictory conclusions and will always probably be subject to debate because of certain ambiguities inherent in the material.  a b Breasted 1906 Vol III 588  p.248 and 601  p.255 of the countries of the sea. Breasted wrote in a footnote regarding this designation It is noticeable that this designation both here and in the Athribis Stela 1. 13 is inserted only after the Ekwesh. In the Athribis Stela Ekwesh is cut off by a numeral from the preceding showing that the designation there belongs only to them.  a b c Gardiner 1947 p. 196 Vol. 1 in his commentary on the Onomasticon of Amenope No. 268 Srdn wrote The records of Meneptah are much more explicit the great Karnak inscription described how the Ekwesh Tursha Lukki Sherden and Sheklesh L.1 had been incited against Egypt by the prince of the Libu Libyans in L.52 the Sherden Sheklesh and Ekwesh are collectively described as var.  the foreign lands var. foreigners of the sea Note Gardiners reference to the alternative var. writing foreigners referred to Gustave Lefebvres Stle de lan V de Mneptah Archived 6 February 2017 at the Wayback Machine ASAE 27 1927 p.23 line 13 describing the Athribis Stele.

The articles in Wikipedia on related topics use one set of dates by convention but these and all dates based on them are not the only possible.

Also found in Breasted 1906 volume 4 p. 44 75  Oren 2000 p. 86 One consists of a string of large scale scenes complemented with relatively brief texts extending in a narrative sequence along part of the north facade of the temple which it shares with part of a similar narrative treatment of Ramesses IIIs Year 5 campaign against the Libyans. This latter sequence originates however on the west or rear wall of the temple. The other physically quite separate composition relating to the Sea Peoples is displayed across the external eastern face of the great pylon which separates the first court of the temple from the second. On the pylons southern wing is a largescale scene  occupying most of the facade  showing Ramesses III leading three lines of captive Sea Peoples to AmunRe lord of Thebes and of the empire and his consort Mut. Displayed on the equivalent space of the north wing is a long text without pictorial embellishment which is a verbal statement by Ramesses III describing at length his victory over the Sea Peoples and the extraordinary beneficence of AmunRe thus displayed to the entire land gathered together. In fact this apparent simplicity  two separate and somewhat different compositions relevant to the Sea Peoplesbelies the actual complexity of the compositional relationship between the two Sea Peoples compositions on the one hand and their joint relationship to the entire compositional scheme or program of the entire temple on the other. Any effort to understand the historical significance of the Sea Peoples records at Medinet Habu must take this compositional dimension into account as well as the conceptual dimensional the relationship of the general composition scheme or program to the functions and meanings of the temple as understood by the Egyptians.  Beckman cites the first few lines of the inscription located on the NW panel of the
