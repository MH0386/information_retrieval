26 th Dynasty or Dynasty 26 was the last native dynasty of ancient Egypt before the Persian conquest in 525 BC although other brief periods of rule by Egyptians followed. The dynastys reign 664525 BC is also called the Saite Period after the city of Sais where its pharaohs had their capital and marks the beginning of the Late Period of ancient Egypt.1 Historyedit This dynasty traced its origins to the Twentyfourth Dynasty. Psamtik I was probably a descendant of Bakenranef. However other sources describe him as of Libyan descent.23 Following the NeoAssyrian conquest of Egypt during the reigns of Taharqa and Tantamani and the subsequent collapse of the Napatabased Twentyfifth Dynasty of Egypt Psamtik I was recognized as sole king over all of Egypt. Psamtik formed alliances with King Gyges of Lydia who sent him mercenaries from Caria and ancient Greece that Psamtik used to unify all of Egypt under his rule. In 605 BCE an Egyptian force under Necho II of Dynasty XXVI fought the NeoBabylonian Empire at the Battle of Carchemish helped by the remnants of the military of the NeoAssyrian Empire but this was met with defeat. With the sack of Nineveh in 612 BC and the fall of the NeoAssyrian Empire both Psamtik and his successors attempted to reassert Egyptian power in the Near East but were driven back by the NeoBabylonian Empire under Nebuchadnezzar II. With the help of Greek mercenaries Pharaoh Apries was able to hold back Babylonian attempts to conquer Egypt. The Persians would eventually invade Egypt in 525 BCE when Emperor Cambyses II captured and later executed Psamtik III in the First Achaemenid conquest of Egypt. He founded the First Egyptian Satrapy a territory of the Achaemenid Empire was crowned the first pharaoh of the Dynasty XXVII. Archaeologyedit In May 2020 an EgyptianSpanish archaeological mission headed by Esther Ponce revealed a unique cemetery which consists of one room built with glazed limestone dating back to the 
26 th Dynasty also known as the ElSawi era at the site of ancient Oxyrhynchus. Archaeologists also uncovered bronze coins clay seals Roman tombstones and small crosses.456 On October 3 2020 Egypt unveiled 59 coffins of priests and clerks from the 
26 th dynasty dating to nearly 2500 years ago.7 Artedit Pottery vessel showing the face of god Bes from the

26 th Dynastyedit For a more comprehensive list see List of pharaohs. Psamtik I enters Ashdod in the Fall of Ashdod in 635 BCE. The 
26 th Dynasty may be related to the 
24 th Dynasty. Manetho begins the dynasty with Ammeris the Nubian 12 or 18 years Stephinates 7 years Nechepsos 6 years Necho 8 years. When the Nubian King Shabaka defeated Bakenranef son of Tefnakht he likely installed a Nubian commander as governor at Sais. This may be the man named Ammeris. Stephinates may be a descendant of Bakenrenef. He is sometimes referred to as Tefnakht II in the literature. Nechepsos has been identified with a local king named Nekauba 678672 BC. Manethos Necho is King Necho I 672664 BC Manetho gives his reign as 8 years.9 Necho was killed during a conflict with the Nubian king Tantamani. Psamtik I fled to Nineveh  capital of the NeoAssyrian Empire  and returned to Egypt when Ashurbanipal defeated Tantamani and drove him back south.1 Scholars now start the 
26 th Dynasty with the reign of Psamtik I.19 Sextus Julius Africanus states in his often accurate version of Manethos Epitome that the dynasty numbered 9 pharaohs beginning with a Stephinates Tefnakht II and ending with Psamtik III. Africanus also notes that Psamtik I and Necho I ruled for 54 and 8 years respectively.
