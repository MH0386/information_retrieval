The Nile is the longest river in Africa and has historically been considered the longest river in the world34 though this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.56 Of the worlds major rivers the Nile is one of the smallest as measured by annual flow in cubic metres of water.7 About 6650 km 4130 mia long its drainage basin covers eleven countries the Democratic Republic of the Congo Tanzania Burundi Rwanda Uganda Kenya Ethiopia Eritrea South Sudan Sudan and Egypt.9 In particular the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt Sudan and South Sudan.10 Additionally the Nile is an important economic river supporting agriculture and fishing. The Nile has two major tributaries the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream. However the Blue Nile is the source of most of the water of the Nile downstream containing 80 of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia11 and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.12 The northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Nubian Desert to Cairo and its large delta and the river flows into the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is with the Rhne and Po one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.13 Etymology This section may require copy editing for grammar style cohesion tone or spelling.

September 2023 Learn how and when to remove this message The standard English names White Nile and Blue Nile refer to the rivers source derived from Arabic names formerly applied to only the Sudanese stretches that meet at Khartoum.14 In the ancient Egyptian language the Nile is called py Hapy or Jtrw Iteru meaning river. In Coptic the word  pronounced piaro Sahidic or phiaro Bohairic means the river lit. ph.iaro the.canalgreat and comes from the same ancient name.15 In Nobiin the river is called man Daw meaning the great water.2 In Luganda the river is called Kiira or Kiyira. In Runyoro it is called Kihiira. In Egyptian Arabic the Nile is called enNl while in Standard Arabic it is called anNl. In Biblical Hebrew it is  HaYeor or  HaShior. The English name Nile and the Arabic names enNl and anNl both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek .1617 Beyond that however the etymology is disputed.1718 Homer called the river  Aiguptos but in subsequent periods Greek authors referred to its lower course as Neilos this term became generalised for the entire river system.19 Thus the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression n rwwt lit. the mouths of the front parts which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta and would have been pronounced nilohe in the area around Memphis in the 
8 th century BCE.19 Hesiod at his Theogony refers to Nilus  as one of the Potamoi river gods son of Oceanus and Tethys.20 Another derivation of Nile might be related to the term Nil Sanskrit  romanized nila Egyptian Arabic 15 which refers to Indigofera tinctoria one of the original sources of indigo dye.21 Another may be Nymphaea caerulea known as The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile which was found scattered over Tutankhamuns corpse when it was excavated in 19

2 citation needed Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term Nahal meaning river.23 Old Libyan has the term lilu meaning water in modern Berber ilel  means sea.24 Courses The Niles drainage basin25 With a total length of about 6650 km 4130 mia between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth. The drainage basin of the Nile covers 3254555 square kilometers 1256591 sq mi about 10 of the area of Africa.26 Compared to other major rivers though the Nile carries little water 5 of that of the Congo River for example.27 The Nile basin is complex and because of this the discharge at any given point along the main stem depends on many factors including weather diversions evaporation and evapotranspiration and groundwater flow. Upstream from Khartoum to the south the river is known as the White Nile a term also used in a limited sense to describe the section between Lake No and Khartoum. At Khartoum the river is joined by the Blue Nile. The White Nile starts in equatorial East Africa and the Blue Nile begins in Ethiopia. Both branches are on the western flanks of the East African Rift. Sources Source of the Nile redirects here. For other uses see Source of the Nile board game and Source of the Nile Bridge. Spring at Lake Victoria The source of the Blue Nile is Lake Tana28 in the Gish Abay region29 in the Ethiopian Highlands.3031 The source of the White Nile even after centuries of exploration remains in dispute. The most remote source that is indisputably a source for the White Nile is the Kagera River however the Kagera has tributaries that are in contention for the farthest source of the White Nile. Two start in Burundi the Ruvyironza River also known as the Luvironza and the Rurubu River.3231 In addition in 2010 an exploration party in Rwanda33 went to a place described as the source of the Rukarara tributary34 and by hacking a path up steep junglechoked mountain slopes in the Nyungwe Forest found in the dry season an appreciable incoming surface flow for many kilometres upstream and found a new source giving the Nile a length of 6758 km 4199 mi.citation needed In Uganda White Nile in Uganda The White Nile leaves Lake Victoria at Ripon Falls near Jinja Uganda as the Victoria Nile. It flows north for some 130 kilometers 81 mi to Lake Kyoga. The last part of the approximately 200 kilometers 120 mi river section starts from the western shores of the lake and flows at first to the west until just south of Masindi Port where the river turns north then makes a great half circle to the east and north to Karuma Falls. For the remaining part it flows westerly through the Murchison Falls until it reaches the northern shores of Lake Albert where it forms a significant river delta. Lake Albert is on the border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo but the Nile is not a border river at this point. After leaving Lake Albert the river continues north through Uganda and is known as the Albert Nile. In South Sudan The White Nile flows into South Sudan just south of Nimule where it is known as the Bahr al Jabal Mountain River35. Just south of the town is the confluence with the Achwa River. The Bahr al Ghazal 716 kilometers 445 mi long joins the Bahr al Jabal at a small lagoon called Lake No after which the Nile becomes known as the Bahr al Abyad or the White Nile from the whitish clay suspended in its waters. When the Nile floods it leaves a rich silty deposit which fertilizes the soil. The Nile no longer floods in Egypt since the completion of the Aswan Dam in 1970. An anabranch river the Bahr el Zeraf flows out of the Niles Bahr al Jabal section and rejoins the White Nile. The flow rate of the Bahr al Jabal at Mongalla is almost constant throughout the year and averages 1048 m
3 s 37000 cu fts. After Mongalla the Bahr Al Jabal enters the enormous swamps of the Sudd region. More than half of the Niles water is lost in this swamp to evaporation and transpiration. The average flow rate of the White Nile at the tails of the swamps is about 510 m
3 s 18000 cu fts. From here it meets with the Sobat River at Malakal. On an annual basis the White Nile upstream of Malakal contributes about 15 of the total outflow of the Nile.36 The average flow of the White Nile at Lake Kawaki Malakal just below the Sobat River is 924 m
3 s 32600 cu fts the peak flow is approximately 1218 m
3 s 43000 cu fts in October and minimum flow is about 609 m
3 s 21500 cu fts in April. This fluctuation is caused by the substantial variation in the flow of the Sobat which has a minimum flow of about 99 m
3 s 3500 cu fts in March and a peak flow of over 680 m
3 s 24000 cu fts in October.37 During the dry season January to June the White Nile contributes between 70 and 90 of the total discharge from the Nile. In Sudan Below Renk the White Nile enters Sudan it flows north to Khartoum and meets the Blue Nile. The course of the Nile in Sudan is distinctive. It flows over six groups of cataracts from the sixth at Sabaloka just north of Khartoum northward to Abu Hamad. The tectonic uplift of the Nubian Swell diverts the river southwest for over 300 km following the structure of the Central African Shear Zone embracing the Bayuda Desert. At Al Dabbah it resumes its northward course towards the first cataract at Aswan forming the Sshaped Great Bend of the Nile38 mentioned by Eratosthenes.39 In the north of Sudan the river enters Lake Nasser known in Sudan as Lake Nubia the larger part of which is in Egypt. In Egypt Below the Aswan Dam at the northern limit of Lake Nasser the Nile resumes its historic course. North of Cairo the Nile splits into two branches or distributaries that feed the Mediterranean the Rosetta Branch to the west and the Damietta to the east forming the Nile Delta. Sediment transport Nile Delta from space The annual sediment transport by the Nile in Egypt has been quantified.40 At Aswan

1.5  million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 13 of bedload Tributaries Red Nile Below the confluence with the Blue Nile the only major tributary is the Atbarah River also known as the Red Nile. Roughly halfway to the sea it originates in Ethiopia north of Lake Tana and is around 800 kilometers 500 mi long. The Atbarah flows only while there is rain in Ethiopia and dries very rapidly. During the dry period of January to June it typically dries up north of Khartoum. Blue Nile Main article Blue Nile The Blue Nile Falls fed by Lake Tana near the city of Bahir Dar Ethiopia Annotated view of the Nile and Red Sea with a dust storm41 The Blue Nile Amharic  bay4243 springs from Lake Tana in the Ethiopian Highlands. The Blue Nile flows about 1400 kilometres to Khartoum where the Blue Nile and White Nile join to form the Nile.44 Ninety percent of the water and ninetysix percent of the transported sediment carried by the Nile45 originates in Ethiopia with fiftynine percent of the water from the Blue Nile the rest being from the Tekez Atbarah Sobat and small tributaries. The erosion and transportation of silt only occurs during the Ethiopian rainy season when rainfall is especially high in the Ethiopian Highlands the rest of the year the great rivers draining Ethiopia into the Nile have a weaker flow. In harsh and arid seasons and droughts the Blue Nile dries out completely.46 The flow of the Blue Nile varies considerably over its yearly cycle and is the main contribution to the large natural variation of the Nile flow. During the dry season the natural discharge of the Blue Nile can be as low as 113 m
3 s 4000 cu fts although upstream dams regulate the flow of the river. During the wet season the peak flow of the Blue Nile often exceeds 5663 m
3 s 200000 cu fts in late August a difference of a factor of 50. Before the placement of dams on the river the yearly discharge varied by a factor of 15 at Aswan. Peak flows of over 8212 m
3 s 290000 cu fts occurred during late August and early September and minimum flows of about 552 m
3 s 19500 cu fts occurred during late April and early May. Bahr el Ghazal and Sobat River The Bahr al Ghazal and the Sobat River are the two most important tributaries of the White Nile in terms of discharge. The Bahr al Ghazals drainage basin is the largest of any of the Niles subbasins measuring 520000 square kilometers 200000 sq mi in size but it contributes a relatively small amount of water about 2 m
3 s 71 cu fts annually because tremendous volumes of water are lost in the Sudd wetlands. The Sobat River which joins the Nile a short distance below Lake No drains about half as much land 225000 km2 86900 sq mi but contributes 412 cubic meters per second 14500 cu fts annually to the Nile.47 When in flood the Sobat carries a large amount of sediment adding greatly to the White Niles color.48 Yellow Nile Map of Nile tributaries in modern Sudan showing the Yellow Nile The Nile represented in an ancient Roman mosaic found from the ruins of Pompeii. The Yellow Nile is a former tributary that connected the Ouadda highlands of eastern Chad to the Nile River Valley c.8000 to c.1000 BCE.49 Its remains are known as the Wadi Howar. The wadi passes through Gharb Darfur near the northern border with Chad and meets up with the Nile near the southern point of the Great Bend. History Further information Sahara  Climate history Reconstruction of the Oikoumene inhabited world an ancient map based on Herodotus description of the world circa 450 BC The Nile has been the lifeline of civilization in Egypt since the Stone Age with most of the population and all of the cities of Egypt developing along those parts of the Nile valley lying north of Aswan. However the Nile used to run much more westerly through what is now Wadi Hamim and Wadi al Maqar in Libya and flow into the Gulf of Sidra.50 As the sea level rose at the end of the most recent ice age the stream which is now the northern Nile captured the ancestral Nile near Asyut.51 This change in climate also led to the current extents of the Sahara desert around 3400 BCE.52 Khufu branch The Giza pyramid complex originally overlooked a branch of the Nile that no longer exists. This branch was highest during the African Humid Period.5354 Ancient Niles The existing Nile has five earlier phases i the Upper Miocenian Eonile of about 6 million years BP557 ii the Upper Pliocenian Paleonile commencing about 
3.3 2 million years BP and during the Pleistocene iii The Nile phases including the ProtoNile commencing about 600000 years BP iv PreNile56 v transitioning at about 400000 years BP to the NeoNile.5556 Flowing north from the Ethiopian Highlands satellite imagery was used to identify dry watercourses in the desert to the west of the Nile. A canyon now filled by surface drift represents the Eonile that flowed during 2
35.3  million years before present. The Eonile transported clastic sediments to the Mediterranean several natural gas fields have been discovered within these sediments. During the lateMiocene Messinian salinity crisis when the Mediterranean Sea was a closed basin and evaporated to the point of being empty or nearly so the Nile cut its course down to the new base level until it was several hundred metres below world ocean level at Aswan and 2400 m 7900 ft below Cairo.5758 This created a very long and deep canyon which was filled with sediment after the Mediterranean was recreated.59 At some point the sediments raised the riverbed sufficiently for the river to overflow westward into a depression to create Lake Moeris. Lake Tanganyika drained northwards into the Nile until the Virunga Volcanoes blocked its course in Rwanda. The Nile was much longer at that time with its furthest headwaters in northern Zambia. The currently existing Nile first flowed during the former parts of the Wrm glaciation period.7 Affad 23 is an archaeological site located in alluvial deposits formed by an ancient channel of the Nile in the Affad region of southern Dongola Reach Sudan.60 Integrated Nile There are two theories about the age of the integrated Nile. One is that the integrated drainage of the Nile is of young age and that the Nile basin was formerly broken into series of separate basins only the most northerly of which fed a river following the present course of the Nile in Egypt and Sudan. Rushdi Said postulates that Egypt supplied most of the waters of the Nile during the early part of its history.61 The other theory is that the drainage from Ethiopia via rivers equivalent to the Blue Nile the Atbara and the Takazze flowed to the Mediterranean via the Egyptian Nile since well back into Tertiary times.62 Salama suggests that during the Paleogene and Neogene Periods 66 million to 
2.5 88 million years ago a series of separate closed continental basins each occupied one of the major parts of the Sudanese Rift System Mellut rift White Nile rift Blue Nile rift Atbara rift and Sag El Naam rift.63 The Mellut Basin is nearly 12 kilometers 
7.5  mi deep at its central part. This rift is possibly still active with reported tectonic activity in its northern and southern boundaries. The Sudd swamp which forms the central part of the basin may still be subsiding. The White Nile Rift system although shallower than the Bahr el Arab rift is about 9 kilometers 
5.6  mi deep. Geophysical exploration of the Blue Nile Rift System estimated the depth of the sediments to be 59 kilometers 
3.1 
5.6  mi. These basins were not interconnected until their subsidence ceased and the rate of sediment deposition was enough to fill and connect them. The Egyptian Nile connected to the Sudanese Nile which captures the Ethiopian and Equatorial headwaters during the current stages of tectonic activity in the Eastern Central and Sudanese Rift systems.64 The connection of the different Niles occurred during cyclic wet periods. The Atbarah overflowed its closed basin during the wet periods that occurred about 100000 to 120000 years ago. The Blue Nile connected to the main Nile during the 7000080000 years B.P. wet period. The White Nile system in Bahr El Arab and White Nile Rifts remained a closed lake until the connection of the Victoria Nile to the main system some 12500 years ago during the African humid period. Role in the founding of Egyptian civilization See also Ancient Egyptian agriculture An aerial view of irrigation from the Nile River supporting agriculture in Luxor Egypt A felucca traversing the Nile near Aswan The Greek historian Herodotus wrote that Egypt was the gift of the Nile. An unending source of sustenance it played a crucial role in the development of Egyptian civilization. Because the river overflowed its banks annually and deposited new layers of silt the surrounding land was very fertile. The Ancient Egyptians cultivated and traded wheat flax papyrus and other crops around the Nile. Wheat was a crucial crop in the famineplagued Middle East. This trading system secured Egypts diplomatic relationships with other countries and contributed to economic stability. Farreaching trade has been carried on along the Nile since ancient times.citation needed A tune Hymn to the Nile was created and sung by the ancient Egyptian peoples about the flooding of the Nile River and all of the miracles it brought to Ancient Egyptian civilization.65 Water buffalo were introduced from Asia and the Assyrians introduced camels in the 
7 th century BCE. These animals were raised for meat and were domesticated and used for ploughingor in the camels case carriage. Water was vital to both people and livestock. The Nile was also a convenient and efficient means of transportation for people and goods. The Nile was also an important part of ancient Egyptian spiritual life. Hapi was the god of the annual floods and both he and the pharaoh were thought to control the flooding. The Nile was considered to be a causeway from life to death and the afterlife. The east was thought of as a place of birth and growth and the west was considered the place of death as the god Ra the Sun underwent birth death and resurrection each day as he crossed the sky. Thus all tombs were west of the Nile because the Egyptians believed that in order to enter the afterlife they had to be buried on the side that symbolized death.citation needed As the Nile was such an important factor in Egyptian life the ancient calendar was even based on the three cycles of the Nile. These seasons each consisting of four months of thirty days each were called Akhet Peret and Shemu. Akhet which means inundation was the time of the year when the Nile flooded leaving several layers of fertile soil behind aiding in agricultural growth.66 Peret was the growing season and Shemu the last season was the harvest season when there were no rains.66 European search for the source John Hanning Speke c.1863. Speke was the Victorian explorer who first reached Lake Victoria in 1858 returning to establish it as the source of the Nile by 18
62.6 7 Owing to their failure to penetrate the Sudd wetlands of South Sudan the upper reaches of the White Nile remained largely unknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans. Vitruvius thought that source of the Nile was in Mauritania on the other south side of the Atlas Mountains.68 Various expeditions failed to determine the rivers source. Agatharchides records that in the time of Ptolemy II Philadelphus a military expedition had penetrated far enough along the course of the Blue Nile to determine that the summer floods were caused by heavy seasonal rainstorms in the Ethiopian Highlands but no European of antiquity is known to have reached Lake Tana. The Tabula Rogeriana depicted the source as three lakes in 1154. Europeans began to learn about the origins of the Nile in the 
14 th century when the Pope sent monks as emissaries to Mongolia who passed India the Middle East and Africa and described being told of the source of the Nile in Abyssinia Ethiopia.69 Later in the 
15 th and 
16 th centuries travelers to Ethiopia visited Lake Tana and the source of the Blue Nile in the mountains south of the lake. Supposedly Paolo Trevisani circa 14521483 a Venetian traveller in Ethiopia wrote a journal of his travels to the origin of the Nile that has since been lost.7071 Although James Bruce claimed to be the first European to have visited the headwaters72 modern writers give the credit to the Jesuit Pedro Pez. Pezs account of the source of the Nile73 is a long and vivid account of Ethiopia. It was published in full only in the early 
20 th century although it was featured in works of Pezs contemporaries including Baltazar Tllez74 Athanasius Kircher75 and Johann Michael Vansleb.76 Europeans had been resident in Ethiopia since the late 
15 th century and one of them may have visited the headwaters even earlier without leaving a written trace. The Portuguese Joo Bermudes published the first description of the Tis Issat Falls in his 1565 memoirs compared them to the Nile Falls alluded to in Ciceros De Republica.77 Jernimo Lobo describes the source of the Blue Nile visiting shortly after Pedro Pez. Telles also uses his account. The White Nile was even less understood. The ancients mistakenly believed that the Niger River represented the upper reaches of the White Nile. For example Pliny the Elder writes that the Nile had its origins in a mountain of lower Mauretania flowed above ground for many days distance then went underground reappeared as a large lake in the territories of the Masaesyli then sank again below the desert to flow underground for a distance of 20 days journey till it reaches the nearest Ethiopians.78 A map of the Nile c.1911 a time when its entire primary course ran through British occupations condominiums colonies and protectorates17 Modern exploration of the Nile basin began with the conquest of the northern and central Sudan by the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt Muhammad Ali and his sons from 1821 onward. As a result of this the Blue Nile was known as far as its exit from the Ethiopian foothills and the White Nile as far as the mouth of the Sobat River. Three expeditions under a Turkish officer Selim Bimbashi were made between 1839 and 1842 and two got to the point about 30 kilometres 20 miles beyond the present port of Juba where the country rises and rapids make navigation very difficult. Lake Victoria was first sighted by Europeans in 1858 when British explorer John Hanning Speke reached its southern shore while traveling with Richard Francis Burton to explore central Africa and locate the great lakes. Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this vast expanse of open water for the first time Speke named the lake after Queen Victoria. Burton recovering from illness and resting further south on the shores of Lake Tanganyika was outraged that Speke claimed to have proven his discovery to be the true source of the Nile when Burton regarded this as still unsettled. A quarrel ensued which sparked intense debate within the scientific community and interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Spekes discovery. British explorer and missionary David Livingstone pushed too far west and entered the Congo River system instead. It was ultimately WelshAmerican explorer Henry Morton Stanley who confirmed Spekes discovery circumnavigating Lake Victoria and reporting the great outflow at Ripon Falls on the lakes northern shore. Since 1950 The confluence of the Kagera and Ruvubu rivers near Rusumo Falls part of the Niles upper reaches Dhows on the Nile The Nile passes through Cairo Egypts capital city. The Nile has long been used to transport goods along its length. Winter winds blow south up river so ships could sail up river using sails and down river using the flow of the river. While most Egyptians still live in the Nile valley the 1970 completion of the Aswan Dam ended the summer floods and their renewal of the fertile soil fundamentally changing farming practices. The Nile supports much of the population living along its banks enabling Egyptians to live in otherwise inhospitable regions of the Sahara. The rivers flow is disturbed at several points by the Cataracts of the Nile which form an obstacle to navigation by boats. The Sudd also forms a formidable navigation obstacle and impedes water flow to the extent that Sudan had once attempted to build the Jonglei Canal to bypass the swamp.7980 Nile cities include Khartoum Aswan Luxor Thebes and the Giza  Cairo conurbation. The first cataract the closest to the mouth of the river is at Aswan north of the Aswan Dam. This part of the river is a regular tourist route with cruise ships and traditional wooden sailing boats known as feluccas. Many cruise ships ply the route between Luxor and Aswan stopping at Edfu and Kom Ombo along the way. Security concerns have limited cruising on the northernmost portion for many years. A computer simulation study to plan the economic development of the Nile was directed by H.A.W. Morrice and W.N. Allan for the Ministry of Hydropower of Sudan during 195557818283 Morrice was their hydrological adviser and Allan his predecessor. The calculations were enabled by accurate monthly inflow data collected for 50 years. The underlying principle was the use of overyear storage to conserve water from rainy years for use in dry years. Irrigation navigation and other needs were considered. Each computer run postulated a set of reservoirs and operating equations for the release of water as a function of the month and the levels upstream. The behavior that would have resulted given the inflow data was modeled. Over 600 models were run. Recommendations were made to the Sudanese authorities. The calculations were run on an IBM 650 computer. Simulation studies to design water resources are discussed further in the article on hydrology transport models which have been used since the 19
80 s to analyze water quality. Despite the development of many reservoirs drought during the 19
80 s led to widespread starvation in Ethiopia and Sudan but Egypt was nourished by water impounded in Lake Nasser. Drought has proven to be a major cause of fatality in the Nile river basin. According to a report by the Strategic Foresight Group around 170 million people have been affected by droughts in the last century with half a million lives lost.84 From the 70 incidents of drought which took place between 1900 and 2012 55 incidents took place in Ethiopia Sudan South Sudan Kenya and Tanzania.84 Water sharing dispute Hydropower dams in the Nile plus huge dam under construction in Ethiopia The Niles water has affected the politics of East Africa and the Horn of Africa for many decades. The dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the 
4.5  billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam has become a national preoccupation in both countries stoking patriotism deepseated fears and even murmurs of war.85 Countries including Uganda Sudan Ethiopia and Kenya have complained about Egyptian domination of its water resources. The Nile Basin Initiative promotes a peaceful cooperation among those states.8687 Several attempts have been made to establish agreements between the countries sharing the Nile waters. On 14 May 2010 at Entebbe Uganda Ethiopia Rwanda and Tanzania signed a new agreement on sharing the Nile water even though this agreement raised strong opposition from Egypt and Sudan. Ideally such international agreements should promote equitable and efficient usage of the Nile basins water resources. Without a better understanding about the availability of the future water resources of the Nile it is possible that conflicts could arise between these countries relying on the Nile for their water supply economic and social developments.10 Modern achievements and exploration White Nile In 1951 American John Goddard together with two French explorers became the first to successfully navigate the entire Nile from its source in Burundi at the potential headsprings of the Kagera River in Burundi to its mouth on the Mediterranean Sea a journey of approximately 6800 km 4200 mi. Their 
9 month journey is described in the book Kayaks down the Nile.88 The White Nile Expedition led by South African national Hendrik Coetzee navigated the White Niles entire length of approximately 3700 kilometres 2300 mi. The expedition began at the White Niles beginning at Lake Victoria in Uganda on 17 January 2004 and arrived at the Mediterranean in Rosetta four and a half months later.89 Blue Nile The Blue Nile Expedition led by geologist Pasquale Scaturro and his partner kayaker and documentary filmmaker Gordon Brown became the first known people to descend the entire Blue Nile from Lake Tana in Ethiopia to the beaches of Alexandria on the Mediterranean. Their approximately 52
30 kilometre 3250 mi journey took 114 days from 25 December 2003 to 28 April 2004. Though their expedition included others Brown and Scaturro were the only ones to complete the entire journey.90 Although they descended whitewater manually the team used outboard motors for much of their journey. On 29 January 2005 Canadian Les Jickling and New Zealander Mark Tanner completed the first humanpowered transit of Ethiopias Blue Nile. Their journey of over 5000 kilometres 3100 mi took five months. They recount that they paddled through two war zones regions notorious for bandits and were arrested at gunpoint.91 Crossings Crossings from Khartoum to the Mediterranean Sea clarification needed View of the Qasr El Nil Bridge in Cairo with Gezira Island in the background El Mek Nimr Bridge in Khartoum The following bridges cross the Blue Nile and connect Khartoum to Khartoum North Mac Nimir Bridge9293 Blue Nile Road  Railway Bridge Burri Bridgecitation needed Elmansheya Bridge94 Soba Bridge The following bridges cross the White Nile and connect Khartoum to Omdurman White Nile Bridge Victory Bridge also known as El Fitihab Bridge The following bridges cross from Omdurman to Khartoum North Hafaya Bridge The following bridges cross to Tuti from Khartoum states three cities Tuti Bridge9395 previously known as the Khartoum NorthTuti bridge 92 Other bridges Shandi Bridge Shendi Atbarah Bridge Atbarah Merowe Dam Merowe Merowe Bridge Merowe Aswan Bridge Aswan Luxor Bridge Luxor Suhag Bridge Suhag Assiut Bridge Assiut Al Minya Bridge Minya Al Marazeek Bridge Helwan First Ring Road Bridge Moneeb Crossing Cairo Abbas Bridge Cairo University Bridge Cairo Qasr alNil Bridge Cairo
