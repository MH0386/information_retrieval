Historically the Nile River split into seven branches of the delta in Lower Egypt. Lower Egypt was divided into nomes and began to advance as a civilization after 3600 BC.1 Today it contains two major channels that flow through the delta of the Nile River  Mahmoudiyah Canal ancient Agathos Daimon and Muways Canal Arabic   waterway of Moses. Nameedit In Ancient Egyptian Lower Egypt was known as mw which means north.2 Later on during Antiquity and the Middle Ages Greeks and Romans called it   or Aegyptus Inferior both meaning Lower Egypt but Copts carried on using the old name related to the north  Tsakhet Coptic  or Psanemhit Coptic  meaning the Northern part. It was further divided into a number of regions or nomes Coptic  romanized ptosh  Niphaiat Coptic  lit.Libyan nome Ancient Greek  in the west Tiarabia Coptic  lit.Arabia in the east Nimeshshoti Coptic  lit.fields in the northeast and Bashmur Bashmuric Coptic  lit.sand shore in the north. Champollion adds another region in the middle of the Delta which he calls Petmour Coptic  lit.the one which bounds girds3 based on Ancient Greek  mentioned by Stephanus of Byzantium but it is unclear if this is a separate region or just a Greek rendering of the name Bashmur.4 After the Muslim conquest the middle part of the Delta was called alRif Arabic  which means countryside rural area and which is derived from Ancient Egyptian rpr temple because the rural areas were administered by them.5 The eastern part roughly comprising the ancient Tiarabia was called alHawf Arabic  meaning edge fringe.6 Geographyedit Today there are two principal channels that the Nile takes through the river delta one in the west at Rashid and one in the east at Damietta. The delta region is well watered crisscrossed by channels and canals. Owing primarily to its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea the climate in Lower Egypt is milder than that of Upper Egypt the southern portion of the country. Temperatures are less extreme and rainfall is more abundant in Lower Egypt. Historyedit It was divided into twenty districts called nomes the first of which was at elLisht. Because Lower Egypt was mostly undeveloped scrubland filled with all types of plant life such as grasses and herbs the organization of the nomes underwent several changes. The capital of Lower Egypt was Memphis. Its patron goddess was the goddess Wadjet depicted as a cobra. Lower Egypt was represented by the Red Crown Deshret and its symbols were the papyrus and the bee. After unification the patron deities of both Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt were represented together as the Two Ladies Wadjet and Nekhbet depicted as a vulture to protect all of the ancient Egyptians. By approximately 3600 BC Neolithic Egyptian societies along the Nile River had based their culture on the raising of crops and the domestication of animals.7 Shortly after 3600 BC Egyptian society began to grow and advance rapidly toward refined civilization.1 A new and distinctive pottery which was related to the pottery in the Southern Levant appeared during this time. Extensive use of copper became common during this time.1 The Mesopotamian process of sundried bricks and architectural building principlesincluding the use of the arch and recessed walls for decorative effectbecame popular during this time.1 Concurrent with these cultural advances a process of unification of the societies and towns of the upper Nile River or Upper Egypt occurred. At the same time the societies of the Nile Delta or Lower Egypt also underwent a unification process.1 Warfare between Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt occurred often.1 During his reign in Upper Egypt King Narmer defeated his enemies in the Delta and merged the kingdoms of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt under his single rule.8 List of kings of the Predynastic Period of Lower Egyptedit The Palermo stone a royal annal written in the mid Fifth Dynasty c. 2490 BC  c. 2350 BC records a number of kings reigning over Lower Egypt before Narmer.
