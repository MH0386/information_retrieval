Over the course of its history Egypt has had many capitals. Its earliest capital was Tjenu better known as Thinis which may have been the capital of the hypothetical Thinite Confederacy prior to Egypts unification. During the First Second and Third Intermediate Periods Egypt had multiple capitals held by rival dynasties. Thinis was Egypts first capital following its unification in c. 3100 BCE. The countrys current capital is Cairo and this has been the case since 972. This makes Cairo Egypts longestrunning capital city having retained this status for over 1050 years under the rule of six dynasties followed by the British protectorate of Egypt and the Republic of Egypt. Alexandria was the second longestlasting capital of Egypt being used for the entirety of the GrecoRoman period which lasted for 973 years. Memphis was the capital of Egypt for over 700 years and was the seat of the power for the whole of the Old Kingdom period. Thebes was used as the capital for approximately 485 years mostly during the Middle and New Kingdoms. List of Egyptian capitalsedit Name Time Period Ruling Dynasties Ref.
