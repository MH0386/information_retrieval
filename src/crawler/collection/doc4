30 th parallel N. It thus consists of the entire Nile River valley from Cairo south to Lake Nasser formed by the Aswan High Dam.2 Nameedit In ancient Egypt Upper Egypt was known as t mw3 literally the Land of Reeds or the Sedgeland named for the sedges that grow there.4 In Arabic the region is called Said or Sahid from  meaning uplands from the root  meaning to go up ascend or rise. Inhabitants of Upper Egypt are known as Saidis and they generally speak Saiidi Egyptian Arabic. Geographyedit Map of Ancient Egypt with its historical nomes. Upper Egypt is in the lower portion of the map. Upper Egypt is between the Cataracts of the Nile beyond modernday Aswan downriver northward to the area of ElAyait5 which places modernday Cairo in Lower Egypt. The northern downriver part of Upper Egypt between Sohag and ElAyait is also known as Middle Egypt. Historyedit It is believed to have been united by the rulers of the supposed Thinite Confederacy who absorbed their rival city states during the Naqada III period c. 32003000 BC and its subsequent unification with Lower Egypt ushered in the Early Dynastic period.6 Upper and Lower Egypt became intertwined in the symbolism of pharaonic sovereignty such as the Pschent double crown.7 Upper Egypt remained as a historical region even after the classical period. Predynastic Egyptedit The main city of prehistoric Upper Egypt was Nekhen.8 The patron deity was the goddess Nekhbet depicted as a vulture.9 By approximately 3600 BC Neolithic Egyptian societies along the Nile based their culture on the raising of crops and the domestication of animals.10 Shortly thereafter Egypt began to grow and increase in complexity.11 A new and distinctive pottery appeared related to the Levantine ceramics and copper implements and ornaments became common.11 Mesopotamian building techniques became popular using sundried adobe bricks in arches and decorative recessed walls.11 In Upper Egypt the predynastic Badari culture was followed by the Naqada culture Amratian12 closely related to the Lower Nubian13141516 other northeast African populations17 and some tropical African groups.1819 Also the protodynastic kings emerged from the Naqada region.20 Excavations at Hierakonpolis Upper Egypt found archaeological evidence of ritual masks similar to those used further south of Egypt and obsidian linked to Ethiopian quarry sites.21 Frank Yurco stated that depictions of pharonic iconography such as the royal crowns Horus falcons and victory scenes were concentrated in the Upper Egyptian Naqada culture and AGroup Lower Nubia. He further elaborated that Egyptian writing arose in Naqadan Upper Egypt and AGroup Lower Nubia and not in the Delta cultures where the direct Western Asian contact was made further vititates the Mesopotamianinfluence argument.22 Similarly Christopher Ehret historian and linguist stated that the cultural practice of sacral chiefship and kingship which emerged in Upper Egypt in the fourth millennium had originated centuries earlier in Nubia and the Middle Nile south of Egypt. He based this judgement on supporting archaeological and comparative ethnographic evidence.23 According to bioarchaeologist Nancy Lovell the morphology of ancient Egyptian skeletons gives strong evidence that In general the inhabitants of Upper Egypt and Nubia had the greatest biological affinity to people of the Sahara and more southerly areas but exhibited local variation in an African context.24 S. O. Y. Keita a biological anthropologist also reviewed studies on the biological affinities of the Ancient Egyptian population and characterised the skeletal morphologies of predynastic southern Egyptians as a Saharotropical African variant. Keita had also added that whilst Egyptian society became more socially complex and biologically varied the ethnicity of the NilotoSaharoSudanese origins did not change.25 These cultural advances paralleled the political unification of towns of the upper Nile River or Upper Egypt while the same occurred in the societies of the Nile Delta or Lower Egypt.11 This led to warfare between the two new kingdoms.11 During his reign in Upper Egypt King Narmer defeated his enemies on the delta and became sole ruler of the two lands of Upper and Lower Egypt26 a sovereignty which endured throughout Dynastic Egypt. Dynastic Egyptedit In royal symbolism Upper Egypt was represented by the tall White Crown Hedjet the flowering lotus and the sedge. Its patron deity Nekhbet was depicted by the vulture. After unification the patron deities of Upper and Lower Egypt were represented together as the Two Ladies to protect all of the ancient Egyptians just as the two crowns were combined into a single pharaonic diadem. Several dynasties of southern or Upper Egyptian origin which included the

25 th dynasties reunified and reinvigorated pharaonic Egypt after periods of fragmentation.27 For most of Egypts ancient history Thebes was the administrative center of Upper Egypt. After its devastation by the Assyrians the importance of Egypt declined. Under the dynasty of the Ptolemies Ptolemais Hermiou took over the role of the capital city of Upper Egypt.28 A 2005 study on Theban nobles had found that the mummified remains had a histology which indicated notably dark skin.29 Medieval Egyptedit In the eleventh century large numbers of pastoralists known as Hilalians fled Upper Egypt and moved westward into Libya and as far as Tunis.30 It is believed that degraded grazing conditions in Upper Egypt associated with the beginning of the Medieval Warm Period were the root cause of the migration.31 
20 thcentury Egyptedit In the twentiethcentury Egypt the title Prince of the Said meaning Prince of Upper Egypt was used by the heir apparent to the Egyptian throne.Note 1 Although the Kingdom of Egypt was abolished after the Egyptian revolution of 1952 the title continues to be used by Muhammad Ali Prince of the Said.

There is now a sufficient body of evidence from modern studies of skeletal remains to indicate that the ancient Egyptians especially southern Egyptians exhibited physical characteristics that are within the range of variation for ancient and modern indigenous peoples of the Sahara and tropical Africa. The distribution of population characteristics seems to follow a clinal pattern from south to north which may be explained by natural selection as well as gene flow between neighboring populations.
