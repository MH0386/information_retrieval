Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator Koin Greek   note 5 lit. Cleopatra fatherloving goddessnote 6 7069 BC  10 August 30 BC was Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 51 to 30 BC and its last active ruler.note 7 A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty she was a descendant of its founder Ptolemy I Soter a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great.note 8 After the death of Cleopatra Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire marking the end of the last Hellenisticperiod state in the Mediterranean and of the age that had lasted since the reign of Alexander 336323 BC.note 9 Her first language was Koine Greek and she was the only known Ptolemaic ruler to learn the Egyptian language.note 
10 In 58 BC Cleopatra presumably accompanied her father Ptolemy XII Auletes during his exile to Rome after a revolt in Egypt a Roman client state allowed his rival daughter Berenice IV to claim his throne. Berenice was killed in 55 BC when Ptolemy returned to Egypt with Roman military assistance. When he died in 51 BC the joint reign of Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIII began but a fallingout between them led to an open civil war. After losing the 48 BC Battle of Pharsalus in Greece against his rival Julius Caesar a Roman dictator and consul in Caesars civil war the Roman statesman Pompey fled to Egypt. Pompey had been a political ally of Ptolemy XII but Ptolemy XIII at the urging of his court eunuchs had Pompey ambushed and killed before Caesar arrived and occupied Alexandria. Caesar then attempted to reconcile the rival Ptolemaic siblings but Ptolemys chief adviser Potheinos viewed Caesars terms as favoring Cleopatra so his forces besieged her and Caesar at the palace. Shortly after the siege was lifted by reinforcements Ptolemy XIII died in the Battle of the Nile Cleopatras halfsister Arsinoe IV was eventually exiled to Ephesus for her role in carrying out the siege. Caesar declared Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIV joint rulers but maintained a private affair with Cleopatra that produced a son Caesarion. Cleopatra traveled to Rome as a client queen in 46 and 44 BC where she stayed at Caesars villa. After Caesars assassination followed shortly afterwards by that of Ptolemy XIV on Cleopatras orders she named Caesarion coruler as Ptolemy XV.In the Liberators civil war of 4342 BC Cleopatra sided with the Roman Second Triumvirate formed by Caesars grandnephew and heir Octavian Mark Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. After their meeting at Tarsos in 41 BC the queen had an affair with Antony which produced three children. He carried out the execution of Arsinoe at her request and became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding and military aid during his invasions of the Parthian Empire and the Kingdom of Armenia. The Donations of Alexandria declared their children rulers over various erstwhile territories under Antonys triumviral authority. This event their marriage and Antonys divorce of Octavians sister Octavia Minor led to the final war of the Roman Republic. Octavian engaged in a war of propaganda forced Antonys allies in the Roman Senate to flee Rome in 32 BC and declared war on Cleopatra. After defeating Antony and Cleopatras naval fleet at the 31 BC Battle of Actium Octavians forces invaded Egypt in 30 BC and defeated Antony leading to Antonys suicide. When Cleopatra learned that Octavian planned to bring her to his Roman triumphal procession she killed herself by poisoning contrary to the popular belief that she was bitten by an asp.Cleopatras legacy survives in ancient and modern works of art. Roman historiography and Latin poetry produced a generally critical view of the queen that pervaded later Medieval and Renaissance literature. In the visual arts her ancient depictions include Roman busts paintings and sculptures cameo carvings and glass Ptolemaic and Roman coinage and reliefs. In Renaissance and Baroque art she was the subject of many works including operas paintings poetry sculptures and theatrical dramas. She has become a pop culture icon of Egyptomania since the Victorian era and in modern times Cleopatra has appeared in the applied and fine arts burlesque satire Hollywood films and brand images for commercial products.The Latinized form Cleopatra comes from the Ancient Greek Kleoptra  meaning glory of her father5 from  klos glory and  patr father.6 The masculine form would have been written either as Klepatros  or Ptroklos .6 Cleopatra was the name of Alexander the Greats sister Cleopatra of Macedonia as well as the wife of Meleager in Greek mythology Cleopatra Alcyone.7 Through the marriage of Ptolemy V Epiphanes and Cleopatra I Syra a Seleucid princess the name entered the Ptolemaic dynasty.89 Cleopatras adopted title The Philoptra   means goddess who loves her father.10
11 note 
11 Ptolemaic pharaohs were crowned by the Egyptian high priest of Ptah at Memphis but resided in the multicultural and largely Greek city of Alexandria established by Alexander the Great.1314
15 note 12 They spoke Greek and governed Egypt as Hellenistic Greek monarchs refusing to learn the native Egyptian language.1617
18 note 10 In contrast Cleopatra could speak multiple languages by adulthood and was the first Ptolemaic ruler known to learn the Egyptian language.1920
18 note 13 Plutarch implies that she also spoke Ethiopian the language of the Troglodytes Hebrew or Aramaic Arabic the Syrian language perhaps Syriac Median and Parthian and she could apparently also speak Latin although her Roman contemporaries would have preferred to speak with her in her native Koine Greek.2018
21 note 14 Aside from Greek Egyptian and Latin these languages reflected Cleopatras desire to restore North African and West Asian territories that once belonged to the Ptolemaic Kingdom.
22 Roman interventionism in Egypt predated the reign of Cleopatra.232425 When Ptolemy IX Lathyros died in late 81 BC he was succeeded by his daughter Berenice III.2627 With opposition building at the royal court against the idea of a sole reigning female monarch Berenice III accepted joint rule and marriage with her cousin and stepson Ptolemy XI Alexander II an arrangement made by the Roman dictator Sulla.2627 Ptolemy XI had his wife killed shortly after their marriage in 80 BC and was lynched soon after in the resulting riot over the assassination.262829 Ptolemy XI and perhaps his uncle Ptolemy IX or father Ptolemy X Alexander I willed the Ptolemaic Kingdom to Rome as collateral for loans so that the Romans had legal grounds to take over Egypt their client state after the assassination of Ptolemy XI.263031 The Romans chose instead to divide the Ptolemaic realm among the illegitimate sons of Ptolemy IX bestowing Cyprus on Ptolemy of Cyprus and Egypt on Ptolemy XII Auletes.26
28 Cleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to the ruling Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy XII and an uncertain mother32
33 note 15 presumably Ptolemy XIIs wife Cleopatra V Tryphaena who may have been the same person as Cleopatra VI Tryphaena3435
36 note 
16 note 3 the mother of Cleopatras older sister Berenice IV Epiphaneia.3738
39 note 17 Cleopatra Tryphaena disappears from official records a few months after the birth of Cleopatra in 69 BC.4041 The three younger children of Ptolemy XII Cleopatras sister Arsinoe IV and brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV373839 were born in the absence of his wife.4243 Cleopatras childhood tutor was Philostratos from whom she learned the Greek arts of oration and philosophy.44 During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the Musaeum including the Library of Alexandria.45
46 In 65 BC the Roman censor Marcus Licinius Crassus argued before the Roman Senate that Rome should annex Ptolemaic Egypt but his proposed bill and the similar bill of tribune Servilius Rullus in 63 BC were rejected.4950 Ptolemy XII responded to the threat of possible annexation by offering remuneration and lavish gifts to powerful Roman statesmen such as Pompey during his campaign against Mithridates VI of Pontus and eventually Julius Caesar after he became Roman consul in 59 BC.5152
53 note 19 However Ptolemy XIIs profligate behavior bankrupted him and he was forced to acquire loans from the Roman banker Gaius Rabirius Postumus.5455
56 In 58 BC the Romans annexed Cyprus and on accusations of piracy drove Ptolemy of Cyprus Ptolemy XIIs brother to commit suicide instead of enduring exile to Paphos.5758
56 note 20 Ptolemy XII remained publicly silent on the death of his brother a decision which along with ceding traditional Ptolemaic territory to the Romans damaged his credibility among subjects already enraged by his economic policies.575960 Ptolemy XII was then exiled from Egypt by force traveling first to Rhodes then Athens and finally the villa of triumvir Pompey in the Alban Hills near Praeneste Italy.5758
61 note 
21 Ptolemy XII spent nearly a year there on the outskirts of Rome ostensibly accompanied by his daughter Cleopatra then about 
11.5 7
61 note 22 Berenice IV sent an embassy to Rome to advocate for her rule and oppose the reinstatement of her father Ptolemy XII. Ptolemy had assassins kill the leaders of the embassy an incident that was covered up by his powerful Roman supporters.6255
63 note 23 When the Roman Senate denied Ptolemy XII the offer of an armed escort and provisions for a return to Egypt he decided to leave Rome in late 57 BC and reside at the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus.6465
66 The Roman financiers of Ptolemy XII remained determined to restore him to power.67 Pompey persuaded Aulus Gabinius the Roman governor of Syria to invade Egypt and restore Ptolemy XII offering him 10000 talents for the proposed mission.676869 Although it put him at odds with Roman law Gabinius invaded Egypt in the spring of 55 BC by way of Hasmonean Judea where Hyrcanus II had Antipater the Idumaean father of Herod the Great furnish the Romanled army with supplies.6770 As a young cavalry officer Mark Antony was under Gabiniuss command.71 He distinguished himself by preventing Ptolemy XII from massacring the inhabitants of Pelousion and for rescuing the body of Archelaos the husband of Berenice IV after he was killed in battle ensuring him a proper royal burial.7273 Cleopatra then 14 years of age would have traveled with the Roman expedition into Egypt years later Antony would profess that he had fallen in love with her at this time.72
74 Gabinius was put on trial in Rome for abusing his authority for which he was acquitted but his second trial for accepting bribes led to his exile from which he was recalled seven years later in 48 BC by Caesar.7576 Crassus replaced him as governor of Syria and extended his provincial command to Egypt but he was killed by the Parthians at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC.7577 Ptolemy XII had Berenice IV and her wealthy supporters executed seizing their properties.787980 He allowed Gabiniuss largely Germanic and Gallic Roman garrison the Gabiniani to harass people in the streets of Alexandria and installed his longtime Roman financier Rabirius as his chief financial officer.7881
82 note 
24 Within a year Rabirius was placed under protective custody and sent back to Rome after his life was endangered for draining Egypt of its resources.8384
80 note 25 Despite these problems Ptolemy XII created a will designating Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs oversaw major construction projects such as the Temple of Edfu and a temple at Dendera and stabilized the economy.8584
86 note 26 On 31 May 52 BC Cleopatra was made a regent of Ptolemy XII as indicated by an inscription in the Temple of Hathor at Dendera.8788
89 note 27 Rabirius was unable to collect the entirety of Ptolemy XIIs debt by the time of the latters death and so it was passed on to his successors Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII.83
76 Ptolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC when Cleopatra in her first act as queen began her voyage to Hermonthis near Thebes to install a new sacred Buchis bull worshiped as an intermediary for the god Montu in the Ancient Egyptian religion.9091
92 note 29 Cleopatra faced several pressing issues and emergencies shortly after taking the throne. These included famine caused by drought and a low level of the annual flooding of the Nile and lawless behavior instigated by the Gabiniani the now unemployed and assimilated Roman soldiers left by Gabinius to garrison Egypt.9394 Inheriting her fathers debts Cleopatra also owed the Roman Republic 
17.5  million drachmas.
95 In 50 BC Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus proconsul of Syria sent his two eldest sons to Egypt most likely to negotiate with the Gabiniani and recruit them as soldiers in the desperate defense of Syria against the Parthians.96 The Gabiniani tortured and murdered these two perhaps with secret encouragement by rogue senior administrators in Cleopatras court.9697 Cleopatra sent the Gabiniani culprits to Bibulus as prisoners awaiting his judgment but he sent them back to Cleopatra and chastised her for interfering in their adjudication which was the prerogative of the Roman Senate.9897 Bibulus siding with Pompey in Caesars Civil War failed to prevent Caesar from landing a naval fleet in Greece which ultimately allowed Caesar to reach Egypt in pursuit of Pompey.
98 By 29 August 51 BC official documents started listing Cleopatra as the sole ruler evidence that she had rejected her brother Ptolemy XIII as a coruler.959799 She had probably married him77 but there is no record of this.90 The Ptolemaic practice of sibling marriage was introduced by Ptolemy II and his sister Arsinoe II.100101102 A longheld royal Egyptian practice it was loathed by contemporary Greeks.1001011
02 note 30 By the reign of Cleopatra however it was considered a normal arrangement for Ptolemaic rulers.1001011
02 Despite Cleopatras rejection of him Ptolemy XIII still retained powerful allies notably the eunuch Potheinos his childhood tutor regent and administrator of his properties.10394104 Others involved in the cabal against Cleopatra included Achillas a prominent military commander and Theodotus of Chios another tutor of Ptolemy XIII.103105 Cleopatra seems to have attempted a shortlived alliance with her brother Ptolemy XIV but by the autumn of 50 BC Ptolemy XIII had the upper hand in their conflict and began signing documents with his name before that of his sister followed by the establishment of his first regnal date in 49 BC.901061
07 note 
31 In the summer of 49 BC Cleopatra and her forces were still fighting against Ptolemy XIII within Alexandria when Pompeys son Gnaeus Pompeius arrived seeking military aid on behalf of his father.106 After returning to Italy from the wars in Gaul and crossing the Rubicon in January of 49 BC Caesar had forced Pompey and his supporters to flee to Greece.108109 In perhaps their last joint decree both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII agreed to Gnaeus Pompeiuss request and sent his father 60 ships and 500 troops including the Gabiniani a move that helped erase some of the debt owed to Rome.108110 Losing the fight against her brother Cleopatra was then forced to flee Alexandria and withdraw to the region of Thebes.111112113 By the spring of 48 BC Cleopatra had traveled to Roman Syria with her younger sister Arsinoe IV to gather an invasion force that would head to Egypt.114107115 She returned with an army but her advance to Alexandria was blocked by her brothers forces including some Gabiniani mobilized to fight against her so she camped outside Pelousion in the eastern Nile Delta.1161071
17 In Greece Caesar and Pompeys forces engaged each other at the decisive Battle of Pharsalus on 9 August 48 BC leading to the destruction of most of Pompeys army and his forced flight to Tyre Lebanon.1161181
19 note 32 Given his close relationship with the Ptolemies Pompey ultimately decided that Egypt would be his place of refuge where he could replenish his forces.1201191
17 note 33 Ptolemy XIIIs advisers however feared the idea of Pompey using Egypt as his base in a protracted Roman civil war.120121122 In a scheme devised by Theodotus Pompey arrived by ship near Pelousion after being invited by a written message only to be ambushed and stabbed to death on 28 September 48 BC.1201181
23 note 34 Ptolemy XIII believed he had demonstrated his power and simultaneously defused the situation by having Pompeys head severed and embalmed sent to Caesar who arrived in Alexandria by early October and took up residence at the royal palace.1241251
26 note 34 Caesar expressed grief and outrage over the killing of Pompey and called on both Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra to disband their forces and reconcile with each other.1241271
26 note 
35 Ptolemy XIII arrived at Alexandria at the head of his army in clear defiance of Caesars demand that he disband and leave his army before his arrival.128129 Cleopatra initially sent emissaries to Caesar but upon allegedly hearing that Caesar was inclined to having affairs with royal women she came to Alexandria to see him personally.128130129 Historian Cassius Dio records that she did so without informing her brother dressed in an attractive manner and charmed Caesar with her wit.128131132 Plutarch provides an entirely different account that alleges she was bound inside a bed sack to be smuggled into the palace to meet Caesar.1281331
34 note 
36 When Ptolemy XIII realized that his sister was in the palace consorting directly with Caesar he attempted to rouse the populace of Alexandria into a riot but he was arrested by Caesar who used his oratorical skills to calm the frenzied crowd.135136137 Caesar then brought Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII before the assembly of Alexandria where Caesar revealed the written will of Ptolemy XIIpreviously possessed by Pompeynaming Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs.1381361
30 note 37 Caesar then attempted to arrange for the other two siblings Arsinoe IV and Ptolemy XIV to rule together over Cyprus thus removing potential rival claimants to the Egyptian throne while also appeasing the Ptolemaic subjects still bitter over the loss of Cyprus to the Romans in 58 BC.1391361
40 note 
37 Judging that this agreement favored Cleopatra over Ptolemy XIII and that the latters army of 20000 including the Gabiniani could most likely defeat Caesars army of 4000 unsupported troops Potheinos decided to have Achillas lead their forces to Alexandria to attack both Caesar and Cleopatra.1391361
41 note 38 After Caesar managed to execute Potheinos Arsinoe IV joined forces with Achillas and was declared queen but soon afterward had her tutor Ganymedes kill Achillas and take his position as commander of her army.1421431
44 note 39 Ganymedes then tricked Caesar into requesting the presence of the erstwhile captive Ptolemy XIII as a negotiator only to have him join the army of Arsinoe IV.142145146 The resulting siege of the palace with Caesar and Cleopatra trapped together inside lasted into the following year of 47 BC.1471271
48 note 
40 Sometime between January and March of 47 BC Caesars reinforcements arrived including those led by Mithridates of Pergamon and Antipater the Idumaean.1421271
49 note 41 Ptolemy XIII and Arsinoe IV withdrew their forces to the Nile where Caesar attacked them. Ptolemy XIII tried to flee by boat but it capsized and he drowned.1501271
51 note 42 Ganymedes may have been killed in the battle. Theodotus was found years later in Asia by Marcus Junius Brutus and executed. Arsinoe IV was forcefully paraded in Caesars triumph in Rome before being exiled to the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus.152153154 Cleopatra was conspicuously absent from these events and resided in the palace most likely because she had been pregnant with Caesars child since September 48 BC.1551561
57 Caesars term as consul had expired at the end of 48 BC.152 However Antony an officer of his helped to secure Caesars appointment as dictator lasting for a year until October 47 BC providing Caesar with the legal authority to settle the dynastic dispute in Egypt.152 Wary of repeating the mistake of Cleopatras sister Berenice IV in having a female monarch as sole ruler Caesar appointed Cleopatras 
12 yearold brother Ptolemy XIV as joint ruler with the 
22 yearold Cleopatra in a nominal sibling marriage but Cleopatra continued living privately with Caesar.1581271
49 note 43 The exact date at which Cyprus was returned to her control is not known although she had a governor there by 42 BC.1591
49 Caesar is alleged to have joined Cleopatra for a cruise of the Nile and sightseeing of Egyptian monuments127160161 although this may be a romantic tale reflecting later welltodo Roman proclivities and not a real historical event.162 The historian Suetonius provided considerable details about the voyage including use of Thalamegos the pleasure barge constructed by Ptolemy IV which during his reign measured 90 metres 300 ft in length and 24 metres 80 ft in height and was complete with dining rooms state rooms holy shrines and promenades along its two decks resembling a floating villa.162163 Caesar could have had an interest in the Nile cruise owing to his fascination with geography he was wellread in the works of Eratosthenes and Pytheas and perhaps wanted to discover the source of the river but turned back before reaching Ethiopia.1641
65 Caesar departed from Egypt around April 47 BC allegedly to confront Pharnaces II of Pontus the son of Mithridates VI of Pontus who was stirring up trouble for Rome in Anatolia.166 It is possible that Caesar married to the prominent Roman woman Calpurnia also wanted to avoid being seen together with Cleopatra when she had their son.166160 He left three legions in Egypt later increased to four under the command of the freedman Rufio to secure Cleopatras tenuous position but also perhaps to keep her activities in check.1661671
68 Caesarion Cleopatras alleged child with Caesar was born 23 June 47 BC and was originally named Pharaoh Caesar as preserved on a stele at the Serapeum of Saqqara.1701271
71 note 44 Perhaps owing to his still childless marriage with Calpurnia Caesar remained publicly silent about Caesarion but perhaps accepted his parentage in private.1
72 note 45 Cleopatra on the other hand made repeated official declarations about Caesarions parentage naming Caesar as the father.1721731
74 Cleopatra and her nominal joint ruler Ptolemy XIV visited Rome sometime in late 46 BC presumably without Caesarion and were given lodging in Caesars villa within the Horti Caesaris.1751711
76 note 46 As with their father Ptolemy XII Caesar awarded both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIV the legal status of friend and ally of the Roman people Latin socius et amicus populi Romani in effect client rulers loyal to Rome.177178179 Cleopatras visitors at Caesars villa across the Tiber included the senator Cicero who found her arrogant.180181 Sosigenes of Alexandria one of the members of Cleopatras court aided Caesar in the calculations for the new Julian calendar put into effect 1 January 45 BC.182183184 The Temple of Venus Genetrix established in the Forum of Caesar on 25 September 46 BC contained a golden statue of Cleopatra which stood there at least until the 
3 rd century AD associating the mother of Caesars child directly with the goddess Venus mother of the Romans.185183186 The statue also subtly linked the Egyptian goddess Isis with the Roman religion.1
80 Cleopatras presence in Rome most likely had an effect on the events at the Lupercalia festival a month before Caesars assassination.187188 Antony attempted to place a royal diadem on Caesars head but the latter refused in what was most likely a staged performance perhaps to gauge the Roman publics mood about accepting Hellenisticstyle kingship.187188 Cicero who was present at the festival mockingly asked where the diadem came from an obvious reference to the Ptolemaic queen whom he abhorred.187188 Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March 15 March 44 BC but Cleopatra stayed in Rome until about midApril in the vain hope of having Caesarion recognized as Caesars heir.189190191 However Caesars will named his grandnephew Octavian as the primary heir and Octavian arrived in Italy around the same time Cleopatra decided to depart for Egypt.189190192 A few months later Cleopatra had Ptolemy XIV killed by poisoning elevating her son Caesarion as her coruler.1931941
74 note 
47 Octavian Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC in which they were each elected for fiveyear terms to restore order in the Republic and bring Caesars assassins to justice.196197 Cleopatra received messages from both Gaius Cassius Longinus one of Caesars assassins and Publius Cornelius Dolabella proconsul of Syria and Caesarian loyalist requesting military aid.196 She decided to write Cassius an excuse that her kingdom faced too many internal problems while sending the four legions left by Caesar in Egypt to Dolabella.196198 These troops were captured by Cassius in Palestine.1961
98 While Serapion Cleopatras governor of Cyprus defected to Cassius and provided him with ships Cleopatra took her own fleet to Greece to personally assist Octavian and Antony. Her ships were heavily damaged in a Mediterranean storm and she arrived too late to aid in the fighting.196199 By the autumn of 42 BC Antony had defeated the forces of Caesars assassins at the Battle of Philippi in Greece leading to the suicide of Cassius and Brutus.1962
00 By the end of 42 BC Octavian had gained control over much of the western half of the Roman Republic and Antony the eastern half with Lepidus largely marginalized.201 In the summer of 41 BC Antony established his headquarters at Tarsos in Anatolia and summoned Cleopatra there in several letters which she rebuffed until Antonys envoy Quintus Dellius convinced her to come.202203 The meeting would allow Cleopatra to clear up the misconception that she had supported Cassius during the civil war and address territorial exchanges in the Levant but Antony also undoubtedly desired to form a personal romantic relationship with the queen.204203 Cleopatra sailed up the Kydnos River to Tarsos in Thalamegos hosting Antony and his officers for two nights of lavish banquets on board the ship.2052
06 note 48 Cleopatra managed to clear her name as a supposed supporter of Cassius arguing she had really attempted to help Dolabella in Syria and convinced Antony to have her exiled sister Arsinoe IV executed at Ephesus.207208 Cleopatras former rebellious governor of Cyprus was also handed over to her for execution.2072
09 Cleopatra invited Antony to come to Egypt before departing from Tarsos which led Antony to visit Alexandria by November 41 BC.207210 Antony was well received by the populace of Alexandria both for his heroic actions in restoring Ptolemy XII to power and coming to Egypt without an occupation force like Caesar had done.211212 In Egypt Antony continued to enjoy the lavish royal lifestyle he had witnessed aboard Cleopatras ship docked at Tarsos.213209 He also had his subordinates such as Publius Ventidius Bassus drive the Parthians out of Anatolia and Syria.2122142
15 note 
49 Cleopatra carefully chose Antony as her partner for producing further heirs as he was deemed to be the most powerful Roman figure following Caesars demise.216 With his powers as a triumvir Antony also had the broad authority to restore former Ptolemaic lands which were currently in Roman hands to Cleopatra.217218 While it is clear that both Cilicia and Cyprus were under Cleopatras control by 19 November 38 BC the transfer probably occurred earlier in the winter of 4140 BC during her time spent with Antony.2
17 By the spring of 40 BC Antony left Egypt due to troubles in Syria where his governor Lucius Decidius Saxa was killed and his army taken by Quintus Labienus a former officer under Cassius who now served the Parthian Empire.219 Cleopatra provided Antony with 200 ships for his campaign and as payment for her newly acquired territories.219 She would not see Antony again until 37 BC but she maintained correspondence and evidence suggests she kept a spy in his camp.219 By the end of 40 BC Cleopatra had given birth to twins a boy named Alexander Helios and a girl named Cleopatra Selene II both of whom Antony acknowledged as his children.220221 Helios the Sun and Selene the Moon were symbolic of a new era of societal rejuvenation222 as well as an indication that Cleopatra hoped Antony would repeat the exploits of Alexander the Great by conquering the Parthians.2
12 Mark Antonys Parthian campaign in the east was disrupted by the events of the Perusine War 4140 BC initiated by his ambitious wife Fulvia against Octavian in the hopes of making her husband the undisputed leader of Rome.222223 It has been suggested that Fulvia wanted to cleave Antony away from Cleopatra but the conflict emerged in Italy even before Cleopatras meeting with Antony at Tarsos.224 Fulvia and Antonys brother Lucius Antonius were eventually besieged by Octavian at Perusia modern Perugia Italy and then exiled from Italy after which Fulvia died at Sicyon in Greece while attempting to reach Antony.225 Her sudden death led to a reconciliation of Octavian and Antony at Brundisium in Italy in September 40 BC.225212 Although the agreement struck at Brundisium solidified Antonys control of the Roman Republics territories east of the Ionian Sea it also stipulated that he concede Italia Hispania and Gaul and marry Octavians sister Octavia the Younger a potential rival for Cleopatra.2262
27 In December 40 BC Cleopatra received Herod in Alexandria as an unexpected guest and refugee who fled a turbulent situation in Judea.228 Herod had been installed as a tetrarch there by Antony but he was soon at odds with Antigonus II Mattathias of the longestablished Hasmonean dynasty.228 The latter had imprisoned Herods brother and fellow tetrarch Phasael who was executed while Herod was fleeing toward Cleopatras court.228 Cleopatra attempted to provide him with a military assignment but Herod declined and traveled to Rome where the triumvirs Octavian and Antony named him king of Judea.229230 This act put Herod on a collision course with Cleopatra who would desire to reclaim the former Ptolemaic territories that comprised his new Herodian kingdom.2
29 Relations between Antony and Cleopatra perhaps soured when he not only married Octavia but also sired her two children Antonia the Elder in 39 BC and Antonia Minor in 36 BC and moved his headquarters to Athens.234 However Cleopatras position in Egypt was secure.212 Her rival Herod was occupied with civil war in Judea that required heavy Roman military assistance but received none from Cleopatra.234 Since the authority of Antony and Octavian as triumvirs had expired on 1 January 37 BC Octavia arranged for a meeting at Tarentum where the triumvirate was officially extended to 33 BC.235 With two legions granted by Octavian and a thousand soldiers lent by Octavia Antony traveled to Antioch where he made preparations for war against the Parthians.2
36 Antony summoned Cleopatra to Antioch to discuss pressing issues such as Herods kingdom and financial support for his Parthian campaign.236237 Cleopatra brought her now threeyearold twins to Antioch where Antony saw them for the first time and where they probably first received their surnames Helios and Selene as part of Antony and Cleopatras ambitious plans for the future.238239 In order to stabilize the east Antony not only enlarged Cleopatras domain237 he also established new ruling dynasties and client rulers who would be loyal to him yet would ultimately outlast him.2402
18 note 
51 In this arrangement Cleopatra gained significant former Ptolemaic territories in the Levant including nearly all of Phoenicia Lebanon minus Tyre and Sidon which remained in Roman hands.241218237 She also received Ptolemais Akko modern Acre Israel a city that was established by Ptolemy II.241 Given her ancestral relations with the Seleucids she was granted the region of CoeleSyria along the upper Orontes River.242237 She was even given the region surrounding Jericho in Palestine but she leased this territory back to Herod.243230 At the expense of the Nabataean king Malichus I a cousin of Herod Cleopatra was also given a portion of the Nabataean Kingdom around the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea including Ailana modern Aqaba Jordan.244230 To the west Cleopatra was handed Cyrene along the Libyan coast as well as Itanos and Olous in Roman Crete.245237 Although still administered by Roman officials these territories nevertheless enriched her kingdom and led her to declare the inauguration of a new era by doubledating her coinage in 36 BC.2462
47 Antonys enlargement of the Ptolemaic realm by relinquishing directly controlled Roman territory was exploited by his rival Octavian who tapped into the public sentiment in Rome against the empowerment of a foreign queen at the expense of their Republic.248 Octavian fostering the narrative that Antony was neglecting his virtuous Roman wife Octavia granted both her and Livia his own wife extraordinary privileges of sacrosanctity.248 Some 50 years before Cornelia Africana daughter of Scipio Africanus had been the first living Roman woman to have a statue dedicated to her.246 She was now followed by Octavia and Livia whose statues were most likely erected in the Forum of Caesar to rival that of Cleopatras erected by Caesar.2
46 In 36 BC Cleopatra accompanied Antony to the Euphrates in his journey toward invading the Parthian Empire.249 She then returned to Egypt perhaps due to her advanced state of pregnancy.250 By the summer of 36 BC she had given birth to Ptolemy Philadelphus her second son with Antony.2502
37 Antonys Parthian campaign in 36 BC turned into a complete debacle for a number of reasons in particular the betrayal of Artavasdes II of Armenia who defected to the Parthian side.251218252 After losing some 30000 men more than Crassus at Carrhae an indignity he had hoped to avenge Antony finally arrived at Leukokome near Berytus modern Beirut Lebanon in December engaged in heavy drinking before Cleopatra arrived to provide funds and clothing for his battered troops.251253 Antony desired to avoid the risks involved in returning to Rome and so he traveled with Cleopatra back to Alexandria to see his newborn son.2
51 As Antony prepared for another Parthian expedition in 35 BC this time aimed at their ally Armenia Octavia traveled to Athens with 2000 troops in alleged support of Antony but most likely in a scheme devised by Octavian to embarrass him for his military losses.2562
57 note 52 Antony received these troops but told Octavia not to stray east of Athens as he and Cleopatra traveled together to Antioch only to suddenly and inexplicably abandon the military campaign and head back to Alexandria.256257 When Octavia returned to Rome Octavian portrayed his sister as a victim wronged by Antony although she refused to leave Antonys household.258218 Octavians confidence grew as he eliminated his rivals in the west including Sextus Pompeius and even Lepidus the third member of the triumvirate who was placed under house arrest after revolting against Octavian in Sicily.2582182
53 Dellius was sent as Antonys envoy to Artavasdes II in 34 BC to negotiate a potential marriage alliance that would wed the Armenian kings daughter to Alexander Helios the son of Antony and Cleopatra.259260 When this was declined Antony marched his army into Armenia defeated their forces and captured the king and Armenian royal family.259261 Antony then held a military parade in Alexandria as an imitation of a Roman triumph dressed as Dionysus and riding into the city on a chariot to present the royal prisoners to Cleopatra who was seated on a golden throne above a silver dais.259262 News of this event was heavily criticized in Rome as a perversion of timehonored Roman rites and rituals to be enjoyed instead by an Egyptian queen.2
59 In an event held at the gymnasium soon after the triumph Cleopatra dressed as Isis and declared that she was the Queen of Kings with her son Caesarion King of Kings while Alexander Helios was declared king of Armenia Media and Parthia and twoyearold Ptolemy Philadelphos was declared king of Syria and Cilicia.266267268 Cleopatra Selene II was bestowed with Crete and Cyrene.269270 Antony and Cleopatra may have been wed during this ceremony.2692
68 note 53 Antony sent a report to Rome requesting ratification of these territorial claims now known as the Donations of Alexandria. Octavian wanted to publicize it for propaganda purposes but the two consuls both supporters of Antony had it censored from public view.2712
70 In late 34 BC Antony and Octavian engaged in a heated war of propaganda that would last for years.2722701
74 note 54 Antony claimed that his rival had illegally deposed Lepidus from their triumvirate and barred him from raising troops in Italy while Octavian accused Antony of unlawfully detaining the king of Armenia marrying Cleopatra despite still being married to his sister Octavia and wrongfully claiming Caesarion as the heir of Caesar instead of Octavian.272270 The litany of accusations and gossip associated with this propaganda war have shaped the popular perceptions about Cleopatra from Augustanperiod literature through to various media in modern times.273274 Cleopatra was said to have brainwashed Mark Antony with witchcraft and sorcery and was as dangerous as Homers Helen of Troy in destroying civilization.275 Pliny the Elder claims in his Natural History that Cleopatra once dissolved a pearl worth tens of millions of sesterces in vinegar just to win a dinnerparty bet.276277 The accusation that Antony had stolen books from the Library of Pergamum to restock the Library of Alexandria later turned out to be an admitted fabrication by Gaius Calvisius Sabinus.2
78 A papyrus document dated to February 33 BC later used to wrap a mummy contains the signature of Cleopatra probably written by an official authorized to sign for her.263264 It concerns certain tax exemptions in Egypt granted to either Quintus Caecillius or Publius Canidius Crassusnote 55 a former Roman consul and Antonys confidant who would command his land forces at Actium.279264 A subscript in a different handwriting at the bottom of the papyrus reads make it happen279264 or so be it265 Ancient Greek  romanized ginsthinote 56 this is likely the autograph of the queen as it was Ptolemaic practice to countersign documents to avoid forgery.2792
64 In a speech to the Roman Senate on the first day of his consulship on 1 January 33 BC Octavian accused Antony of attempting to subvert Roman freedoms and territorial integrity as a slave to his Oriental queen.280 Before Antony and Octavians joint imperium expired on 31 December 33 BC Antony declared Caesarion as the true heir of Caesar in an attempt to undermine Octavian.280 In 32 BC the Antonian loyalists Gaius Sosius and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus became consuls. The former gave a fiery speech condemning Octavian now a private citizen without public office and introduced pieces of legislation against him.279281 During the next senatorial session Octavian entered the Senate house with armed guards and levied his own accusations against the consuls.279282 Intimidated by this act the consuls and over 200 senators still in support of Antony fled Rome the next day to join the side of Antony.2792822
83 Antony and Cleopatra traveled together to Ephesus in 32 BC where she provided him with 200 of the 800 naval ships he was able to acquire.279 Ahenobarbus wary of having Octavians propaganda confirmed to the public attempted to persuade Antony to have Cleopatra excluded from the campaign against Octavian.284285 Publius Canidius Crassus made the counterargument that Cleopatra was funding the war effort and was a competent monarch.284285 Cleopatra refused Antonys requests that she return to Egypt judging that by blocking Octavian in Greece she could more easily defend Egypt.284285 Cleopatras insistence that she be involved in the battle for Greece led to the defections of prominent Romans such as Ahenobarbus and Lucius Munatius Plancus.2842
82 During the spring of 32 BC Antony and Cleopatra traveled to Athens where she persuaded Antony to send Octavia an official declaration of divorce.284282268 This encouraged Plancus to advise Octavian that he should seize Antonys will invested with the Vestal Virgins.284282270 Although a violation of sacred and legal rights Octavian forcefully acquired the document from the Temple of Vesta and it became a useful tool in the propaganda war against Antony and Cleopatra.284270 Octavian highlighted parts of the will such as Caesarion being named heir to Caesar that the Donations of Alexandria were legal that Antony should be buried alongside Cleopatra in Egypt instead of Rome and that Alexandria would be made the new capital of the Roman Republic.286282270 In a show of loyalty to Rome Octavian decided to begin construction of his own mausoleum at the Campus Martius.282 Octavians legal standing was also improved by being elected consul in 31 BC.282 With Antonys will made public Octavian had his casus belli and Rome declared war on Cleopatra286287288 not Antony.note 57 The legal argument for war was based less on Cleopatras territorial acquisitions with former Roman territories ruled by her children with Antony and more on the fact that she was providing military support to a private citizen now that Antonys triumviral authority had expired.2
89 Antony and Cleopatra had a larger fleet than Octavian but the crews of Antony and Cleopatras navy were not all welltrained some of them perhaps from merchant vessels whereas Octavian had a fully professional force.290285 Antony wanted to cross the Adriatic Sea and blockade Octavian at either Tarentum or Brundisium291 but Cleopatra concerned primarily with defending Egypt overrode the decision to attack Italy directly.292285 Antony and Cleopatra set up their winter headquarters at Patrai in Greece and by the spring of 31 BC they had moved to Actium on the southern side of the Ambracian Gulf.2922
91 Cleopatra and Antony had the support of various allied kings but Cleopatra had already been in conflict with Herod and an earthquake in Judea provided him with an excuse to be absent from the campaign.293 They also lost the support of Malichus I which would prove to have strategic consequences.294 Antony and Cleopatra lost several skirmishes against Octavian around Actium during the summer of 31 BC while defections to Octavians camp continued including Antonys longtime companion Dellius294 and the allied kings Amyntas of Galatia and Deiotaros of Paphlagonia.294 While some in Antonys camp suggested abandoning the naval conflict to retreat inland Cleopatra urged for a naval confrontation to keep Octavians fleet away from Egypt.2
95 On 2 September 31 BC the naval forces of Octavian led by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa met those of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium.295291287 Cleopatra aboard her flagship the Antonias commanded 60 ships at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf at the rear of the fleet in what was likely a move by Antonys officers to marginalize her during the battle.295 Antony had ordered that their ships should have sails on board for a better chance to pursue or flee from the enemy which Cleopatra ever concerned about defending Egypt used to swiftly move through the area of major combat in a strategic withdrawal to the Peloponnese.2962972
98 Burstein writes that partisan Roman writers would later accuse Cleopatra of cowardly deserting Antony but their original intention of keeping their sails on board may have been to break the blockade and salvage as much of their fleet as possible.298 Antony followed Cleopatra and boarded her ship identified by its distinctive purple sails as the two escaped the battle and headed for Tainaron.296 Antony reportedly avoided Cleopatra during this threeday voyage until her ladies in waiting at Tainaron urged him to speak with her.299 The Battle of Actium raged on without Cleopatra and Antony until the morning of 3 September and was followed by massive defections of officers troops and allied kings to Octavians side.2992973
00 While Octavian occupied Athens Antony and Cleopatra landed at Paraitonion in Egypt.299303 The couple then went their separate ways Antony to Cyrene to raise more troops and Cleopatra to the harbor at Alexandria in an attempt to mislead the oppositional party and portray the activities in Greece as a victory.299 She was afraid that news about the outcome of the battle of Actium would lead to a rebellion.304 It is uncertain whether or not at this time she actually executed Artavasdes II and sent his head to his rival Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene in an attempt to strike an alliance with him.3053
06 Lucius Pinarius Mark Antonys appointed governor of Cyrene received word that Octavian had won the Battle of Actium before Antonys messengers could arrive at his court.305 Pinarius had these messengers executed and then defected to Octavians side surrendering to him the four legions under his command that Antony desired to obtain.305 Antony nearly committed suicide after hearing news of this but was stopped by his staff officers.305 In Alexandria he built a reclusive cottage on the island of Pharos that he nicknamed the Timoneion after the philosopher Timon of Athens who was famous for his cynicism and misanthropy.305 Herod who had personally advised Antony after the Battle of Actium that he should betray Cleopatra traveled to Rhodes to meet Octavian and resign his kingship out of loyalty to Antony.307 Octavian was impressed by his speech and sense of loyalty so he allowed him to maintain his position in Judea further isolating Antony and Cleopatra.3
07 Cleopatra perhaps started to view Antony as a liability by the late summer of 31 BC when she prepared to leave Egypt to her son Caesarion.308 Cleopatra planned to relinquish her throne to him take her fleet from the Mediterranean into the Red Sea and then set sail to a foreign port perhaps in India where she could spend time recuperating.308306 However these plans were ultimately abandoned when Malichus I as advised by Octavians governor of Syria Quintus Didius managed to burn Cleopatras fleet in revenge for his losses in a war with Herod that Cleopatra had largely initiated.308306 Cleopatra had no other option but to stay in Egypt and negotiate with Octavian.308 Although most likely later proOctavian propaganda it was reported that at this time Cleopatra started testing the strengths of various poisons on prisoners and even her own servants.3
09 Cleopatra had Caesarion enter into the ranks of the ephebi which along with reliefs on a stele from Koptos dated 21 September 31 BC demonstrated that Cleopatra was now grooming her son to become the sole ruler of Egypt.310 In a show of solidarity Antony also had Marcus Antonius Antyllus his son with Fulvia enter the ephebi at the same time.308 Separate messages and envoys from Antony and Cleopatra were then sent to Octavian still stationed at Rhodes although Octavian seems to have replied only to Cleopatra.309 Cleopatra requested that her children should inherit Egypt and that Antony should be allowed to live in exile in Egypt offered Octavian money in the future and immediately sent him lavish gifts.309306 Octavian sent his diplomat Thyrsos to Cleopatra after she threatened to burn herself and vast amounts of her treasure within a tomb already under construction.311 Thyrsos advised her to kill Antony so that her life would be spared but when Antony suspected foul intent he had this diplomat flogged and sent back to Octavian without a deal.3
12 After lengthy negotiations that ultimately produced no results Octavian set out to invade Egypt in the spring of 30 BC313 stopping at Ptolemais in Phoenicia where his new ally Herod provided his army with fresh supplies.314 Octavian moved south and swiftly took Pelousion while Cornelius Gallus marching eastward from Cyrene defeated Antonys forces near Paraitonion.315316 Octavian advanced quickly to Alexandria but Antony returned and won a small victory over Octavians tired troops outside the citys hippodrome.315316 However on 1 August 30 BC Antonys naval fleet surrendered to Octavian followed by Antonys cavalry.3152973
17 Cleopatra hid herself in her tomb with her close attendants and sent a message to Antony that she had committed suicide.315318319 In despair Antony responded to this by stabbing himself in the stomach and taking his own life at age 
53.3 15297306 According to Plutarch he was still dying when brought to Cleopatra at her tomb telling her he had died honorably and that she could trust Octavians companion Gaius Proculeius over anyone else in his entourage.315320321 It was Proculeius however who infiltrated her tomb using a ladder and detained the queen denying her the ability to burn herself with her treasures.322323 Cleopatra was then allowed to embalm and bury Antony within her tomb before she was escorted to the palace.3223
06 Octavian entered Alexandria occupied the palace and seized Cleopatras three youngest children.322324 When she met with Octavian Cleopatra told him bluntly I will not be led in a triumph Ancient Greek   romanized ou thriambusomai according to Livy a rare recording of her exact words.325326 Octavian promised that he would keep her alive but offered no explanation about his future plans for her kingdom.327 When a spy informed her that Octavian planned to move her and her children to Rome in three days she prepared for suicide as she had no intentions of being paraded in a Roman triumph like her sister Arsinoe IV.327297306 It is unclear if Cleopatras suicide on 10 August 30 BC at age 39 took place within the palace or her tomb.3283
29 note 4 It is said she was accompanied by her servants Eiras and Charmion who also took their own lives.3273
30 Octavian was said to have been angered by this outcome but had Cleopatra buried in royal fashion next to Antony in her tomb.327331332 Cleopatras physician Olympos did not explain her cause of death although the popular belief is that she allowed an asp or Egyptian cobra to bite and poison her.333334306 Plutarch relates this tale but then suggests an implement  knstis lit. spine cheesegrater was used to introduce the toxin by scratching while Dio says that she injected the poison with a needle  beln and Strabo argued for an ointment of some kind.3353343
36 note 58 No venomous snake was found with her body but she did have tiny puncture wounds on her arm that could have been caused by a needle.3333363
32 Cleopatra decided in her last moments to send Caesarion away to Upper Egypt perhaps with plans to flee to Kushite Nubia Ethiopia or India.337338316 Caesarion now Ptolemy XV would reign for a mere 18 days until executed on the orders of Octavian on 29 August 30 BC after returning to Alexandria under the false pretense that Octavian would allow him to be king.3393403
41 note 2 Octavian was convinced by the advice of the philosopher Arius Didymus that there was room for only one Caesar in the world.3
42 note 59 With the fall of the Ptolemaic Kingdom the Roman province of Egypt was established3432973
44 note 60 marking the end of the Hellenistic period.3453
46 note 9 In January of 27 BC Octavian was renamed Augustus the revered and amassed constitutional powers that established him as the first Roman emperor inaugurating the Principate era of the Roman Empire.3
47 Following the tradition of Macedonian rulers Cleopatra ruled Egypt and other territories such as Cyprus as an absolute monarch serving as the sole lawgiver of her kingdom.349 She was the chief religious authority in her realm presiding over religious ceremonies dedicated to the deities of both the Egyptian and Greek polytheistic faiths.350 She oversaw the construction of various temples to Egyptian and Greek gods351 a synagogue for the Jews in Egypt and even built the Caesareum of Alexandria dedicated to the cult worship of her patron and lover Julius Caesar.3523
53 Cleopatra was directly involved in the administrative affairs of her domain354 tackling crises such as famine by ordering royal granaries to distribute food to the starving populace during a drought at the beginning of her reign.355 Although the command economy that she managed was more of an ideal than a reality356 the government attempted to impose price controls tariffs and state monopolies for certain goods fixed exchange rates for foreign currencies and rigid laws forcing peasant farmers to stay in their villages during planting and harvesting seasons.357358359 Apparent financial troubles led Cleopatra to debase her coinage which included silver and bronze currencies but no gold coins like those of some of her distant Ptolemaic predecessors.3
60 After her suicide Cleopatras three surviving children Cleopatra Selene II Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphos were sent to Rome with Octavians sister Octavia the Younger a former wife of their father as their guardian.365366 Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios were present in the Roman triumph of Octavian in 29 BC.365239 The fates of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus are unknown after this point.365239 Octavia arranged the betrothal of Cleopatra Selene II to Juba II son of Juba I whose North African kingdom of Numidia had been turned into a Roman province in 46 BC by Julius Caesar due to Juba Is support of Pompey.3673663
24 The emperor Augustus installed Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II after their wedding in 25 BC as the new rulers of Mauretania where they transformed the old Carthaginian city of Iol into their new capital renamed Caesarea Mauretaniae modern Cherchell Algeria.367239 Cleopatra Selene II imported many important scholars artists and advisers from her mothers royal court in Alexandria to serve her in Caesarea now permeated in Hellenistic Greek culture.368 She also named her son Ptolemy of Mauretania in honor of their Ptolemaic dynastic heritage.3693
70 Cleopatra Selene II died c.5 BC and when Juba II died in 2324 AD he was succeeded by his son Ptolemy.369371 However Ptolemy was eventually executed by the Roman emperor Caligula in 40 AD perhaps under the pretense that Ptolemy had unlawfully minted his own royal coinage and utilized regalia reserved for the Roman emperor.372373 Ptolemy of Mauretania was the last known monarch of the Ptolemaic dynasty although Queen Zenobia of the shortlived Palmyrene Empire during the Crisis of the Third Century claimed descent from Cleopatra.374375 A cult dedicated to Cleopatra still existed as late as 373 AD when Petesenufe an Egyptian scribe of the book of Isis explained that he overlaid the figure of Cleopatra with gold.3
76 Although almost 50 ancient works of Roman historiography mention Cleopatra these often include only terse accounts of the Battle of Actium her suicide and Augustan propaganda about her personal deficiencies.378 Despite not being a biography of Cleopatra the Life of Antonius written by Plutarch in the 
1 st century AD provides the most thorough surviving account of Cleopatras life.379380381 Plutarch lived a century after Cleopatra but relied on primary sources such as Philotas of Amphissa who had access to the Ptolemaic royal palace Cleopatras personal physician named Olympos and Quintus Dellius a close confidant of Mark Antony and Cleopatra.382 Plutarchs work included both the Augustan view of Cleopatrawhich became canonical for his periodas well as sources outside of this tradition such as eyewitness reports.3793
81 The Jewish Roman historian Josephus writing in the 
1 st century AD provides valuable information on the life of Cleopatra via her diplomatic relationship with Herod the Great.383384 However this work relies largely on Herods memoirs and the biased account of Nicolaus of Damascus the tutor of Cleopatras children in Alexandria before he moved to Judea to serve as an adviser and chronicler at Herods court.383384 The Roman History published by the official and historian Cassius Dio in the early 
3 rd century AD while failing to fully comprehend the complexities of the late Hellenistic world nevertheless provides a continuous history of the era of Cleopatras reign.3
83 Cleopatra is barely mentioned in De Bello Alexandrino the memoirs of an unknown staff officer who served under Caesar.3873883
89 note 62 The writings of Cicero who knew her personally provide an unflattering portrait of Cleopatra.387 The Augustanperiod authors Virgil Horace Propertius and Ovid perpetuated the negative views of Cleopatra approved by the ruling Roman regime387390 although Virgil established the idea of Cleopatra as a figure of romance and epic melodrama.3
91 note 63 Horace also viewed Cleopatras suicide as a positive choice392390 an idea that found acceptance by the Late Middle Ages with Geoffrey Chaucer.3933
94 The historians Strabo Velleius Valerius Maximus Pliny the Elder and Appian while not offering accounts as full as Plutarch Josephus or Dio provided some details of her life that had not survived in other historical records.3
87 note 64 Inscriptions on contemporary Ptolemaic coinage and some Egyptian papyrus documents demonstrate Cleopatras point of view but this material is very limited in comparison to Roman literary works.3873
95 note 65 The fragmentary Libyka commissioned by Cleopatras soninlaw Juba II provides a glimpse at a possible body of historiographic material that supported Cleopatras perspective.3
87 Cleopatras gender has perhaps led to her depiction as a minor if not insignificant figure in ancient medieval and even modern historiography about ancient Egypt and the GrecoRoman world.396 For instance the historian Ronald Syme asserted that she was of little importance to Caesar and that the propaganda of Octavian magnified her importance to an excessive degree.396 Although the common view of Cleopatra was one of a prolific seductress she had only two known sexual partners Caesar and Antony the two most prominent Romans of the time period who were most likely to ensure the survival of her dynasty.397398 Plutarch described Cleopatra as having had a stronger personality and charming wit than physical beauty.399154
00 note 
66 Cleopatra was depicted in various ancient works of art in the Egyptian as well as HellenisticGreek and Roman styles.2 Surviving works include statues busts reliefs and minted coins2377 as well as ancient carved cameos403 such as one depicting Cleopatra and Antony in Hellenistic style now in the Altes Museum Berlin.1 Contemporary images of Cleopatra were produced both in and outside of Ptolemaic Egypt. For instance there was once a large gilded bronze statue of Cleopatra inside the Temple of Venus Genetrix in Rome the first time that a living person had their statue placed next to that of a deity in a Roman temple.3185404 It was erected there by Caesar and remained in the temple at least until the 
3 rd century AD its preservation perhaps owing to Caesars patronage although Augustus did not remove or destroy artworks in Alexandria depicting Cleopatra.4054
06 A lifesized Romanstyle statue of Cleopatra was found near the Tomba di Nerone it Rome along the Via Cassia and is now housed in the Museo PioClementino part of the Vatican Museums.1385386 Plutarch in his Life of Antonius said that the public statues of Antony were torn down by Augustus but those of Cleopatra were preserved following her death thanks to her friend Archibius paying the emperor 2000 talents to dissuade him from destroying hers.4073763
31 Since the 19
50 s scholars have debated whether or not the Esquiline Venusdiscovered in 1874 on the Esquiline Hill in Rome and housed in the Palazzo dei Conservatori of the Capitoline Museumsis a depiction of Cleopatra based on the statues hairstyle and facial features apparent royal diadem worn over the head and the uraeus Egyptian cobra wrapped around the base.402408409 Detractors of this theory argue that the face in this statue is thinner than the face on the Berlin portrait and assert that it was unlikely she would be depicted as the naked goddess Venus or the Greek Aphrodite.402408409 However she was depicted in an Egyptian statue as the goddess Isis410 while some of her coinage depicts her as VenusAphrodite.411412 She also dressed as Aphrodite when meeting Antony at Tarsos.206 The Esquiline Venus is generally thought to be a mid
1 stcentury AD Roman copy of a 
1 stcentury BC Greek original from the school of Pasiteles.4
08 Surviving coinage of Cleopatras reign include specimens from every regnal year from 51 to 30 BC.414 Cleopatra the only Ptolemaic queen to issue coins on her own behalf almost certainly inspired her partner Caesar to become the first living Roman to present his portrait on his own coins.4
11 note 67 Cleopatra was the first foreign queen to have her image appear on Roman currency.415 Coins dated to the period of her marriage to Antony which also bear his image portray the queen as having a very similar aquiline nose and prominent chin as that of her husband.3416 These similar facial features followed an artistic convention that represented the mutuallyobserved harmony of a royal couple.
32 Her strong almost masculine facial features in these particular coins are strikingly different from the smoother softer and perhaps idealized sculpted images of her in either the Egyptian or Hellenistic styles.2417418 Her masculine facial features on minted currency are similar to that of her father Ptolemy XII Auletes419115 and perhaps also to those of her Ptolemaic ancestor Arsinoe II 316260 BC2420 and even depictions of earlier queens such as Hatshepsut and Nefertiti.418 It is likely due to political expediency that Antonys visage was made to conform not only to hers but also to those of her Macedonian Greek ancestors who founded the Ptolemaic dynasty to familiarize himself to her subjects as a legitimate member of the royal house.
2 The inscriptions on the coins are written in Greek but also in the nominative case of Roman coins rather than the genitive case of Greek coins in addition to having the letters placed in a circular fashion along the edges of the coin instead of across it horizontally or vertically as was customary for Greek ones.2 These facets of their coinage represent the synthesis of Roman and Hellenistic culture and perhaps also a statement to their subjects however ambiguous to modern scholars about the superiority of either Antony or Cleopatra over the other.2 Diana Kleiner argues that Cleopatra in one of her coins minted with the dual image of her husband Antony made herself more masculinelooking than other portraits and more like an acceptable Roman client queen than a Hellenistic ruler.417 Cleopatra had actually achieved this masculine look in coinage predating her affair with Antony such as the coins struck at the Ascalon mint during her brief period of exile to Syria and the Levant which Joann Fletcher explains as her attempt to appear like her father and as a legitimate successor to a male Ptolemaic ruler.1154
21 Various coins such as a silver tetradrachm minted sometime after Cleopatras marriage with Antony in 37 BC depict her wearing a royal diadem and a melon hairstyle.3421 The combination of this hairstyle with a diadem is also featured in two surviving sculpted marble heads.4223774
23 note 68 This hairstyle with hair braided back into a bun is the same as that worn by her Ptolemaic ancestors Arsinoe II and Berenice II in their own coinage.3424 After her visit to Rome in 4644 BC it became fashionable for Roman women to adopt it as one of their hairstyles but it was abandoned for a more modest austere look during the conservative rule of Augustus.34224
23 Of the surviving GrecoRomanstyle busts and heads of Cleopatranote 69 the sculpture known as the Berlin Cleopatra located in the Antikensammlung Berlin collection at the Altes Museum possesses her full nose whereas the head known as the Vatican Cleopatra located in the Vatican Museums is damaged with a missing nose.4254264
27 note 70 Both the Berlin Cleopatra and Vatican Cleopatra have royal diadems similar facial features and perhaps once resembled the face of her bronze statue housed in the Temple of Venus Genetrix.4264284
27 note 
71 Both heads are dated to the mid
1 st century BC and were found in Roman villas along the Via Appia in Italy the Vatican Cleopatra having been unearthed in the Villa of the Quintilii.34254
27 note 72 Francisco Pina Polo writes that Cleopatras coinage present her image with certainty and asserts that the sculpted portrait of the Berlin head is confirmed as having a similar profile with her hair pulled back into a bun a diadem and a hooked nose.4
29 note 
73 A third sculpted portrait of Cleopatra accepted by scholars as being authentic survives at the Archaeological Museum of Cherchell Algeria.406361362 This portrait features the royal diadem and similar facial features as the Berlin and Vatican heads but has a more unique hairstyle and may actually depict Cleopatra Selene II daughter of Cleopatra.3624302
33 note 50 A possible Parianmarble sculpture of Cleopatra wearing a vulture headdress in Egyptian style is located at the Capitoline Museums.431 Discovered near a sanctuary of Isis in Rome and dated to the 
1 st century BC it is either Roman or HellenisticEgyptian in origin.4
32 Other possible sculpted depictions of Cleopatra include one in the British Museum London made of limestone which perhaps only depicts a woman in her entourage during her trip to Rome.1422 The woman in this portrait has facial features similar to others including the pronounced aquiline nose but lacks a royal diadem and sports a different hairstyle.1422 However the British Museum head once belonging to a full statue could potentially represent Cleopatra at a different stage in her life and may also betray an effort by Cleopatra to discard the use of royal insignia i.e. the diadem to make herself more appealing to the citizens of Republican Rome.422 Duane W. Roller speculates that the British Museum head along with those in the Egyptian Museum Cairo the Capitoline Museums and in the private collection of Maurice Nahmen while having similar facial features and hairstyles as the Berlin portrait but lacking a royal diadem most likely represent members of the royal court or even Roman women imitating Cleopatras popular hairstyle.4
33 In the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii Italy a mid
1 st century BC Second Style wall painting of the goddess Venus holding a cupid near massive temple doors is most likely a depiction of Cleopatra as Venus Genetrix with her son Caesarion.408434 The commission of the painting most likely coincides with the erection of the Temple of Venus Genetrix in the Forum of Caesar in September 46 BC where Caesar had a gilded statue erected depicting Cleopatra.408434 This statue likely formed the basis of her depictions in both sculpted art as well as this painting at Pompeii.4084
35 The woman in the painting wears a royal diadem over her head and is strikingly similar in appearance to the Vatican Cleopatra which bears possible marks on the marble of its left cheek where a cupids arm may have been torn off.4084364
27 note 74 The room with the painting was walled off by its owner perhaps in reaction to the execution of Caesarion in 30 BC by order of Octavian when public depictions of Cleopatras son would have been unfavorable with the new Roman regime.4084
37 Behind her golden diadem crowned with a red jewel is a translucent veil with crinkles that suggest the melon hairstyle favored by the queen.4
36 note 75 Her ivorywhite skin round face long aquiline nose and large round eyes were features common in both Roman and Ptolemaic depictions of deities.436 Roller affirms that there seems little doubt that this is a depiction of Cleopatra and Caesarion before the doors of the Temple of Venus in the Forum Julium and as such it becomes the only extant contemporary painting of the queen.4
08 Another painting from Pompeii dated to the early 
1 st century AD and located in the House of Giuseppe II contains a possible depiction of Cleopatra with her son Caesarion both wearing royal diadems while she reclines and consumes poison in an act of suicide.3013
02 note 76 The painting was originally thought to depict the Carthaginian noblewoman Sophonisba who toward the end of the Second Punic War 218201 BC drank poison and committed suicide at the behest of her lover Masinissa King of Numidia.301 Arguments in favor of it depicting Cleopatra include the strong connection of her house with that of the Numidian royal family Masinissa and Ptolemy VIII Physcon having been associates and Cleopatras own daughter marrying the Numidian prince Juba II.3
01 Sophonisba was also a more obscure figure when the painting was made while Cleopatras suicide was far more famous.301 An asp is absent from the painting but many Romans held the view that she received poison in another manner than a venomous snakebite.441 A set of double doors on the rear wall of the painting positioned very high above the people in it suggests the described layout of Cleopatras tomb in Alexandria.301 A male servant holds the mouth of an artificial Egyptian crocodile possibly an elaborate tray handle while another man standing by is dressed as a Roman.3
01 In 1818 a now lost encaustic painting was discovered in the Temple of Serapis at Hadrians Villa near Tivoli Lazio Italy that depicted Cleopatra committing suicide with an asp biting her bare chest.438 A chemical analysis performed in 1822 confirmed that the medium for the painting was composed of onethird wax and twothirds resin.438 The thickness of the painting over Cleopatras bare flesh and her drapery were reportedly similar to the paintings of the Fayum mummy portraits.442 A steel engraving published by John Sartain in 1885 depicting the painting as described in the archaeological report shows Cleopatra wearing authentic clothing and jewelry of Egypt in the late Hellenistic period443 as well as the radiant crown of the Ptolemaic rulers as seen in their portraits on various coins minted during their respective reigns.440 After Cleopatras suicide Octavian commissioned a painting to be made depicting her being bitten by a snake parading this image in her stead during his triumphal procession in Rome.442337313 The portrait painting of Cleopatras death was perhaps among the great number of artworks and treasures taken from Rome by Emperor Hadrian to decorate his private villa where it was found in an Egyptian temple.4

77 A Roman panel painting from Herculaneum Italy dated to the 
1 st century AD possibly depicts Cleopatra.4748 In it she wears a royal diadem red or reddishbrown hair pulled back into a bunnote 78 pearlstudded hairpins444 and earrings with ballshaped pendants the white skin of her face and neck set against a stark black background.47 Her hair and facial features are similar to those in the sculpted Berlin and Vatican portraits as well as her coinage.47 A highly similar painted bust of a woman with a blue headband in the House of the Orchard at Pompeii features Egyptianstyle imagery such as a Greekstyle sphinx and may have been created by the same artist.
47 The Portland Vase a Roman cameo glass vase dated to the Augustan period and now in the British Museum includes a possible depiction of Cleopatra with Antony.445447 In this interpretation Cleopatra can be seen grasping Antony and drawing him toward her while a serpent i.e. the asp rises between her legs Eros floats above and Anton the alleged ancestor of the Antonian family looks on in despair as his descendant Antony is led to his doom.445446 The other side of the vase perhaps contains a scene of Octavia abandoned by her husband Antony but watched over by her brother the emperor Augustus.445446 The vase would thus have been created no earlier than 35 BC when Antony sent his wife Octavia back to Italy and stayed with Cleopatra in Alexandria.4
45 The Bust of Cleopatra in the Royal Ontario Museum represents a bust of Cleopatra in the Egyptian style.448 Dated to the mid
1 st century BC it is perhaps the earliest depiction of Cleopatra as both a goddess and ruling pharaoh of Egypt.448 The sculpture also has pronounced eyes that share similarities with Roman copies of Ptolemaic sculpted works of art.449 The Dendera Temple complex near Dendera Egypt contains Egyptianstyle carved relief images along the exterior walls of the Temple of Hathor depicting Cleopatra and her young son Caesarion as a grown adult and ruling pharaoh making offerings to the gods.450451 Augustus had his name inscribed there following the death of Cleopatra.4504
52 A large Ptolemaic black basalt statue measuring 104 centimetres 41 in in height now in the Hermitage Museum Saint Petersburg is thought to represent Arsinoe II wife of Ptolemy II but recent analysis has indicated that it could depict her descendant Cleopatra due to the three uraei adorning her headdress an increase from the two used by Arsinoe II to symbolize her rule over Lower and Upper Egypt.407403401 The woman in the basalt statue also holds a divided double cornucopia dikeras which can be seen on coins of both Arsinoe II and Cleopatra.407401 In his Kleopatra und die Caesaren 2006 Bernard Andreae de contends that this basalt statue like other idealized Egyptian portraits of the queen does not contain realistic facial features and hence adds little to the knowledge of her appearance.4
53 note 79 Adrian Goldsworthy writes that despite these representations in the traditional Egyptian style Cleopatra would have dressed as a native only perhaps for certain rites and instead would usually dress as a Greek monarch which would include the Greek headband seen in her GrecoRoman busts.4
54 In modern times Cleopatra has become an icon of popular culture377 a reputation shaped by theatrical representations dating back to the Renaissance as well as paintings and films.457 This material largely surpasses the scope and size of existent historiographic literature about her from classical antiquity and has made a greater impact on the general publics view of Cleopatra than the latter.458 The 
14 thcentury English poet Geoffrey Chaucer in The Legend of Good Women contextualized Cleopatra for the Christian world of the Middle Ages.459 His depiction of Cleopatra and Antony her shining knight engaged in courtly love has been interpreted in modern times as being either playful or misogynistic satire.4
59 Chaucer highlighted Cleopatras relationships with only two men as hardly the life of a seductress and wrote his works partly in reaction to the negative depiction of Cleopatra in De Mulieribus Claris and De Casibus Virorum Illustrium Latin works by the 
14 thcentury Italian poet Giovanni Boccaccio.460394 The Renaissance humanist Bernardino Cacciante it in his 1504 Libretto apologetico delle donne was the first Italian to defend the reputation of Cleopatra and criticize the perceived moralizing and misogyny in Boccaccios works.461 Works of Islamic historiography written in Arabic covered the reign of Cleopatra such as the 
10 thcentury Meadows of Gold by AlMasudi462 although his work erroneously claimed that Octavian died soon after Cleopatras suicide.4
63 Cleopatra appeared in miniatures for illuminated manuscripts such as a depiction of her and Antony lying in a Gothicstyle tomb by the Boucicaut Master in 14
09.3 93 In the visual arts the sculpted depiction of Cleopatra as a freestanding nude figure committing suicide began with the 
16 thcentury sculptors Bartolommeo Bandinelli and Alessandro Vittoria.464 Early prints depicting Cleopatra include designs by the Renaissance artists Raphael and Michelangelo as well as 
15 thcentury woodcuts in illustrated editions of Boccaccios works.4
65 In the performing arts the death of Elizabeth I of England in 1603 and the German publication in 1606 of alleged letters of Cleopatra inspired Samuel Daniel to alter and republish his 1594 play Cleopatra in 16
07.4 66 He was followed by William Shakespeare whose Antony and Cleopatra largely based on Plutarch was first performed in 1608 and provided a somewhat salacious view of Cleopatra in stark contrast to Englands own Virgin Queen.467 Cleopatra was also featured in operas such as George Frideric Handels 1724 Giulio Cesare in Egitto which portrayed the love affair of Caesar and Cleopatra468 Domenico Cimarosa wrote Cleopatra on a similar subject in 17

69 In Victorian Britain Cleopatra was highly associated with many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture and her image was used to market various household products including oil lamps lithographs postcards and cigarettes.470 Fictional novels such as H. Rider Haggards Cleopatra 1889 and Thophile Gautiers One of Cleopatras Nights 1838 depicted the queen as a sensual and mystic Easterner while the Egyptologist Georg Eberss Cleopatra 1894 was more grounded in historical accuracy.470471 The French dramatist Victorien Sardou and Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw produced plays about Cleopatra while burlesque shows such as F. C. Burnands Antony and Cleopatra offered satirical depictions of the queen connecting her and the environment she lived in with the modern age.4
72 Shakespeares Antony and Cleopatra was considered canonical by the Victorian era.473 Its popularity led to the perception that the 1885 painting by Lawrence AlmaTadema depicted the meeting of Antony and Cleopatra on her pleasure barge in Tarsus although AlmaTadema revealed in a private letter that it depicts a subsequent meeting of theirs in Alexandria.474 Also based on Shakespeares play was Samuel Barbers opera Antony and Cleopatra 1966 commissioned for the opening of the Metropolitan Opera House.475 In his unfinished 1825 short story The Egyptian Nights Alexander Pushkin popularized the claims of the 
4 thcentury Roman historian Aurelius Victor previously largely ignored that Cleopatra had prostituted herself to men who paid for sex with their lives.476477 Cleopatra also became appreciated outside the Western world and Middle East as the Qingdynasty Chinese scholar Yan Fu wrote an extensive biography of her.4
78 Georges Mliss Robbing Cleopatras Tomb French Cloptre an 1899 French silent horror film was the first film to depict the character of Cleopatra.479 Hollywood films of the 
20 th century were influenced by earlier Victorian media which helped to shape the character of Cleopatra played by Theda Bara in Cleopatra 1917 Claudette Colbert in Cleopatra 1934 and Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra 19
63.4 80 In addition to her portrayal as a vampire queen Baras Cleopatra also incorporated tropes familiar from 
19 thcentury Orientalist painting such as despotic behavior mixed with dangerous and overt female sexuality.481 Colberts character of Cleopatra served as a glamour model for selling Egyptianthemed products in department stores in the 19
30 s targeting female moviegoers.482 In preparation for the film starring Taylor as Cleopatra womens magazines of the early 19
60 s advertised how to use makeup clothes jewelry and hairstyles to achieve the Egyptian look similar to the queens Cleopatra and Nefertiti.483 By the end of the 
20 th century there were fortythree films two hundred plays and novels fortyfive operas and five ballets associated with Cleopatra.4
84 Whereas myths about Cleopatra persist in popular media important aspects of her career go largely unnoticed such as her command of naval forces and administrative acts. Publications on ancient Greek medicine attributed to her are likely to be the work of a physician by the same name writing in the late first century AD.485 Ingrid D. Rowland who highlights that the Berenice called Cleopatra cited by the 
3 rd or 
4 thcentury female Roman physician Metrodora was likely conflated by medieval scholars as referring to Cleopatra.486 Only fragments exist of these medical and cosmetic writings such as those preserved by Galen including remedies for hair disease baldness and dandruff along with a list of weights and measures for pharmacological purposes.48718488 Atius of Amida attributed a recipe for perfumed soap to Cleopatra while Paul of Aegina preserved alleged instructions of hers for dyeing and curling hair.4
87 Cleopatra belonged to the Macedonian Greek dynasty of the Ptolemies74904
91 note 80 their European origins tracing back to northern Greece.492 Through her father Ptolemy XII Auletes she was a descendant of two prominent companions of Alexander the Great of Macedon the general Ptolemy I Soter founder of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt and Seleucus I Nicator the Macedonian Greek founder of the Seleucid Empire of West Asia.74934
94 note 81 While Cleopatras paternal line can be traced the identity of her mother is uncertain.4954964
97 note 82 She was presumably the daughter of Cleopatra V Tryphaenanote 3 the sisterwife of Ptolemy XII who had previously given birth to their daughter Berenice IV.124964
98 note 
83 Cleopatra I Syra was the only member of the Ptolemaic dynasty known for certain to have introduced some nonGreek ancestry.499500 Her mother Laodice III was a daughter born to King Mithridates II of Pontus a Persian of the Mithridatic dynasty and his wife Laodice who had a mixed GreekPersian heritage.501 Cleopatra I Syras father Antiochus III the Great was a descendant of Queen Apama the Sogdian Iranian wife of Seleucus I Nicator.4995005
02 note 84 It is generally believed that the Ptolemies did not intermarry with native Egyptians.395
03 note 85 Michael Grant asserts that there is only one known Egyptian mistress of a Ptolemy and no known Egyptian wife of a Ptolemy further arguing that Cleopatra probably did not have any Egyptian ancestry and would have described herself as Greek.4
99 note 
86 Stacy Schiff writes that Cleopatra was a Macedonian Greek with some Persian ancestry arguing that it was rare for the Ptolemies to have an Egyptian mistress.5
04 note 87 Duane W. Roller speculates that Cleopatra could have been the daughter of a theoretical halfMacedonianGreek halfEgyptian woman from Memphis in northern Egypt belonging to a family of priests dedicated to Ptah a hypothesis not generally accepted in scholarshipnote 88 but contends that whatever Cleopatras ancestry she valued her Greek Ptolemaic heritage the most.5
05 note 89 Ernle Bradford writes that Cleopatra challenged Rome not as an Egyptian woman but as a civilized Greek.5
06 Claims that Cleopatra was an illegitimate child never appeared in Roman propaganda against her.345
07 note 90 Strabo was the only ancient historian who claimed that Ptolemy XIIs children born after Berenice IV including Cleopatra were illegitimate.34507508 Cleopatra V or VI was expelled from the court of Ptolemy XII in late 69 BC a few months after the birth of Cleopatra while Ptolemy XIIs three younger children were all born during the absence of his wife.40 The high degree of inbreeding among the Ptolemies is also illustrated by Cleopatras immediate ancestry of which a reconstruction is shown below.note 
91 The family tree given below also lists Cleopatra V as a daughter of Ptolemy X Alexander I and Berenice III. This would make her a cousin of her husband Ptolemy XII but she could have been a daughter of Ptolemy IX Lathyros which would have made her a sisterwife of Ptolemy XII instead.50934 The confused accounts in ancient primary sources have also led scholars to number Ptolemy XIIs wife as either Cleopatra V or Cleopatra VI the latter may have actually been a daughter of Ptolemy XII. Fletcher and John Whitehorne assert that this is a possible indication Cleopatra V had died in 69 BC rather than reappearing as a coruler with Berenice IV in 58 BC during Ptolemy XIIs exile in Rome.56510
